In a mixing bowl, combine the butter and granulated sugar and beat, with a whisk or hand mixer, until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides periodically. Add the orange zest and beat in the whole eggs one at a time. Stir in the vanilla. Gently mix in the flour, baking powder and salt. Once the flour is incorporated, fold in the almonds, raisins and anise. Divide the dough into two pieces. If the dough is sticky, dust your hands with a little flour. Roll the dough into two logs the length of a sheet tray and place on the tray. Beat the egg white with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush the logs with the egg white and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Bake until dark golden brown, slightly crisp around the edges and still a bit soft in the middle, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven to a cutting board and slice on the bias with a serrated knife while they are still warm. Slicing while warm will prevent crumbling. Lay the biscotti back on the sheet tray(s), cut-sides down, and return to the oven until a little more golden around the edges, another 10 minutes. This will harden the biscotti but not make them like rocks. Remove from the oven to a serving platter and serve with coffee or Vin Santo for dipping.

Spray the edges of the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Put 1/2 cup of the pepitas in a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the flaxseed meal, sesame seeds, chia seeds, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne and kosher salt to the bowl and whisk to combine. Stir together the sriracha and 1 cup water in a small bowl. Add the water mixture to the seed mixture and stir until the mixture begins to gel together, about 1 minute.<br> Pour the seed mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Use an offset spatula to spread the mixture evenly to the edges, smoothing it out to about 1/4 inch thick. (It is important to spread the cracker mixture evenly so it bakes evenly.) Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup pepitas and some flaky sea salt.<br> Bake until golden brown around the edges and the center feels firm (not spongy) when poked, 40 to 45 minutes. Flip the sheet of crackers over and bake for an additional 5 minutes to crisp the crackers all the way through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, then break into 2-inch shards.<br> For the soup: Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment.<br> Toss the cauliflower with the paprika, a pinch of salt and black pepper and 2 tablespoons of the oil on the prepared baking sheet. Roast until the cauliflower is caramelized around the edges and tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes.<br> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the turmeric, ginger, white pepper, cinnamon and garlic and stir to combine. Stir in the vegetable broth, coconut milk and roasted cauliflower. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then cover and simmer until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes.<br> Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until smooth and no lumps remain; alternatively, let cool slightly and puree in a blender.

Return a list of the wine types only. recipe: Baked Brie with Fresh Berries 1 (8 oz) round of brie cheese 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp chopped&quot; 41255,&quot;Deep Fried Balloon Bread (Poori) 1 cup of atta/chapati flour (Indian whole-wheat bread or 1/2 cup whole wheat flour plus 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour) 1 tablespoon of corn, peanut or vegetable oil 1/3 cup water Unbleached all-purpose flour for dusting Corn, peanut or vegetable oil, enough to fill a kadhai or a skillet to a depth of 3 inches Instructions: Place the flour in a large shallow bowl. Add 1 tablespoon oil and rub into it. Add water in a stream, first fast then slowly as the flour begins to adhere together. Gather the dough and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes, dusting with flour if it sticks. Brush with oil, cover and let dough rest for 15 minutes. To make the dough in the food processor, place flour and oil in the food processor. With the steel blade attached, machine running, add water in a thin stream through the feed tube. The flour will adhere together into a mass and a dough ball will form on the blades. Process for 1 minute, with on and off motion, to knead the dough. Carefully remove dough to a work surface.<br> Roll dough into 12-inch long rope and cut into 12 equal parts. Roll each piece of dough into smooth balls. Or, alternatively, pinch off 1-inch round portions of dough from the whole and roll into a smooth ball. Dust the balls lightly to prevent sticking. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Start heating the oil in a wok or a chicken fryer to 375 degrees. Working one at a time, pick up one ball, dust with flour and place on the work surface. Press firmly to flatten it, turning it once. Roll the patty into a thin round circle dusting often with flour to prevent sticking. Roll few breads the same way and keep them on the work board, covered, to prevent them from drying out. DO NOT STACK. Lift one bread and gently drop it in the hot oil. When the bread is puffed and the underside golden brown, turn with a slotted spoon and fry the other side. Take it out and drain briefly on paper towels. Repeat with the rest of the rolled bread the same way. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 41256,&quot;Roasted Red Pepper Mousse 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 onions, diced 4 roasted red peppers, peeled, seeded and finely chopped 2 cups/250 ml chicken or vegetable stock 2 tablespoons tomato paste Salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch piment d&#39;espelette or cayenne pepper 4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin Squirt of lemon juice 1 cup/250 ml heavy cream Instructions: Heat the oil in a saute pan and gently cook the garlic and onions until soft.

Using a sharp thin knife, cut a slit into the flesh side of the veal chop almost to the bone. With your hand placing pressure on the top of the chop, move the knife in a slicing motion to form a 3-inch pocket in the chop. Cover the chop with a piece of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet or a small heavy skillet, gently pound the chop until it is about 1/3 inch thick. Remove the plastic wrap and discard. Stuff one piece of the fontina cheese into the pocket and close the meat around it. On one side of the chop, place 3 small sage leaves on the meat. Cover the sage leaves with 2 pieces of cheese and follow that with 2 pieces of prosciutto. Turn over the chop and repeat on the other side. Place the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow dishes and season each of them with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Season the flour with the pepper. Dredge both sides of the prosciutto-wrapped veal chop in the flour and shake off the excess. Then place the chop into the egg, followed by the panko, packing the breadcrumbs on to the chop to help them stick. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the breaded chop and cook until the breadcrumbs on the first side are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using tongs or a spatula, carefully flip the chop and continue to cook until the other side is golden brown as well. Remove the chop to a baking tray and roast in the oven until cooked to 155 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the veal to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat, maintain the heat at a simmer, and poach the breasts for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on their size. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the chicken to cool to room temperature. When the chicken is cool, remove it from the stock (which can be strained and used for another purpose), remove and discard the skin and bones, and chop the meat finely. Meanwhile, cook the bacon until it is crisp. Drain the bacon well and chop in roughly, by hand or in a food processor. Place the chopped bacon on paper towels and dry further, in a conventional oven on a low heat or in a microwave oven, until it separates into bits. This process may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times, depending on the fat content of the bacon used. Place the Roquefort cheese in the freezer for about 15 minutes; then remove the cheese from the freezer and grate it, using a cheese or vegetable grater. Cut the tomatoes into small dice and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Halve, peel, and dice the avocados; sprinkle with salt and fresh lemon juice. Using a food processor, chop the greens finely, into 3/16 inch bits, but do not reduce them to mush. Finely chop the hard boiled eggs. To assemble the salad, place all the greens in a large bowl and toss them together; spread the greens evenly in the bottom of the bowl. Arrange the bacon, egg, chicken, tomato, and cheese in strips across the greens; arrange the chopped avocado around the edge of the salad. Bring the salad to the table with the dressing alongside and toss together just before serving. Blend together all ingredients except the oils. Using a whisk or food processor, combine the oils and add them in a very fine stream, continuing to whisk until the mixture is well combined.

Bring the ginger, sugar and 1/4 cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan. Cook on medium-low for 10 minutes. Let cool completely at room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, brush the peach halves all over with the butter. Place them cut-side down on the grill, and grill until very charred, about 5 minutes. Flip the peaches, and grill until the rounded side is charred in spots and the peaches are tender but not falling apart, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool completely, about 20 minutes. Put the cooled peaches, preserves, 1/2 cup of the almond milk, lemon juice and a small pinch of salt in a blender. Strain the cooled ginger syrup into the blender, pressing the ginger pieces in the strainer with the back of a spoon to extract as much flavor as possible; discard the ginger. Puree the peach mixture until completely smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender partway through if needed. Transfer the mixture to a large liquid measuring cup with a pouring spout. Pour the mixture into the ice-pop molds, leaving 1/4 inch of space at the top (the mixture will expand). Insert the sticks. Freeze until solid, 5 hours to overnight. When ready to serve, put the remaining 1/2 cup almond milk in one drinking glass and the almonds in another. Unmold the ice pops, and dip the top of each into the almond milk, then into the almonds. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 41302,&quot;Tri-Color Bullseye Spritz Cookies 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 to 3 drops each of 3 gel food colors Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add and mix in 1 egg at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl between each addition. Add the vanilla and mix. Whisk together the flour and salt in a medium bowl and add to the butter mixture, beating until the flour is just incorporated. Separate the cookie dough into 3 bowls as follows: a small amount for the center of the bullseye then divide the rest equally for the other 2 rings. Add 2 to 3 drops of one of the food colors to the small bowl, stirring to distribute the color evenly. Repeat with a different food color for each of the remaining bowls of dough. Place each colored dough in separate piping bags, making sure to put the smallest amount of dough in the bag with the smallest tip. Starting with the outside of each bullseye, pipe 3-inch rings onto the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. Use the next bag to pipe the second colored ring inside the first ring, then use the third bag to fill in the center of the bullseye. If the edges of the piped rings overlap, use a bit of water to moisten a finger and smooth out the uneven section. Freeze the bullseyes for 10 minutes before baking. Then bake until the cookies are set but not yet golden brown, about 11 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees at the halfway mark. Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 41303,&quot;Plantain Chips Patacones 2 green plantains 1 cup vegetable oil, plus more if necessary Salt Instructions: Cut off the ends of the plantains and then carefully cut a slit down the length of the skin without cutting into the plantain itself. Using a wooden spoon, pry up the edges of the peel and pull off the skin. Once the peel is removed cut the plantain crosswise into 3 or 4 pieces, each about 2 to 3 inches long. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over high heat until it shimmers, about 3 minutes. Add the plantains and fry them until they turn golden on all sides, about 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, then place between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Reduce the heat to medium. Flatten the plantains by pressing down on them with a heavy-bottomed pan. Return 1/2 of the flattened plantains to the oil and re-fry until deep golden on both sides, about 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer back to the paper towel-lined plate to drain and repeat with the remaining flattened plantains. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 41304,&quot;Next Day Rice and Broccoli Soup 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup chopped onion or shallots 1/2 apple, peeled and finely diced 1 cup or more cooked broccoli, finely chopped 2 cups broth or water 1/4 to 1/2 cup cooked rice Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat butter in a small saucepan.

To make the crust, crush the cookies in a food processor (or smash in a ziptop bag with a rolling pin). Stir in the melted butter until combined. Pour into a regular pie pan and press the crumbs all over the pan and up the sides. Bake just long enough for it to set, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool completely. Put the raspberries on a plate or in an empty pan. Smash them with a fork, then sprinkle on the sugar. Stir together and allow to sit for 15 minutes. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the raspberry yogurt with the instant vanilla pudding mix (just the powder itself). Beat on low until combined, about 1 minute. Pour in the heavy cream and whip on low for 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Turn the mixer on medium-high speed and beat until thick, about 2 minutes. Turn off the mixer, then fold in the raspberries until just combined. Pour into the cooled crust and spread evenly. Freeze until very firm, about 2 hours.

Season with a pinch of salt. Make a deep well in the middle of the flour, about 6 inches in diameter. Combine the eggs, egg yolks, olive oil and a pinch of salt together in a mixing bowl and mix well. Slowly add the egg mixture to the well in the flour, using a fork to start grabbing bits of flour from the outside of the well to mix into the egg mixture in the middle. Keep incorporating the sides of the well into the center until a tacky dough ball is formed. Knead the dough ball by hand until all the flour has fully incorporated. Wrap the dough ball well and let rest in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. For the filling: Combine the shrimp, Calabrian chiles, bacon, lemon and pinch of salt in a food processor. Puree for 10 to 15 seconds, then scrape down the sides and add the basil. Puree briefly until combined. Using a pasta roller, roll out the dough into 2 sheets of pasta thin enough to where you can feel your fingers through them (usually a number 5 to 6 on the sheeter setting). Place one sheet of the pasta dough on a well-floured surface. If using a cutter to make ravioli shapes, gently mark on the pasta sheet to see where the filling should be piped. Brush the dough with water. Add dollops of filling spaced out evenly across the middle of the sheet, using the marks as a guide. Gently brush a little bit of water over the second sheet of pasta. Place the sheet, dampened-side down, over the one with the filling, gently lining up the edges. Using your fingers, press and seal around the filling, making the seal as airtight as possible. Use a ring cutter or knife to cut out ravioli. Use your fingers to gently seal the edges and remove any air pockets and transfer the ravioli to a baking sheet sprinkled with semolina. For the sauce: Put a bit of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, garlic and thyme leaves, then add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes start to soften and burst, 7 to 10 minutes. Move the shallot mixture to one side of the pan, then remove the pan from the heat and deglaze with the vodka. Carefully ignite the vodka, slightly tipping the pan away from you. Once the flame subsides, return to the heat and cook at a simmer until the vodka has been reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 2 minutes. Add the cream, crushed Calabrian chiles, lemon juice and basil leaves and cook until the sauce is thickened and has reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and drop the fresh ravioli in. Cook just until it floats, about 1 1/2 minutes. Take the ravioli out of the pot with a skimmer or slotted spoon and place in the saute pan with a splash of pasta water. Toss the sauce and ravioli together over low heat. Using a large spoon, place the ravioli on plates and add more sauce over the top. Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barolo]&quot; 41310,&quot;Orange-sicle Spritzer 1 pint vanilla ice cream 16 ounces orange soda 1 orange, sliced thin, for garnish 1/4 cup sugar, for garnish Instructions: Place 2 (1/4-cup) scoops of vanilla ice cream in each of 4 serving glasses.

Place on a plate and microwave, flipping halfway through, until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool until easy to handle. Cut off the squash stem, then cut the squash in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop the flesh into a large bowl, discarding the seeds and leaving about 1/4 inch of flesh within the skin to help maintain its shape. Level off the squash halves so they rest without tilting by cutting a tiny slice off each skin side. Place on a baking sheet, flesh-side up. Add the rice, bocconcini, raisins, walnuts, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper to the bowl with the scooped squash and mix well to combine. For the sausage: Add the olive oil, onions, sausage, curry powder, thyme and salt and pepper to taste to a large pan over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up the sausage into small crumbles, until the sausage is cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Add to the bowl with the squash and stir to combine. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fill the hollowed squash halves with the mixture and roast it until the cheese melts and the tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with the cilantro, drizzle over some olive oil and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 41313,&quot;Whimsical Flower Cupcakes 24 Go-To Vanilla Cupcakes 2 cups Swiss Buttercream 1/2 cup Grapefruit-Tinted Frosting 1/4 cup Egg Yolk-Tinted Frosting Instructions: Frost the cupcakes with the buttercream.

Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a medium saucepot fitted with a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil without stirring; cook until the mixture reaches 305 degrees F (the hard-crack stage), 12 to 15 minutes -- the sugar will become deeply caramelized. Remove the pot from the heat and carefully add the butter, baking soda, vanilla paste and fennel; the sugar will bubble up and incorporate all the ingredients on its own. With a heatproof rubber spatula, stir in the pistachios and then immediately spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in an even layer. While the brittle is still hot, zest the orange evenly over the top and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Let the brittle cool completely before breaking into small pieces.

F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, malted milk powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture in two additions, alternating with the sour cream, until just combined.<br> Drop mounds of dough (2 tablespoons each) about 2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the bottoms and edges of the cookies are set and just starting to brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the pans, then remove the cookies to racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the icing: Sift the confectioners\\u2019 sugar and malted milk powder into a large bowl. Add the corn syrup, vanilla and hot water and whisk until thick but spreadable. (If the mixture is too thick, add more hot water, 1 teaspoon at a time.) Remove half of the icing to a medium bowl. Using a rubber spatula, fold 1/2 teaspoon white food coloring into one bowl of icing, adding more food coloring if needed. Fold 1/2 teaspoon red food coloring and the cocoa powder into the remaining bowl of icing, adding more food coloring if needed.<br> Flip the cookies flat-side up on the racks. Spread the white icing on half of each cookie using a small offset spatula, sprinkle with white coarse sugar and return to the racks. Refrigerate until set, 15 to 20 minutes. (For a neat line between the 2 colors, lay a piece of foil or wax paper halfway across each cookie before spreading the white icing, then remove after refrigerating.) Spread the red icing on the other half of the cookies and sprinkle with red coarse sugar. Let set at room temperature, at least 2 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41327,&quot;Baked Alaska 2 quarts (8 cups) super-premium vanilla ice cream 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) super-premium chocolate ice cream 1 cup orange marmalade Decadent Brownie, recipe follows 8 egg whites, at room temperature 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 2 cups sugar Cooking spray 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch-process) 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1 1/3 cups sugar 1 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 eggs 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: To make the ice cream dome, remove the ice cream from the freezer and allow to soften slightly. Line a 3-quart bowl with plastic wrap. In another bowl, beat the marmalade into the softened vanilla ice cream with a wooden spoon until combined. Spoon 2 cups of the orange-vanilla ice cream into the bowl and smooth with a spoon or offset spatula to even. Top with the chocolate ice cream, again smoothing to even, tand hen top the chocolate layer with the remaining 6 cups orange-vanilla ice cream. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and freeze until the ice cream is very hard, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours. Turn the brownie out onto a large, flat, ovenproof plate. Unmold the ice cream dome on top of the brownie layer. Place the cake back in the freezer. Hold in the freezer until the meringue is ready. In electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar for 2 minutes on medium-high speed until fluffy. Increase the speed to high and add the sugar in a slow stream until stiff, glossy peaks form, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the ice cream dome from the freezer. Remove the plastic wrap. Cover the ice cream dome completely with the meringue, using the back of a spoon to make swirly peaks. (Alternately, place the meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a rose tip and pipe spikes for a hedgehog look.) Freeze for at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. When ready to serve, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Bake until the peaks start to turn a golden brown color, 3 to 5 minutes. For easier slicing, let the cake stand for 30 minutes. Slice and serve. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and grease the parchment well. For your brownie batter, melt your butter in a medium (or large) heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. While the butter is melting, whisk the cocoa powder, sea salt and sugar in a separate bowl. (The sugar and salt will work as abrasive agents to get any lumps out of the cocoa.) Whisk the cocoa/sugar/salt combo into the melted butter until the sugar has dissolved fully. The mixture should look like fudge and pull away from the bowl into a ball. Take off the stove and set the pan on a dishtowel on your counter. Allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it&#39;s warm, but not hot anymore. Stir the vanilla into the cooled fudge mixture to loosen it up. Add the eggs into the mixture 1 at a time, adding the second egg after the first egg is fully incorporated. The batter should look shiny and well blended. Add in your flour and stir it until it&#39;s fully incorporated. Once it looks fully blended, beat the batter vigorously for at least 45 strokes. This&#39;ll not only get out any pent up stress, but it will make the brownies chewy. Fold in your chocolate chips. Spread the thick and fudgy brownie batter evenly in the lined pan with an offset spatula or your greased hands. Pop the brownie in the oven and bake until they get a nice crust and your house smells like brownies, 20 to 25 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack or a dishtowel on your counter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 41328,&quot;Marinated Chicken Thighs 2 cups fresh parsley leaves, chopped 8 large sprigs fresh thyme, chopped 4 large sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 small shallot, diced 2 tablespoons cracked black peppercorns 2 tablespoons cracked pink peppercorns 1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil 8 skin-on chicken thighs Flaky salt, such as Maldon, for seasoning Salad, for serving Instructions: Mix the parsley, thyme, rosemary, garlic, shallots, black peppercorns and pink peppercorns together in a bowl.

While whisking add the sugar slowly until fully dissolved. Add vanilla, heavy cream, milk, and salt and continue to whisk. In order to get rid of air bubbles in mixture, transfer to large bowl through a fine strainer. In the bottom of 6 (1/2 cup) ramekins (small ceramic custard cups), place about 1 1/2 teaspoons of caramel. When all 6 ramekins have caramel at the bottom, brush each bottom and side with melted butter to secure flan and yet allow it to be removed easily. Fill each ramekin with the flan mixture, SLOWLY to avoid air bubbles, until about 2/3 full. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place almost full ramekins in shallow baking pan and then fill the pan with boiling water. The hot water bath will allow the flan cups to cook evenly in the oven. Right before placing pan in oven, top each ramekin with a tablespoon of hot espresso. Bake for 40 minutes. When removing pan from oven, allow the ramekins to remain cooling in their original water bath, overnight if necessary. Before serving, place ramekins in another shallow pan of warm water to loosen the custard.

Set aside. For the brisket: Trim excess fat from the outside of the brisket, keeping about 1/2-inch layer of fat on. Chop up excess fat and place it in a pot with 1 cup of the vegetable oil. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the fat starts to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Turn off heat and let cool, then strain to remove all the fat chunks. Set aside. Rub some of the remaining 1/4 vegetable oil all around the outside of the brisket. Rub brisket liberally with 3/4 cup BBQ rub (save remainder for another use). Rub the rest of the vegetable oil on top of the BBQ rub. (When putting rub on meat, just remember, \\oil, rub, oil.) Let the brisket rest, covered and refrigerated, overnight. (If you are in a hurry, you could let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours and it should turn out okay.) Heat an outdoor grill to 350 degrees F. Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F. Sear the outside of the meat on all sides on the grill. Since we are not using a smoker, it is important to get some open flame action to caramelize the outside of the meat so we get some smoke flavor. Cover the meat with foil or thick butcher paper and place in a hotel pan. Transfer to the oven and roast for 12 hours or overnight. Let cool. For the coffee BBQ sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepot, then add garlic and shallots. Cook, stirring, until they start to caramelize. Add the BBQ sauce, coffee and bay leaf and simmer on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, for about 30 minutes. Let cool, remove the bay leaf and puree in a blender (optional). Set aside. Ready to make the sandwiches! Slice the brisket about 1/4-inch-thick and place in a large enough saute pan that each piece can be flat in the pan in a single layer. Add just enough BBQ sauce to come about halfway up the side of the meat. Heat the pan on medium to high heat. Meanwhile, split the burger buns. Toast the buns and add the melted butter to the insides. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Fry shoestring potatoes until they start to turn golden brown, then add the sliced jalapenos to the fryer and continue frying until the fries are golden and jalapenos are crispy but still bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Let drain, then place in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Meanwhile, pay attention to the brisket in the pan. Turn each piece over on the other side with tongs and continue searing. Pour about 1/4 cup beef fat into another saute pan. Heat on medium-high heat and add the sliced onions. Cook the onions down until they start to get a dark caramelization-thing going on, then add salt and pepper to taste. Turn off heat, drain excess oil and set aside. At this point the brisket should be looking good. You want there to be a deep-dark crust forming on the outside. Time to assemble! Place buns on a tray, lay your Cheddar down on the bottom, add the BBQ brisket on top, beef fat onions on top of the brisket, jalapeno shoestrings on top of the onions, put on your bun lids\\u2026DONE! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 41355,&quot;Rib-Eye Steak 6 rib-eye steaks 1/2 cup chili powder Salt and cracked pepper 2 teaspoons garlic 2 teaspoons onion powder 2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika 4 dashes liquid smoke Instructions: Combine all the ingredients and rub on rib-eye steaks.

Fill a clean sink with ice cold water and add the apple cider vinegar. Quickly dip the apples in the boiling water for 5 to 7 seconds for wax removal. Immediately place the apples in the ice water. Use a clean potato cloth (or any cloth with a raised surface) to dry the apples and buff away any residual wax. Place the dried apples on parchment paper. Wipe any excess sap or wax off the apples, then skewer with wooden sticks. Place a large saucepan on medium-high heat; add the butter. Allow to melt completely, then add the brown sugar. Blend until the butter is fully incorporated with the sugar, then add the sweetened condensed milk, stirring until blended. Add the corn syrup, vanilla extract and sea salt. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce the heat to medium to avoid burning the mixture. Cook, stirring, until the mixture reaches 240 to 245 degrees F. Remove the mixture from the heat, then work quickly to dip the apples in the mixture, turning to ensure complete coverage. Place the apples on the lined baking sheet.

Combine the butter, peanut butter and brown sugar in another medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the flour mixture and blend until just combined. Shape the dough into a log: Place it onto a piece of plastic wrap about 18 inches long. Use your hands to pat the dough into a log about 7 inches long and 2 inches around. Roll the plastic wrap around the dough. Twist both ends of the wrap, like a candy, and tighten both sides until the dough log is compact and tightly wrapped (this might cause the dough to shrink down to a 6-inch log instead of a 7-inch log, but that is okay). Tuck the twisted ends under the dough and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. When ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and arrange 2 racks in the middle of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and use a sharp knife to slice the dough into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. Place the rounds about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets, about 12 cookies per baking sheet. Press a halved peanut into the center of each cookie. If the dough is still very cold, it might crack slightly around the peanut. Simply use your finger to lightly push the dough back together. Bake the cookies until the edges are very lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Halfway through cooking, rotate the baking sheets front to back and top to bottom. Cool the cookies slightly on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41359,&quot;Beer Can Chicken 2 cups mesquite or apple wood chips, soaked in cold water for 1 hour 1 (3 to 4-pound) roasting chicken, preferably kosher (since it has been brined) Vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup Bobby Flay&#39;s 16 Spice Rub for Chicken, or your favorite dry spice rub recipe, divided 1 (12-ounce) can beer 2 cloves garlic, crushed 2 sprigs fresh rosemary Instructions: Prepare a kettle grill with charcoal off to one side for indirect grilling and add the soaked apple wood or mesquite wood chips over the coals.

Open the beer can, pour out about 1/2 cup of the beer into a cup and drink it (or pour it over the wood chips). Make an extra hole in the top of the can with a church-key can opener. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon dry rub to the beer can (it might fizz up a little bit at the top, but don&#39;t worry, that is normal), the garlic and rosemary. Hold the chicken above the can of beer and slide the chicken over the can. Fold the wings back behind the chicken. Make sure the legs are in front of the can, supporting the chicken. Place the chicken inside a disposable pan. Place the pan on the grates of the grill on the opposite side of the charcoals, put lid on and cook the chicken until golden brown and the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F in the breast area and 175 degrees F in the thigh area on an instant-read thermometer, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the grill (be careful not to spill the contents of the beer can as it will be very hot) and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.

Sausage: Add all of the ingredients, except the cabbage, carrots and cucumber, to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade attachment. Pulse until the mixture is blended but its texture is still slightly chunky. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat and add the cabbage leaves. Blanch for 30 seconds. Transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking and cool. Remove the leaves from the ice bath and arrange them on a sheet tray lined with a kitchen towel. Put a cabbage leaf onto a clean work surface. Halve the large stem in the middle of the cabbage widthwise so that it is thin enough to be rolled without the stem breaking. Spread 1/4 cup of the seafood mixture over the bottom 1/3 of the cabbage leaf. Tightly roll the leaf up halfway. Fold the sides of the leaf inward toward the center of the roll to keep the filling contained. Tightly roll the sausage up the remaining way. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Make 3 punctures in each roll with a toothpick to allow any excess moisture to escape during the cooking process. Set up a bamboo or vegetable steamer over a pot of simmering water. If you do not have a steamer, you can use a colander. Arrange the sausages in the steamer and steam until they are cooked through, about for 10 minutes. Remove them from the steamer to let cool for 5 minutes. Slice each sausage lengthwise 3/4 of the way through, leaving the bottom still intact. Split the sausages open and top them with the julienned carrots and cucumbers. Drizzle with the mustard and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 41397,&quot;Moist &amp; Savory Stuffing 2? cups Swanson?

Put the chicken wings in a large bowl and pour in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Make the pickled pineapple: Combine the vinegar and sugar in a large saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime, orange and yuzu juices. Add the pineapple, onion, roasted red peppers and 2 tablespoons salt. Let sit at room temperature until the pineapple is completely cool and tender, at least 3 hours. Add the cilantro. Make the wings: Soak the wood chips in water at least 30 minutes; drain. Heat a charcoal grill and prepare for indirect grilling: Bank the coals to one side, leaving the other side empty. Set up a drip pan on the empty side. Let the fire burn down to a very low heat (165 degrees F to 175 degrees F). Scatter some of the wood chips over the hot coals. Remove the wings from the marinade (no need to wipe them off) and arrange on the cooler side of the grill, over the drip pan. Cover the grill and adjust the vents to maintain a low heat. Cook 2 hours, adding more wood chips halfway through and more charcoal as needed. Remove the wings from the grill. Spread out the coals and bring the grill temperature up to medium high (325 degrees F to 350 degrees F). Grill the wings over direct heat, covered and turning often, until the meat easily pulls away from the bone, 20 to 25 minutes.

Transfer it to a 11 x 17-inch sheet tray lined with parchment paper and fit the dough to the tray exactly. Be sure the dough is evenly rolled - about 3/8-inch thick. Freeze the sheet tray for about 1/2 hour. Remove the tray from the freezer and using a fluted 2 1/4-inch round cutter, cut out 24 to 28 circles. Using a fork, dock each round well in the center, 4 to 6 times; leave a 1/4-inch rim undocked. The circles can be put back in the freezer for up to 2 months. Once they&#39;re frozen, they can be stacked and wrapped in plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Heat some oil in a saute pan and cook the onions slowly, until they are soft and fully cooked. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool. Slice the tomatoes about 3/8-inch thick. Cut off broccoli flowers about 1 1/4 inches around. Cut them as close to the flower as possible, without them falling apart. Cut the stems off the mushrooms flush with the bottom of the cap (don&#39;t hollow them) and slice as thinly as possible. Fill a little bowl with about 1-inch of oil. Place the rounds of dough, upside down on a papered cookie sheet and dock again. Brush about 1/3 with oil, spread about 1/3 with a little olive paste or pesto, and spoon about 1/2 of the cooled onions on the remaining rounds. Sprinkle each with Parmesan. Place a tomato slice on the rounds spread with oil only; the slice should be the same size or a little smaller than the round of dough. Garnish with a few strips of fresh basil. Dip each broccoli flower into the oil, head down, and press it, flower up, into the center of each round spread with olive paste. Press a sliced mushroom cap into the center of each onion round. Slant the cap a little so that the slices separate. Brush each round generously with oil and sprinkle generously with Parmesan, salt and pepper. Bake for about 17 minutes or until the bottoms are lightly browned.

Brownies: Melt the chocolate and butter together over low heat, stirring frequently. Remove from heat to cool slightly. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine chocolate-butter mixture with sugar, vanilla, and eggs on medium speed for 1 minute, scraping down the sides of the bowl frequently. Mix in flour and salt and beat for 30 seconds. Scrape bowl and beat for 1 minute. Stir in chocolate chips. Mint Filling: Beat the cream cheese until smooth with electric mixer. Scrape sides of bowl and beat in sugar, eggs, and creme de menthe until smooth and fully blended. Add 2 drops food coloring to heighten filling color. Spread half of brownie mixture in a greased 13 by 9 by 2-inch pan. Pour mint filling on top of brownie batter and spread to edge. Carefully spread the other half of the brownie mixture on top of the mint filling. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until sides pull away from pan and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan. Frosting: Beat butter until smooth with electric mixer. Add sugar and melted chocolate to butter and beat. Slowly add mint extract and enough milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to make desired consistency. Spread frosting on top of cooled chocolate mint brownies.

You can mix by hand or with a food processor or mixer, but be careful not to over blend the dry ingredients. If you over-blend, your scones will be tough and chewy. Put the 7 dry ingredients in a bowl and add the cubes of butter. With your fingers, or with 2 knives, blend the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles a course cornmeal. Some large pieces of butter should remain, this will make your scones light and fluffy. If you are using a processor, pulse briefly. Stir in the ginger bits. Add the milk and work quickly with a fork to incorporate. The dough should be soft and lightly moist. Again, don&#39;t over-mix. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and gently pat down until it stands about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into 12 triangles with a dough cutter or a knife and put onto an ungreased baking sheet. Brush the tops of the scones with the egg wash and sprinkle with some sugar. Bake for 12 minutes until golden. Let cool briefly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 41412,&quot;Thai Chicken Salad with Peanuts and Lime 2 cooked chicken breast halves 4 cups chopped romaine lettuce 1 cup diced cucumber 1 cup diced tomato 1/2 cup chopped scallions 1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth 2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter 1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoon fresh lime juice 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1/4 cup dry roasted peanuts Instructions: Using a fork, pull chicken meat from bone in shreds.

Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl, and make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture, along with the remaining warm water. Using your hands, work the mixture into a dough, adding more water if necessary. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until pliable and springy, about 5 minutes. Place dough in an oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. Punch down risen dough and knead on a lightly floured surface. Roll into a log and cut into 2 to 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, place on floured surface and let rest 30 minutes under a towel. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F, and preheat baking sheets, tiles, or a baking stone. Prepare the filling: Melt the butter in a skillet, add the onion and saute until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and saute another minute. Transfer onion mixture to a large bowl, add remaining ingredients, and mix thoroughly with your fingertips. If mixture seems too dry, add a teaspoon of water. Place a ball of dough on a floured surface and roll into a round, flat circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Place the round on the oiled, preheated baking sheets or tiles. Brush the top with olive oil and spread with a thin, even layer of the meat filling, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator 30 minutes before making the knishes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F; lightly brush a baking sheet with olive oil. Make the knishes: Put the dough on a floured sheet of parchment paper; dust with flour. Stretch into a 6-by-8-inch rectangle, then use a rolling pin to roll into a 12-by-18-inch rectangle. With the long side of the dough in front of you, shape the filling into a tight log, leaving a 2-inch border on the side closest to you and 1 1/2 inches on each end. Use the parchment paper to help roll the dough around the filling, stretching the dough as needed to keep it tight. Brush off the flour as you roll. Pinch the dough closed at the seam, then carefully turn the roll seam-side down on the parchment paper. Pull on the ends of the dough and twist to seal; pinch off the excess dough. Press the handle of a wooden spoon into the log to divide it into 3 even sections. Seal each piece closed by stretching the dough over the open sides; twist the dough and pinch off any excess. Cut each piece in half with a sharp knife to make 6 knishes. They should be closed on one side. With the cut side up, stretch the dough partly over the filling, leaving some exposed. Flatten each knish slightly so it is about 1 1/2 inches high. Place the knishes 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake 30 minutes; brush with olive oil and continue baking until golden, 25 to 35 more minutes.

Especially when paired with halloumi cheese, which I just love. It&#39;s a Cypriot cheese made from goat&#39;s or sheep&#39;s milk and you can get it from all good supermarkets. It&#39;s like a chewy feta but one you can cook with. When fried or broiled it goes all crispy on the outside and soft and slightly chewy on the inside. A brilliant thing to eat. In a bowl, drizzle the sliced strawberries with a good splash of balsamic vinegar, the lemon juice and some extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. This will draw out and flavor the lovely strawberry juices. Preheat a large nonstick frying pan to medium hot and add a splash of olive oil. Press a basil leaf onto each slice of halloumi. Place the slices, leaf side down, in the frying pan and fry for a minute. Turn over carefully and fry for another minute until the halloumi is light golden and crisp. Get yourself 4 plates and place a couple of pieces of the crispy halloumi on each. Put the mint, the rest of the basil leaves and the salad leaves into the bowl with the strawberries and toss together. Pile some of the strawberry mixture in the middle of each plate and drape the speck over the top. Finish with more salad leaves. To serve, drizzle with balsamic vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and increase the speed to medium-high. Occasionally stopping to scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, continue to beat until it is pale and fluffy, an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and orange zest. Sift together the flour, spices and salt, then blend with the almond meal. Add this to the creamed butter all at once, then stir with a wooden spoon or spatula for a couple of turns. Return the bowl to the stand and mix on the lowest speed until the flour is just incorporated without over-mixing. Turn out the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap, push together to form a large flat disc, and wrap well. Refrigerate until very firm, at least 2 hours or overnight.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick liner.<br> Scoop out the dough in tablespoons, roll into a ball and place on the cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Season the tomato halves with kosher salt and pepper and set aside. Place the sugar in a large enameled cast iron braiser or saute pan over the direct heat side of the grill. Shake out into an even layer and allow to melt then caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and deglaze the pan, scraping the bottom of the pan for any brown bits. Stir in the garlic, onions and thyme, then the parsley and allow the liquid to melt back down. Remove from the heat. Place the tomatoes flesh side down on top of the onions. Place on the indirect heat side of the grill, close the lid and vents of the grill (this will make the temperature drop to 225 to 250 degrees F) and bake until the skins are wrinkly and the tomatoes have softened and given up more liquid, 2 hours. Brush another large enameled cast iron braiser or saute pan with the butter. When the tomatoes are ready, scoop the tomatoes out of their juices and place them in the buttered pan, cut side up and skin side down. Add the caramelized onions on top of the tomatoes. Using kitchen shears, cut off the square edges of the puff pastry, rounding the edges. Top the tomatoes and onions with the puff pastry round. Place the pan on the indirect heat side of the grill, with the air vents open, and cover the grill. The temperature should be around 425 degrees F. Bake until golden brown and the pastry is puffed, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 3 minutes before turning out on to a plate.

Arrange the mushrooms on a baking sheet, and broil until the sides facing up begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Flip, and continue to broil until the sides facing up are soft, about 5 minutes more. Let cool. Put the mushrooms, gill-side up, between 2 pieces of plastic wrap, and pound to about 1/4 inch thick with a meat mallet. Season all over with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Whisk together the milk and eggs in a separate shallow dish. Lower the oven heat to 250 degrees F. Put a rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Heat about an inch of oil to 350 degrees F in a large cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. While the oil heats, dredge each mushroom in the flour mixture to completely coat; shake off any excess. Then dip into the egg mixture until fully coated; let the excess drip off. Return the mushroom to the flour mixture, and dredge a second time, until completely coated, pressing firmly into the flour mixture. Arrange on one side of the rack on the baking sheet. Add 2 of the breaded mushrooms to the hot oil, and cook, turning once, until crisp and golden, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the mushrooms to the unused side of the rack. When the oil comes back to temperature, repeat with the remaining 2 mushrooms and keep the first 2 warm in the oven. Serve the mushroom steaks with mashed potatoes and generous spoonfuls of hot gravy. Garnish with chives or scallions if using. Position an oven rack in the top position in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Toss the onions, celery, carrots and garlic with the oil and 1 teaspoon salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until the vegetables are charred in some places, 25 to 30 minutes. Bring the roasted vegetables, 1 cup water, mushrooms, thyme, sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, bay leaf and 1 teaspoon salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is gone, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 6 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and bring back to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently simmer until reduced by about one third, about 45 minutes. Strain the stock into a large liquid measuring cup, then squeeze all the liquid out of the solids with the back of a ladle (there should be about 4 cups of stock); discard the solids. (If not making gravy right away, let the stock cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month; warm slightly before making gravy.) Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves to the butter, and stir for 30 seconds; remove the fried sage leaves, and set aside. Add the flour to the saucepan, and stir until smooth and lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour in the warm stock while whisking constantly until smooth and thick, 8 to 10 minutes.

Add the shrimp shells and tails, onion, carrot and celery and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, then add 10 cups of cold water, the tomatoes, parsley, bay leaf and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, skimming the surface occasionally, for 40 minutes. Strain the stock through a strainer lined with cheesecloth into a large bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids. The stock can be made 2 days in advance and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator, or frozen up to 3 months. For the tomato aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, anchovies, tomato powder, tomato paste, green onion, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. For the broth: Heat the oil in a large, high-sided saute pan over high heat and cook the fennel and onion until they begin to soften. Add the pastis and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, saffron, cl flakes and 2 cups of the shrimp stock. Bring to a boil, add the garlic and cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add 4 more cups of shrimp stock, reduce the heat and cook until the flavors meld and the broth reduces slightly, about 20 minutes. Strain the shrimp-tomato broth into a large bowl, discard the solids, pour the liquid back into the high-sided saute pan and set aside. For the anchovy butter: Put the anchovies and butter in a bowl and mix until combined. Season with salt and pepper, cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 20 minutes. For the seafood: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the scallops on both sides with salt and pepper. Sear the scallops on one side until golden brown, about 2 minutes, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds. Remove to a baking sheet. Add another tablespoon of the oil to the pan and season both sides of the halibut fillets with salt and pepper. Sear on one side until golden brown, then turn over and cook for 30 seconds. Remove to the baking sheet with the scallops. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the large saute pan, season the shrimp with salt and pepper and sear until the shells become lightly golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Deglaze the pan with 1 cup of the reserved shrimp-tomato broth. Transfer the liquid to the remaining shrimp-tomato broth in the high-sided saute pan. Heat the shrimp-tomato broth over high heat. Add the mussels, cover and cook until they open, about 2 minutes. Remove the mussels to the baking sheet with a slotted spoon and discard any that did not open. Add the seared seafood and lobster tails to the shrimp-tomato broth, cover and let cook for 2 minutes. To serve: Add the anchovy butter to the broth and cook until thickened; stir in the parsley, tarragon and lemon zest. Top each baguette slice with a large dollop of tomato aioli and garnish with chives. Divide the seafood and broth among 6 large, slightly shallow soup bowls. Top each with a tomato aioli crouton and garnish with more parsley or tarragon or chives, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 41507,&quot;Caramel Topped Cream Puffs 1 cup water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 eggs 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/3 cup water Ice cream of your choice, or lightly sweetened whipped cream Equipment: A pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip; 2 cookie sheets, well greased, or 1 lined with parchment paper and 1 greased, or lined with nonstick baking mats; an ice water bath; and a mini ice cream scoop Instructions: Make the Cream Puffs: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the water, butter, salt, and sugar in a large saucepan and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until the flour is incorporated, about 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 2 minutes to evaporate some of the moisture. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer or mix by hand.) Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, add 3 of the eggs, 1 at a time, stopping after each to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add another egg and mix until completely incorporated. Using a pastry bag, pipe the dough in bite-size \\kisses\\ (about 1 1/2 inches across) onto 1 of the cookie sheets. Dip your finger in flour and push down the points to smooth out any bumps. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 25 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. Make the Caramel: Pour the sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar to moisten it. Over high heat, bring to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pot occasionally to even out the color, until amber-caramel in color, 10 to 20 minutes. When the mixture is done, remove the pot from the heat and rest the bottom in the ice bath for 15 seconds to stop the cooking. Dip the top of each cream puff in the caramel and place it caramel-side down, with the base sticking straight up, on the other greased cookie sheet. The caramel will pool slightly around the puff and will harden and develop a foot. (When you turn the puffs over later, this will be a smooth flat \\lid\\ for each profiterole.) Let cool until set, at least 10 minutes. When ready to serve, carefully turn the puffs over and cut each 1 horizontally in 1/2 using a long serrated knife. Fill each with a small scoop of ice cream or sweetened, flavored whipped cream. Place the lid on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 41508,&quot;Grilled Pork Tacos with Pineapple 2 dried guajillo cl peppers 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for the grill 3 slices fresh pineapple (about 1/4 inch thick) Juice of 1/2 orange (about 3 tablespoons) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pork tenderloin (about 1 1/4 pounds) 1/2 cup finely chopped white onion Juice of 1 lime 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus whole leaves for topping 1 avocado 12 corn tortillas Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high. Put the chiles on a microwave-safe plate and microwave until fragrant and pliable, about 10 seconds (or toast in a small dry skillet over medium heat).

In medium saute pan, over medium high heat, saute the peppers and shallots in olive oil. Add the mango and papaya. Deglaze with vermouth. Add the chicken stock and clam juice, then add the crabmeat. Finish with scallions, and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. In a medium saute pan, over medium to high heat, cook the fish in olive oil, 3 to 4 minutes each side or until golden brown. Serve with mango and papaya sauce.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 41523,&quot;White Soda Bread and Scones 1 pound white unbleached flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 12 to 14 ounces buttermilk Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a mixing bowl sift together 1 pound flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. Make a well in the center. Pour most of the milk into the well. Using one hand, mix in the flour from sides of the bowl, adding more milk if necessary. The dough should be softish, not too wet and sticky. When it all comes together, turn the dough onto a well-floured counter. Wash and dry hands. Knead lightly for 1 second, just to tidy it up, flip over. Pat dough into a round about 1 1/2 inches deep and cut a cross into dough over the sides of the bread to let the fairies out. Bake in preheated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn down the oven to 400 degrees for another 30 minutes or until cooked. If in doubt, tap the bottom of the bread, it should sound hollow. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41524,&quot;Basic Pancake Batter 1 1/2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 egg About 1 cup milk 3 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled, plus extra for cooking Softened butter, for serving Maple syrup, room temperature, for serving Instructions: Heat a griddle or skillet until hot. Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Whisk together egg, milk and butter. Add egg mixture to the flour and stir just to moisten -- the batter will be lumpy, do not overmix. If too dry, add a few more spoonfuls of milk. Lower heat to medium-high and lightly brush griddle with butter. Spoon in the batter, by 1/4 cupfuls, spreading to 4-inch rounds. Cook until edges are dry and little bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook second side just until lightly browned. Transfer pancakes as they are made to warm plates and serve immediately, with butter and syrup.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41525,&quot;Bananas Foster 1 half-gallon vanilla ice cream in square container 8 crepes, recipe follows 4 bananas 8 tablespoon (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg Juice of one-half lemon 1/4 cup orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) 1/4 cup dark rum Confectioners&#39; sugar and fresh mint sprigs, for garnish, optional 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/8 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1 cup milk 1/4 cup water 3 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Instructions: Cover a baking sheet with plastic wrap or foil. Using a serrated knife, cut ice cream package in half lengthwise through the cardboard. Wrap one half in plastic wrap and freeze for another use. Halve the remaining piece lengthwise. Flip the ice cream, with the 2 pieces still together, so the cut side is up, and cut it crosswise into 4 equal sections - you&#39;ll have 8 pieces of ice cream.<br> Place a crepe on the work surface and place a piece of ice cream in the center. Fold the crepe over the ice cream to enclose completely. Place the filled crepes on the prepared baking sheet. Continue with the remaining ice cream and crepes and freeze until just firm. (This recipe can be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance. Wrap carefully in plastic wrap before freezing. Allow to soften slightly before proceeding.)<br> Peel and slice the bananas on a sharp angle into 2-inch pieces. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon juice and cook, stirring, until smooth and just at a simmer, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and add orange liqueur. Return skillet to high heat and stir until smooth. Carefully fold in bananas. Remove the skillet from heat and add the rum. Return the skillet to the heat, and shake the pan back and forth to warm the rum and coat the bananas. (If working over a gas flame the sauce may ignite; continue to cook until the flames subsides.)<br> To serve, place 2 filled crepes on a plate crisscrossing each other and spoon banana mixture over the top. Garnish with sifted confectioners&#39; sugar and a sprig of mint, if desired. Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually whisk in the milk, water, eggs and vanilla extract, and continue whisking until smooth. (The batter can be made to this point a day ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before adding the butter.) Stir in the butter. Set aside for at least 30 minutes to rest. (The crepe batter may be made in a food processor blender: Pulse the dry ingredients, then add the wet, process until smooth, and then stir in the butter.) Pour the batter into measuring cup with a spout.<br> Have a plate near the stove to stack the cooked crepes, or 4 plates, if you plan to serve the crepes immediately. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat until a drop of water bounces and sizzles briefly around the pan before evaporating. Pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet and quickly swirl it to coat the pan evenly. Cook until the batter sets, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The crepe will blister in the middle, and the edges will look dry and slightly crispy. Using your fingers or a spatula, carefully pick the crepe up by its edges and flip it over to cook the other side, about 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat with the rest of the batter, stacking the crepes on the plate as you go. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41526,&quot;Mexican Torta Burgers 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, preferably chuck Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for the grill<br> 4 soft kaiser rolls, split 1 avocado, halved, pitted and sliced Juice of 1/2 lime<br> 1 15-ounce can refried black beans, warmed 1/2 cup queso fresco cheese, crumbled Pickled jalapeno slices, for topping 1 1/2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce Instructions: Form the beef into four 6-ounce patties, about 3/4 inch thick; press the center of each patty with your thumb to make a 1/2-inch-deep indentation. Season the patties on both sides with salt and pepper. Lightly brush the grill grates with the vegetable oil, then grill the patties, indentation-side up, until marked on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until marked and slightly firm, about 3 more minutes for medium doneness. Remove the patties to a plate and let rest 5 minutes. Grill the rolls, cut-side down, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Toss the avocado and lime juice in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Spread the refried beans on the bun bottoms, then top with the burger patties, cheese, avocado, pickled jalapenos and lettuce. Cover with the bun tops.

Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter and melt together. Add shallots and cook for 2 minutes, or until translucent, and then toss the mushrooms, thyme, and bay leaf into the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their moisture and begin to turn golden brown. Pour 1 cup of the wine into the pan, and bring the liquid to a simmer, allowing the wine to evaporate. Continue cooking until the mushrooms are dry, about 5 to 7 minutes. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove mushrooms from the pan and set aside. Discard the bay leaf. Reduce the flame to low, and add the remaining butter and oil to the pan and melt. Stir in the rice and coat with the oil until the kernels are shiny, about 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in the remaining 1 cup of white wine and let evaporate.<br> Add the chicken broth, 1 ladle at a time, allowing the rice to absorb the liquid. Do not add too quickly so as to prevent the kernels from exploding. Stir over a gentle flame until each ladle of the liquid is absorbed. Repeat until most of the broth is incorporated and the risotto rice is al dente, about 25 minutes.<br> Fold the mushrooms back into the rice and season with salt, pepper and parsley. Stir in the Parmesan and finish with slices of white truffle, if available. Serve immediately. Put the chicken, vegetables, and giblets in a large stockpot over medium heat. Pour in enough cold water to cover by 1 inch (about 3 quarts); too much water will make the broth taste weak. Toss in the herbs and peppercorns and allow it to slowly come to a boil. Reduce the heat and gently simmer for 1 hour, uncovered, until the chicken is done. As the stock cooks, skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water, if necessary, to keep the chicken covered while simmering.<br> Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board. When it is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container and reserve for soups and salads.<br> Strain the stock into another pot through a fine sieve or a strainer lined with cheesecloth to remove excess fat and the vegetable solids. Use the stock immediately, or if you plan on storing it, place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock. Transfer to a storage container, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 41528,&quot;Morning Mango Fruit Salad with Key Lime Yogurt 1 (16-ounce) container fresh pineapple wedges, diced 16 ounces frozen mango chunks, thawed 1 (15-ounce) can lychee fruit, drained 1 (15-ounce) container fresh red grapefruit segments, drained 3/4 cup fat-free vanilla yogurt 2 teaspoons key lime juice (recommended: Nellie and Joe&#39;s) 1 pinch cayenne pepper 1/2 cup fresh raspberries Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine pineapple, mango, lychee, and grapefruit segments; set aside.

Stir together the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Combine the corn syrup, brown sugar, and margarine in a 2-quart saucepan. Stir constantly over medium heat until margarine is melted. Pour the syrup mixture over the flour mixture. Stir well, using your hands to mix as the dough becomes stiff. If you are using a heavy-duty Kitchen Aid mixer, the mixer can handle this dough; lightweight mixers cannot. Chill the dough 1 hour or until it is about room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Roll out the dough on nonstick baking parchment to a thickness of 1/8-inch. Using the patterns of your choice, cut out the necessary pieces. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Smaller pieces should be baked separately from larger ones, as baking times will vary depending on size. Check for air bubbles during baking and poke them with a knife or skewer. When baking is done, slide the parchment with the hot gingerbread onto a cooling rack. Make sure all the pieces lie flat. For the icing: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar. Place the egg whites in a mixer bowl. Add sugar and cream of tartar to egg whites while stirring. When all the sugar is incorporated, turn mixer to high and beat mixture until thick and very white. The icing should hold a stiff peak. The process takes about 5 to 7 minutes, longer if using a hand mid mixer. Cover the icing tightly with plastic wrap, as it dries very quickly. Use paste food colors to tint the icing. A tiny dot on a toothpick to a quarter cup of icing will make a nice pastel color, but be sure to add it a little at a time. With practice you will learn how much to use to get the color intensity you want. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 41538,&quot;Turkey Patty Melt with Grilled Onion Relish 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey Olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 8 (1/4-inch thick) slices good quality rye bread 8 (1/4-inch thick) slices Gruyere Grilled Onion Relish, recipe follows 2 red onions, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick slices Olive oil 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves Instructions: Heat grill to high.

Remove the turkey breast from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. Cut 3 pieces of kitchen twine and set aside. Add the butter, parsley, lemon zest, thyme, onion powder, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to a small bowl. Use a fork or a rubber spatula to incorporate all of the ingredients into the butter. Set aside. Pat the turkey breast dry. Using clean hands, starting at one end of the breast, slide your fingers under the skin to create a pocket between the meat and the skin. Use your hands to transfer the butter into the pocket and smooth the butter into an even layer. Use the kitchen twine to tie the turkey horizontally in 3 places. This will help the turkey breast cook evenly and remain juicy. Flip the turkey breast so that it is skin-side down. Drizzle it with 1 teaspoon olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Flip the turkey over and repeat the same seasoning process. Arrange the onion slices on a small rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1/3 cup water into the baking sheet and place the turkey breast on top of the onions. Transfer to the oven and roast for 1 hour. Remove the turkey from the oven and baste it with the butter and juices from the baking sheet. Continue to roast until the internal temperature is 160 degrees F, another 20 to 25 minutes. Allow the turkey to cool for 15 minutes. (In this time the internal temperature will rise another 5 degrees.)

Using 2 sheet trays, line 1 with a cooling rack and the other lined with parchment. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with a little olive oil, thyme leaves and salt and pepper, to taste. Put the potatoes on the sheet tray lined with the parchment. In a small bowl, combine the butter, ground cardamom, orange zest, ginger, salt and pepper, to taste. Stir together with a spoon until well mixed. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Poke a small opening in the clear membrane between the skin and the flesh of the chicken breast. Glide your index finger through the opening, loosening the skin from the flesh, without removing it completely. You&#39;re creating a big pocket in which the butter will sit! Repeat with the other chicken breasts. Put a spoonful of the butter mixture through the opening you made in the skin of the chicken breast. Once it&#39;s in there, smooth out the butter by gliding your finger over the skin, until it&#39;s evenly distributed. Repeat with the other breasts. Arrange the chicken breasts on the sheet tray lined with the cooling rack. Wash your hands thoroughly. If you wish, drizzle the skin with a little oil, for extra crispy skin. Season with salt, to taste. Put the potatoes and the chicken into the oven, and roast, turning the pans once halfway through the cooking time and stirring the potatoes, about 30 minutes. Relax, sip a glass of wine, and bask in the crackling sounds of butter and comforting smell of the roasted chicken! Chicken is ready when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, but not touching the bone, registers about 160 degrees F. Remove the pans from the oven and tent with foil. Allow them to rest about 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken and potatoes to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41566,&quot;Sweet and Spicy Deep-Fried Turkey One 12- to 14-pound turkey, neck, giblets and tail removed Kosher salt 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying 8 cloves garlic, finely grated 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger 1/2 cup honey 1/3 cup soy 1/4 cup mirin 2 tablespoons hoisin 2 tablespoons sambal 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar<br> Peanut or vegetable oil, for frying Steamed rice and steamed broccoli, for serving Instructions: Look at the label on the turkey and write down the exact weight. Place the turkey on a rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons salt all over the turkey, inside and out, nudging some into areas where the skin naturally separates from the bird, such as around the neck, top of the breast and between the legs and breast. Chill, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days. Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels, making sure there is no moisture anywhere, especially in the cavity. (Any wetness may cause dangerous splattering.) Place the turkey breast-side up in the basket of a turkey fryer or on the fry stand, depending on the type of deep fryer you have; follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Let the turkey sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 3.<br> Fill a turkey fryer with oil according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, following the specifications for the weight of your turkey (see Cook&#39;s Note). Heat to 375 degrees F (this could take 30 to 60 minutes depending on your fryer). Set a rack inside a rimmed baking sheet.<br> Lowering the turkey requires upper body strength so prepare yourself. Most fryers come with a hook to lower and raise the basket or fry stand in and out of the oil. Make sure to use the hook. Lift the basket over the fryer and carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the oil, inch by inch, until about half way, and then pause to allow the cavity to fill with oil. The oil will be bubbling vigorously and that?s ok. (If it starts to splatter violently, that could mean there is water on the turkey or that the turkey is still partially frozen. If that happens, remove the turkey from the oil and check to ensure the turkey is free of moisture and not still frozen.) Once the cavity is full of oil, continue lowering the turkey until it is completely submerged. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions regarding cooking covered or uncovered, adjusting the heat. Continue cooking until the turkey is golden brown, 3 1/2 to 4 minutes per pound, 40 to 50 minutes.<br> Carefully remove the turkey from the oil and transfer to the prepared rack to drain and cool, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the honey, soy, mirin, hoisin, sambal and rice vinegar and cook, stirring occasionally, until very thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Remove the turkey from the basket or fry stand and liberally brush with the glaze, making sure to get into every nook and cranny. Let sit 15 minutes. Repeat basting and sitting two more times. Reserve remaining sauce for serving. Serve with steamed rice and broccoli. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41567,&quot;Hungarian Mushroom Soup 1 pound butter, plus 2 pounds for roux 6 cups chopped yellow onions 10 pounds mushrooms 1 cup dill, chopped 1 cup paprika 2 cups tamari 2 gallon water 2 pounds butter 6 cups flour 1 gallon milk 1.75 gallons sour cream 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon pepper Instructions: Melt 1 pound of butter.

Place the almond paste and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the almond paste is softened and the sugar well-incorporated, about 5 minutes. Add the egg whites a little bit at a time, incorporating fully after each addition. Egg whites are difficult to pour in small amounts, so hold a rubber spatula against the rim of the bowl, and use it to \\cut\\ the egg whites as they are poured. If you add the egg whites all at once, the mixture will be lumpy, because the difference in consistency between the egg whites and the almond paste mixture is too great. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. You may or may not need all of the egg whites depending on the moistness and age of the almond paste. Stop mixing when the mixture reaches a consistency soft enough to pipe (similar to toothpaste). Place the batter in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 1-inch mounds onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. It will be easier if you hold the pastry bag at a slight angle and allow the tip to touch the parchment as you start to pipe. Once you have formed the mound, stop squeezing and lift the tip straight up, leaving a small tail on the top of each mound. Space the macaroons about 1-inch apart to allow for spreading and pipe carefully. The macaroons will look nicest when sandwiched together if they are all the same size. Immediately before placing them in the oven, liberally sprinkle granulated sugar over the macaroons. This will give them a nice crust that will keep the inside moist and chewy. Bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. The top of each macaroon should be very finely cracked, a characteristic for which they are known. If over-baked, the macaroons will be dry and crunchy. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and immediately pour the water onto the sheet pan under the parchment paper. Be careful! If you get any water on the macaroons, they will be soggy. You will need to tilt the baking sheet to spread the water evenly. Let it sit for 2 minutes. The water will loosen the macaroons from the paper. Remove the macaroons from the paper two at a time and stick them together, matching the flat sides. Do not put them back on the hot, wet baking sheet or they will become soggy. The macaroons can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days or well wrapped in the freezer for up to one week. Unwrap them before bringing back to room temperature, or the condensation will make them soggy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 41575,&quot;Banana Fritters with Spiced Glaze 3 eggs, beaten 3/4 cup milk 1/4 cup brown sugar 3 cups baking mix 3 ripe bananas, diced 2 cups canola oil, for frying 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice Instructions: For the fritters: In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk and sugar until blended. Stir in the baking mix and bananas until just combined. Heat the canola oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Using a small ice cream scoop, drop the batter into the skillet. Fry in batches until golden brown and cooked through the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the oil and allow to drain on a wire cooling rack set over a baking sheet. For the glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar, 1/4 cup water and pumpkin pie spice. While the fritters are still warm, pour the glaze over top.

Put the rice in a small pot with 2 cups of water and let it soak for 30 minutes. Pit the black olives and cut into small pieces. Stir the rice well and place over high heat. Let it come to a boil, then stir well again and turn the heat down to the lowest possible setting. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let simmer for 11 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, still covered, for 5 minutes more. Transfer the rice to a bowl, stir well and let cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped olives, olive oil, and orange zest. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Press the rice in a rice mold or shape by hand, and serve. Japanese rice is very sticky. To keep the rice from sticking to the rice mold, keep both pieces of the mold in water. Fill the mold 2/3 full with rice and press down with the top part firmly enough for the rice to stick together, but not so firmly that the rice gets mashed. Release the rice from the mold and put on a plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 41577,&quot;Chocolate Sponge Puddings Vegetable cooking spray 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 2 eggs, separated 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa 2 tablespoons flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons sour cream 1 teaspoon brown sugar Orange zest, for garnish, optional Special Equipment: 4 (4 to 6-ounce) ramekins Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray the insides of the ramekins with cooking spray. Distribute 1 tablespoon sugar among the 4 ramekins to coat. In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks and remaining 1/3 cup sugar with a handheld mixer until the yolks are pale yellow and the sugar dissolves. In a small bowl, combine the cocoa, flour, and salt. In another small bowl, combine the vanilla and milk. Add half the cocoa mixture to the eggs followed by half the milk mixture, beat until smooth, and then add the remaining cocoa and milk mixtures. In a small, clean bowl with clean beaters, whip the egg whites until stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture until incorporated. Be careful to not mix the air out of the egg whites. Divide among the ramekins. Place the ramekins in baking pan and carefully fill the pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins.

Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the meat in batches and remove to a plate, adding a little additional oil when necessary. When all of the meat is browned and set aside, add the butter to the Dutch oven to melt. When the butter foams, add the celery, carrots, onions, bay leaf, herb bundle, some salt and pepper and the caraway seeds. Stir to combine and sweat the vegetables for a few minutes. Add the cider and vinegar, and reduce by half. Add the stock and then return the pork to the Dutch oven. Cover and cook about 1 hour over low heat or in an oven preheated to 325 degrees F. Stir in the potatoes and apples and continue to cook until the pork is tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal. Reheat over moderate heat and garnish with celery tops to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 41588,&quot;Mystery of the Orient 3 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered 16 ounces white chocolate, tempered Cocoa butter Powdered food coloring, as desired Vegetable oil, for glazing Modeling chocolate Cornstarch, for rolling Instructions: Make the base: Use flexible aluminum strips or large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 10-inches in diameter. Place the ring on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. Make a support pole: Roll a piece of acetate into a tube that is 14 inches long and 2 1/2 inches in diameter and tape it closed. Set the tube on end and fill with dark chocolate. When it is full, invert the tube over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the tube to be quite sturdy, as the rest of the centerpiece will depend on it. Allow the chocolate tube to set until hard. Remove the acetate. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the tube so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it. Make the disks: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Set a 6-inch cake circle on top of the chocolate and trace around it with a sharp paring knife. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate and set the disk aside. Repeat 2 more times to make an 8-inch circle and a 10-inch circle. To paint the 6-inch chocolate disk, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the Japanese characters on the disk. Set aside. Use the same method to paint the 8-inch disk red. When the paint has dried, you can glaze it with any kind of vegetable oil. Make the face piece. Roll out the modeling chocolate to a 20-inch diameter circle. Use cornstarch to keep the modeling chocolate from sticking to the rolling pin or the work surface. Place the face mold on a flat surface in front of you. Carefully gather the modeling chocolate and place it over the face mold pressing it into the mold. Gather the sides to give the rest of the piece more character. The finished size should be 14 inches across and 16 inches from top to bottom. You can place the flexible modeling chocolate in the refrigerator. It will keep its shape better when it is cold. Use tempered dark chocolate to adhere the face piece to the 10-inch in circle. This will give the piece extra support so it can be glued to the support pole. Adhere this piece to the pole using more tempered chocolate. Make the fan: The fan has 9 spokes. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a straight edge to cut 9 strips of dark chocolate that are each 8 inches long and 3/8-inch wide. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Arrange the fan pieces so they spread evenly across an 8-inch wide space. You may need to adjust this measurement to fit the bottom of the fan you make. Glue the spokes together toward 1 end. If necessary, use a hot knife to trim the ends of the chocolate. Use modeling chocolate to make the face of the fan. Roll out the modeling chocolate so it is about 30 inches wide. Use a sharp paring knife to trace around the fan to get the shape. Carefully gather the modeling chocolate and place it over the fan using the fan to create the folds. My finished fan was about 24 inches across the top and 9 inches across the bottom. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Cut a curved piece of chocolate that is about 2 inches wide. This will serve as extra support for the fan. Paint the back of the fan with white chocolate. Use more tempered chocolate to glue the support piece to the back of the fan. Use more tempered chocolate to glue the spokes to the bottom of the fan. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired. If you use a paintbrush, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Apply color where you are inspired to do so. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the spokes to the back of the fan. Use more tempered chocolate to adhere the fan to the support. Adhere the painted disks to the support.

Bring to a boil, then pour into a large bowl. Add 1 cup of cold water and set brine aside to cool completely. Add shrimp and refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br> For the salad: Strip the peel from half of 1 of the grapefruits with a vegetable peeler, taking care not to include the bitter white pith. Warm the grapefruit peel, sliced ginger, and olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. As soon as the oil starts to bubble, about 2 minutes, remove from heat. Set oil aside to steep 30 minutes. Strain and reserve the oil.<br> Prepare an outdoor grill with a medium fire.<br> Segment both grapefruit over a bowl, reserving the juice (see page 000). Whisk 3 tablespoons of the reserved grapefruit juice with the vinegar, soy sauce, honey, and 12 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in the infused grapefruit oil, starting with a few drops and then adding the rest of the oil in a steady stream to make a slightly thick dressing. Season with black pepper to taste.<br> Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry. Brush shrimp with olive oil and grill, turning once, until shrimp are pink and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Gently toss the shrimp, grapefruit segments, lettuce, basil, and 12 teaspoon serrano with 14 cup of the dressing. Gently toss in avocados and divide the salad among 4 plates. Sprinkle with the remaining serrano, if desired, and drizzle with a little more of the dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 41592,&quot;Smoked Beef Ribs 1 4-pound rack beef ribs (about 8 ribs) 6 to 8 dried guajillo chiles 1/4 cup minced fresh rosemary 1/4 cup minced garlic Kosher salt 1/4 cup peanut oil Instructions: Prep the ribs: Put the ribs meaty-side down on a cutting board. Starting at one end, slide a chef&#39;s knife under the membrane that covers the back of the rack and make a cut in the membrane. Loosen the membrane with the knife, then grab it and pull it off. (The ribs will still be covered by a thin membrane-leave this; it holds the ribs together.) Make the rub: Slit each cl open lengthwise. Shake out the seeds and remove the stems and inner membranes. Tear the chiles into small pieces and grind in a spice or coffee grinder until powdery. Combine the rosemary, garlic and 1/4 cup each ground chiles and salt in a bowl. Mix in the peanut oil. Marinate the ribs: Rub the back of the rib rack with about one-quarter of the spice mixture. Rub the rest on the meaty side. Refrigerate at least 3 hours or preferably overnight. Prepare the grill: Stuff newspaper in the bottom of a chimney starter. Put it on the grill grate and fill with equal parts mesquite charcoal briquettes and mesquite wood chunks. Light the newspaper through the holes in the chimney. The charcoal and wood chunks will ignite. Allow the flames to die down and the coals to ash over. Remove the grill grate and dump the coals out of the chimney into the bottom of the grill, banking them to one side to create an indirect heat zone on the other side. Replace the grate. Smoke the ribs: Lay the ribs, meaty side up, on a sheet of heavy-duty foil over the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat). If there&#39;s space between your grill grates, use an extra-long piece of foil and let it hang down to the bottom of the grill, alongside the coals (as shown); this will help direct the smoke up toward the meat. Cover the grill and smoke until tender, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 2 hours, 30 minutes, turning every 20 minutes. You&#39;ll need to feed the fire about every 45 minutes: Lift the grate and add about a half chimney&#39;s worth of unlit briquettes and wood chunks to the hot coals. Carve the ribs: Transfer the rib rack to a cutting board. Slice into individual ribs and serve immediately.

Lightly dust a clean surface with flour. Make the crust: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor to combine. Add the butter and shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Gradually add 1/2 to 2/3 cup ice water, pulsing until the dough just comes together; scrape down the sides of the food processor as needed. Put the dough on the floured surface and roll it into a ball. Cut the dough in half; roll out 1 piece into a 13-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Gently roll up the dough onto the floured rolling pin and unroll into the pie plate. Press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan; refrigerate until ready to use. Roll out the second half of the dough into a 13-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Lay it on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate. Make the filling: Combine 3 cups blueberries and 1/2 cup sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then cook until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl; add the remaining 3 cups blueberries and 1/2 cup sugar, the jam, flour, lemon zest, lemon juice and salt. Stir to combine and set aside to cool completely. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spoon the filling into the crust-lined pie pan. Dot with the butter. Roll up the chilled dough on the floured rolling pin and unroll it over the blueberry filling. Trim the overlapping edge to about a 1 1/2-inch overhang. Tuck the edge of the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust. Pinch the edge to flute and seal. Use a pastry cutter or small knife to cut a 1-inch hole in the center of the top crust. Put the pie on a baking sheet. Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake 30 more minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Combine the sugar, orange juice and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer gently until the glaze coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Open the oven door and slide the rack out slightly. Pour the glaze over the pie and into the opening in the top crust. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 10 or 15 more minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool overnight before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41597,&quot;Minestrone with Crisp Parmesan Crumbs 1 pound borlotti beans 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1/2 cup divided, plus more for garnish 1/2 pound pancetta, finely chopped 2 medium onion, finely chopped 4 stalks celery, finely chopped 4 carrots, finely chopped 4 parsnips, finely chopped 3 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves 6 fresh sage leaves, chopped 2 bay leaves 2 (28-ounce) cans whole, peeled tomatoes, drained and hand crushed 6 quarts chicken stock 3 cups fresh white bread crumbs 1 cup grated Parmesan Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Soak the beans: Put the beans in a large pot and cover them with water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook the beans for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 1 hour. (Or cover the beans with cold water and let them soak overnight.) Start the soup: In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add 3 tablespoons olive oil. When the oil is hot add the pancetta, onion, celery, carrots, and parsnips and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons thyme, 2 tablespoons rosemary, the sage, and bay leaves. Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the tomatoes and 1/4 cup olive oil. Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, adding water if you need more liquid. The soup should be thick: to thicken the soup, break up some of the beans with the back of a spoon. Remove the bay leaves and discard before serving. Toast the bread crumbs: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the bread crumbs, remaining thyme and rosemary, and cheese on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over about 1/4 cup olive oil; combine well. Bake until the crumbs are golden brown and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. To serve, ladle the soup into small glasses, cups or mugs. Drizzle on a little olive oil, top with the crispy crumbs, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 41598,&quot;Leeks with Dijon Vinaigrette 6 medium leeks, dark green tops trimmed 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon water 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional for salting water 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 to 2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves, optional Instructions: Game Plan: Make the vinaigrette while the leeks cook. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, then salt it generously. Trim the root end of the leeks, leaving enough to hold the leaves together, and halve lengthwise. Rinse very well under running water to flush out any grit trapped between the leaves. Add the leeks to the boiling water and cook until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the leeks to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Pat dry and lay them on a serving platter. Meanwhile, whisk the vinegar, mustard, water, and the 3/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in the olive oil, starting with a few drops and then adding the rest in a steady stream to make a smooth, slightly thick dressing. Drizzle the vinaigrette evenly over leeks, turn them to coat, and scatter the parsley and the tarragon, if using, over the top. Serve immediately or up to 2 hours later at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 41599,&quot;Sauteed Chicken Breast with Whole Grain Mustard and Sage 4 boneless chicken breast halves, with skin (about 1 1/4 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Flour, for dredging 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 to 4 tablespoons unsalted butter optional 1/2 cup white wine or dry white vermouth 1 1/2 cups white or brown chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned 8 medium whole fresh sage leaves, plus more for garnish 1 1/2 tablespoons whole grain mustard Instructions: Preheat a large skillet over medium-heat, for about 1 minute or until the surface of the pan is uniformly hot. While the pan heats pat the chicken dry, and season the skin-side with salt and pepper. Spread flour onto a plate and lightly dredge the chicken in the flour to coat. Shake off the excess flour. Add the oil to the pan. Lay the chicken skin side down into the pan and saute over high heat for 1 minute. Lower the heat to medium-high and cook the chicken until browned, about 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan. Turn the breasts over and cook for another 5 to 8 minutes, or until firm to the touch. Remove chicken from the pan to a plate and keep warm while you make the sauce. Add the white wine or the vermouth to the pan, and with a wooden spoon, scrape up the browned bits that have collected on the pan. (This is called deglazing the pan.) Cook the wine until syrupy over high heat, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth, the sage, and reduce the sauce by 1/4 or until thickened. Off the heat, whisk in 1 to 3 tablespoons butter and the mustard, to enrich, flavor, and thicken the sauce. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce onto a serving platter or divide among 4 plates, put chicken on the sauce, and serve.

Beat in the mayonnaise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 41603,&quot;Korean-Inspired Corn Dogs with Boom Boom Sauce Canola oil, for deep-frying 6 all-beef hot dogs (each about 5 inches long) 1/3 cup milk 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1 large egg 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup sweet rice flour (glutinous rice flour) 1 teaspoon baking powder Pinch kosher salt 2 cups panko breadcrumbs 12 ounces frozen crinkle-cut sweet potato fries, diced (about 3 cups), optional 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, optional, for sprinkling Boom Boom Sauce, recipe follows, for serving Ketchup or yellow mustard, optional, for serving 1 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup sweet chili sauce 1/4 cup sriracha 1 teaspoon garlic salt Instructions: Fill a large Dutch oven halfway with canola oil. Heat to 325 degrees F over medium heat. Place a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. While the oil is heating, halve the hot dogs crosswise and skewer each one lengthwise with a takeout chopstick, thick skewer or ice-pop stick. Arrange them in a single layer on a plate and place in the freezer until cold but not frozen, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix together the milk, brown sugar and egg in a large bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the all-purpose flour, rice flour, baking powder and salt and stir until combined and smooth. The batter should be thicker than a pancake batter, but you should be able to wrap it around the dogs easily. Add another tablespoon or two of water if the mixture gets too thick. Place the panko and sweet potato fries, if using, in separate wide shallow bowls or baking dishes. To make the regular dogs (without the sweet potatoes), dip the hot dogs one at a time in the batter, making sure the entire dog is coated. Roll the battered dog in the panko, then drop it in the hot oil. You can fry 4 to 5 at a time. Fry until deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon to the rack-lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the oven to keep the dogs warm and repeat with the remaining hot dogs, allowing the oil to return to 325 degrees F before frying the next batch. Or, to make the sweet potato dogs, dip the hot dogs one at a time in the batter, then roll in the sweet potato mixture, firmly pressing on any loose potatoes. Fry until the potatoes and batter are deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon to the rack-lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the oven to keep the dogs warm and repeat with the remaining hot dogs, allowing the oil to return to 325 degrees F before frying the next batch. When ready to serve, sprinkle with the granulated sugar if desired and drizzle with the Boom Boom Sauce and ketchup or mustard, if using. Serve warm. Mix the mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, sriracha and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Transfer into a squeeze bottle (if desired). Refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41604,&quot;Roast Chicken Breast with Zibibbo Raisins and Pearl Couscous 4 (12-ounce) chicken breasts Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 ounces olive oil 1/4 cup fennel bulb, 1/4-inch dice 1 sprig sage 1 lemon, zested 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 cup white wine 1/2 cup sweet wine, preferably Passito or Moscato de Pantelleria 1/2 cup Zibibbo raisins, if available 1 cup Brown Chicken Stock, recipe follows 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 ounces butter 1 cup sweet seedless grapes, halved 8 crisp fried sage leaves 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup chopped onions 1 cup pearl couscous 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups chicken stock, hot 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon minced parsley leaves 5 to 6 pounds chicken bones, including necks and feet, coarsely chopped 1 medium onion, peeled, trimmed, and thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To prepare the chicken: Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a saute pan, heat olive oil and sear skin side down until golden in color, about 3 minutes. Turn and saute another 3 minutes. Transfer pan to oven and roast for 15 to 20 minutes or until done. Remove the chicken from the pan and keep warm. Remove fat from pan. Add fennel, sage sprig, lemon zest, lemon juice, and raisins and deglaze with 1 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup sweet wine. Over high heat, reduce by half. Add brown chicken stock and cream. Reduce until slightly thickened. Remove sage and finish sauce with butter and grapes. To prepare the couscous: In a saucepan, heat olive oil. Add onions and cook for 1 minute, until glossy (do not brown). Add pearl couscous and stir until well coated with oil. Season with salt and add 1 cup of chicken stock. Stir occasionally until 2/3 of the liquid is absorbed. Add the remaining cup of stock, and continue to cook until al dente. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, stir in butter, and finish with parsley. Set aside and keep warm. To serve: Place a few tablespoons of couscous in the center of a plate. Slice each chicken breast diagonally into 2 pieces. Arrange on top of couscous. Nap with sauce and sprinkle with sage leaves. Serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread the bones and onion slices in a roasting pan and set in the oven. Turn the bones to brown all sides until they are a deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. Do not allow them to burn, since that will give the stock a bitter taste. Transfer the bones and onion to a stockpot, and place the roasting pan on the stove. Over medium high heat, deglaze the pan with 2 cups of water, scraping up all the bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Pour into the stockpot and add 3 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 3 hours. Strain into a clean stockpot and boil for 20 to 30 minutes, until the stock is reduced to 2 cups. At this point, the stock is more concentrated and more flavorful. Strain into a clean bowl and cool. Since brown stock is primarily a base for sauces and only a small amount is used, pour the cooled stock into an ice-cube tray. When completely solid, release the cubes, enclose in a plastic bag, and return to the freezer. When needed, one or two cubes can be defrosted and used in a recipe.

Coat two 8-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk the cocoa powder and 1 1/2 cups boiling water in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, sour cream and vanilla and beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the cocoa mixture in a steady stream until just combined, then finish mixing with a rubber spatula. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and tap the pans against the counter to help the batter settle. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level. For the ganache: Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the heavy cream and corn syrup to a simmer in a small saucepan. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let stand 5 minutes, then stir until completely smooth. Let the ganache sit until it has cooled and thickened to a spreadable consistency, 20 to 30 minutes. Place 1 cake layer on a cardboard cake circle on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to catch any drips. Spread about 1/2 cup of the ganache on top and place the second cake layer cut-side down over the ganache. Dollop half of the remaining ganache on top and spread with a large offset spatula so the ganache covers the top of the cake and slowly runs down the sides. Repeat with the remaining ganache, using the offset spatula to make a smooth, even layer over the surface and around the sides of the cake. Refrigerate until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. To decorate: Melt the white chocolate chips in a small microwave-safe bowl in the microwave in 15 second intervals on 50 percent power until melted, stirring after each interval. Let sit 5 minutes, then transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a medium plain tip. (Alternatively, transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner.) Pipe a straight line through the center of the cake from top to bottom, then another line through the center from left to right, dividing the cake into quarters. Pipe 2 more lines to divide the cake into eighths. Pipe a circle of white chocolate around the edge of the cake. Pipe a small circle where the points intersect in the center of the cake. Place a candy-coated chocolate near the tip of each point for reindeer noses (one of them will be red). Add 2 reindeer eyes above each nose. Stick 2 pretzel twist pieces above each pair of eyes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 41618,&quot;Hot and Sour Soup 6 1/2 cups chicken stock 1 heaping tablespoon tom yam hot and sour paste 4 kaffir lime leaves, finely chopped, optional 1 stalk lemongrass, bottom, inner part only, roughly chopped 1 lime, juiced 4 tablespoons fish sauce (nam pla) 2 to 3 small jalapenos or fresh red or green chiles, finely chopped 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons, straw or button mushrooms, halved or quartered 1 pound (2 ounces) peeled, raw shrimp Five 1-inch pieces small scallions, sliced thin 1 bunch cilantro, leaves chopped Instructions: In a medium saucepan, heat chicken stock, tom yam paste, lime leaves, lemon grass, lime juice, fish sauce, chiles, and sugar.

Spray a 10-inch cake pan with vegetable cooking spray. Line the bottom of the pan with a 10-inch parchment paper circle. Spray the top of the parchment paper circle with vegetable cooking spray. Place both chopped chocolates in a bowl and melt over a double boiler. Combine the sugar and water in a 1-quart saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil until all of the sugar is dissolved. Pour the hot syrup into the bowl of melted chocolate. Whisk until the mixture is homogenous. Add the butter and whisk until well mixed. Use an electric mixer to beat the eggs and sugar until well blended. Use a rubber spatula to fold this mixture into the chocolate mixture. Be careful to mix gently. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Place a baking sheet with one-inch sides in the oven. Place the filled cake pan on the baking sheet. Fill the baking sheet with water so the water covers the bottom inch of the cake pan. Bake until the cake surface appears dull and taut when pressed in the middle, about 40 minutes. Remove the cake pan from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack. Turn off the oven and let the baking sheet and water cool before you attempt to remove them. TEMPERING CHOCOLATE: Tempering is important because it determines the final gloss, hardness, and contraction of the chocolate. Those factors are evidence that the cocoa butter in the chocolate has been correctly crystallized. Chocolate is purchased in its tempered form. It snaps when you break it, usually has a nice shine to it and it is hard. In order to use it, you need to melt it. When you melt chocolate, the molecules of fat separate and you lose the temper (crystallization). If you want to use the chocolate for molding or coating, it needs to be tempered. Tempering chocolate means putting the molecules of fat back together. There are a variety of ways to do it. One of the easiest ways to temper it is to place the chocolate in a glass bowl and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. Keep an eye on it; the chocolate will not look like it has melted because it retains its shape. The chocolate should be only slightly warmer than your bottom lip. You may still see lumps in it but, don&#39;t worry; the residual heat of the chocolate will melt them. You can also use an immersion blender to break up the lumps and start the recrystallization process. Usually, the chocolate begins to set (recrystallize) along the side of the bowl. As it begins to crystallize, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate and they will begin the recrystallization process. I like to use a glass bowl because it retains the heat and keeps the chocolate tempered a long time. Here is another easy way to temper chocolate. In this method, tempering is achieved by adding small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually one fourth of the total amount. I use an immersion blender to mix the 2 together. The classic way to temper chocolate is call tabliering. Chocolate is melted over a hot water bath to a temperature between 88 and 90 F (31 to 34 C). White and milk chocolate are melted to a temperature approximately 2 F less, depending on the amount of milk fat they contain. 2/3 of the melted chocolate is poured on a cold table or marble surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until the temperature of the chocolate is approximately 81 F (27 C). At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining one third of non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass in the bowl has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is further worked on the cold table until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room and makes a big mess. Here is a tip: Temper more chocolate than you need. A larger quantity will hold its temper longer than a smaller quantity (just like a large cup of coffee will stay hot longer than a small cup of espresso). You can always reuse the extra chocolate. Most people have trouble tempering because they use too small of an amount. Don&#39;t forget to use a glass bowl. A simple method of checking tempering is by applying a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within 5 minutes. Remember, just like everything else in life, practice makes perfect. If your chocolate does not temper the first time, you can still eat it! Now that is an incentive! &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 41636,&quot;Ham and Brie Pull-Apart Sandwiches 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 18-inch baguette 6 ounces deli-sliced ham<br> 4 ounces brie cheese, cut into 6 slices 6 cornichons, sliced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425? F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the butter and mustard in a bowl and mash with a spoon; season with salt and pepper. Trim the ends off the baguette. Cut the bread on an angle into 12 slices, leaving the bottom of the loaf intact. (You can position chopsticks along the long sides of the bread to keep from cutting all the way through the loaf.) Transfer to the baking sheet. Brush all but 2 tablespoons of the mustard butter between the bread slices. Fold each piece of ham in half or into quarters, then stuff into every other slice in the bread, starting with the first slice. Stuff a slice of brie into each piece of ham.

Toss in the onion, season with salt and bring to medium heat. Cook the onion until soft and very aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes. Toss in the garlic, jalapeno and chorizo and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more, breaking up the meat with a spoon. Add the chopped cilantro, chipotles, adobo sauce and tomatoes. Season with salt, taste and season again if needed. Stir in 1 cup water, increase the heat to high, bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the mixture has a good saucy consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. While the sauce cooks, fill a large saucepan with about 3 inches of canola oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to about 375 degrees F (or add a slice of tortilla to the oil -- when it sizzles, starts to float and crisps up, it&#39;s ready). While the oil heats up, put a couple of paper towels on a baking sheet next to the stove. When the oil is hot, work in batches to fry the tortillas until they are crispy chips. Remove the chips from the oil, drain on the paper towels and sprinkle with salt.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss a third of the chips with a third each of the tomato sauce and cheeses. Spread the chip mixture in the bottom of a large ovenproof casserole dish, then top with another third of the chips, sauce and cheeses. Repeat the process with the remaining chips, sauce and cheeses. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.<br> When the casserole comes out of the oven, coat a large saute pan lightly with olive oil. Add the eggs (you will probably have to work in batches to fry all of them -- no worries) and bring the pan to medium heat. Cook the eggs until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are warm and runny, about 4 minutes. Place the fried eggs on top of the chips. Sprinkle with the whole cilantro leaves. Serve with the lime wedges and crema. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 41644,&quot;Banana Bread Lava Cake 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup mashed banana (from about 2 bananas)<br> 1/4 cup sour cream 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 chocolate-coated vanilla ice cream bars, such as Klondike Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add chicken pieces and poach, covered, over low heat for about 35 to 45 minutes, until cooked through and juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Remove the meat from the stock. Strain and reserve the stock. Heat 2 quarts of water in a kettle. On a 10-inch dry comal, griddle, or in a cast-iron frying pan, toast the chiles over medium heat until blackened, but not burnt, about 10 minutes. Place the chiles in a large bowl, cover with hot water, and soak for 1/2 hour. Remove the chiles from the soaking water with tongs, placing small batches in a blender with 1/4 cup of the cl soaking water to blend smooth. Put the cl puree through a strainer to remove the skins. In the same dry comal, griddle, or frying pan, grill the onion and garlic over medium heat for 10 minutes. Set aside. Toast the almonds, peanuts, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in a dry comal, griddle or cast-iron frying pan for about 5 minutes. Remove them from the pan. Over the same heat, toast the cl seeds, taking care to blacken but not burn them, about 20 minutes. Try to do this outside or in a well-ventilated place because the seeds will give off very strong fumes. When the seeds are completely black, light them with a match and let them burn themselves out. Remove from the heat and place in a bowl. Soak the blackened seeds in 1 cup of cold water for 10 minutes. Drain the seeds and grind them in a blender for about 2 minutes. Add the blended cl seeds to the blended cl mixture. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in an 8-inch cast-iron frying pan over medium heat until smoking. Add the raisins and fry them until they are plump, approximately 1 minute. Remove from the pan. Fry the bread slice in the same oil until browned, about 5 minutes, over medium heat. Remove from pan. Fry the plantain in the same oil until it is well browned, approximately 10 minutes, over medium heat. Set aside. Fry the sesame seeds, stirring constantly over low heat, adding more oil if needed. When the sesame seeds start to brown, about 5 minutes, add the pecans and brown for 2 minutes more. Remove all from the pan, let cool, and grind finely in a spice grinder. It takes a bit of time, but this is the only way to grind the seeds and nuts finely enough. Wipe out the frying pan and fry the tomatoes, tomatillos, thyme, and oregano over medium to high heat, allowing the juices to almost evaporate, about 15 minutes. Blend well, using 1/2 cup of reserved stock if needed to blend and set aside. Place the nuts, bread, plantains, raisins, onion, garlic and spices in the blender in small batches, and blend well, adding about 1 cup of stock to make it smooth. In a heavy 4-quart stockpot, heat 2 tablespoons of lard or oil until smoking and fry the cl paste over medium to low heat, stirring constantly so it will not burn, approximately 20 minutes. When it is dry, add the tomato puree and fry until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add the ground ingredients, including the sesame seed paste, to the pot. Stir constantly with a wooden soon until well-incorporated, about 10 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken stock to the mole, stir well, and allow to cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Break up the chocolate and add to the pot, stirring until it is melted and incorporated into the mixture. Toast the avocado leaf briefly over the flame if you have a gas range or in a dry frying pan and then add it to the pot. Slowly add more stock to the mole, as it will keep thickening as it cooks. Add enough salt to bring out the flavor. Let simmer another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally so it does not stick, adding stock as needed. The mole should not be thick; just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Place the cooked chicken pieces in the leftover stock in a saucepan and heat through. To serve, place a piece of chicken in a shallow bowl and ladle 3/4 of a cup of mole sauce over to cover it completely. Serve immediately with lots of hot corn tortillas. You can use oil instead of lard to fry the mole, but the flavor will change dramatically. In our pueblo, people traditionally use turkey instead of chicken, and sometimes add pieces of pork and beef to enhance the flavor. You can use leftover mole and chicken meat to make Enmoladas or Tamales Oazaquenos made with banana leaves.

Melt the butter in a saute pan over medium heat, add the shrimp and garlic and saute until the shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes. Toss the shrimp with the chopped parsley. Set aside to cool and then chop the shrimp. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and stretch and press with your hands to form a thin, rectangular shape. If you need to, pick up the dough and let the natural weight of the dough stretch itself out. It doesn&#39;t need to be perfect, matter of fact its better when it&#39;s not. Once you have the dough in the shape you like, brush one side of the dough with olive oil and lay that side down flat onto the preheated grill. Cook the dough until it is charred and has a crisp texture, about 5 minutes, brush the other side with some oil and then flip the dough and char the second side. Once the bread is charred and cooked, remove it from the grill and assemble the flatbread. Spread the ricotta onto the flatbread and sprinkle the oregano over the entire surface. Top with the artichokes, red peppers and shrimp and sprinkle the entire thing with lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Serve and enjoy! In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you&#39;d like! Cook&#39;s Notes: This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water. Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don&#39;t need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 41649,&quot;Creamy Homemade Hummus 1 cup dried chickpeas 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1/2 cup tahini<br> 2 cloves garlic, optional<br> 1/4 cup cold water<br> Olive oil, for serving<br> Finely chopped onion (for topping) or onion wedges (for dipping)<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for serving Fresh pita, for serving Instructions: In a medium bowl, cover the chickpeas with enough water to reach 2 inches above the height of the chickpeas and soak them for 12 hours. Drain and rinse the chickpeas and place them in a large saucepan with the baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Cover them with 1 to 2 inches water and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and simmer until the chickpeas are very soft, about 2 hours. Drain them, let them cool slightly and then transfer to a food processor. Add the lemon juice, tahini, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the garlic, if using, and blend until very smooth, about 1 minute. With the motor running, drizzle in the water and continue to blend for 1 more minute. Taste and add additional salt to taste. Transfer to a serving dish and top with a drizzle of olive oil and some chopped onion and parsley. Serve with fresh pita and onion wedges and enjoy. Any leftovers should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge with a thin layer of olive oil coating the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41650,&quot;\\No Nightmare\\ Beef Wellington 6 preformed frozen puff pastry cups 2 tablespoons canola oil Six 4-ounce beef fillets Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Duxelles, recipe follows Spinach, recipe follows Wine Sauce, recipe follows 1 1/2 pounds sliced button mushrooms 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Salt 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme leaves 1/4 cup liver pate Kosher salt and cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 bags pre-washed baby spinach Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 cup balsamic vinegar 1 cup red wine 1/2 cup sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lay the puff cups on a baking sheet making sure the cups are not touching each other by at least an inch on all sides. Bake per packaging instructions. Heat a large oven safe skillet over high heat, add the oil. With paper towels remove all excess moisture from the outside of the beef, season the beef liberally with salt and pepper on all sides. When the oil begins to smoke, lay the beef fillets gently in pan, making sure the fillets are not touching. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, then put the pan in the oven and cook for an additional 10 minutes for medium rare. Cut the puff cup in half and place the bottom half in the center of the serving plate lay a spoonful of Spinach in the middle of the puff, top the Spinach with of the fillets. Lay a spoonful of Duxelles on top of the fillet and cap it off with the top of the puff pastry. Drizzle the plate with a tablespoon of the Wine Sauce. Add the mushrooms to a food processor and pulse until they are extra-finely chopped. Heat the butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Once the butter has melted add the mushrooms and large pinch of salt, continue to cook the mixture, stirring often until the most of the mushroom moisture has evaporated. Add the thyme and melt in liver pate. Check for seasoning. In a large pan heat the butter over medium heat, once the butter has melted add the spinach and a pinch of salt, cook until the leaves have wilted. In a medium sauce pot, over high heat, add all the sauce ingredients.

Assemble all of your topping ingredients on a big platter. Lightly oil a sheet pan and roll and stretch one ball of dough until it is approximately 12-inches in length and 8-inches across. It is not necessary to make a perfect circle, but the dough should be an even thickness of 1/8-inch. Carefully stretch the dough onto the hot side of the grill and cook until the dough puffs on top, crisps on the bottom, and grill marks appear, about 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the dough onto the cool side of the grill and brush the cooked side with olive oil. Quickly and sparingly assemble the toppings of your choice, such as tomato puree, fontina, and prosciutto di Parma, capers, and red peppers; or tomato puree, pecorino Romano, bel paese, grilled jumbo shrimp, and jarred Italian eggplant. Garnish with torn basil leaves. Feel free to improvise the toppings and come up with your own. Once the pizza has been dressed, season it with salt and pepper, to taste, drag it over to the hot side of the grill, and cook until the ingredients are heated through. (If the pizza browns too quickly, pull it to the cool side and cover the grill to finish cooking.) Using a wide spatula or two pairs of tongs, carefully lift the pizza onto a cutting board and divide into 6 or 8 pieces. Serve right away. Repeat with the remaining dough. In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and molasses and stir gently to mix. Set aside for five minutes until bubbly and foamy. Add the salt, to taste, and oil and stir to mix. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flours. Add the flours to the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Divide the dough into six equal pieces. Roll into balls and place on an oiled baking pan. Brush the balls with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place for 20 minutes. When the grill is ready, oil a second baking sheet and flatten one ball of dough into a 10 to 12-inch piece about 1/8-inch thick. A perfect circle is less crucial than even thickness. Cook&#39;s Note: Dough can be held for 1 day in the refrigerator. Let sit 1 hour at room temperature before grilling. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 41652,&quot;Mashed Potatoes 2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4 medium), whole, scrubbed 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed 1/4 cup unsalted butter 3/4 cup whole milk Freshly grated nutmeg (optional) Freshly ground black or white pepper Instructions: In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, and enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Do not cover. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until fork tender, about 45 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pan. Swirl the pan over medium heat until the skins are dry, about 1 minute. Halve the potatoes crosswise. Put the halves in a ricer cut-side down and press the potato through the ricer into a bowl. The flesh should easily pass through the holes and the skins remain in the ricer. Discard the skin, and repeat with the remaining potatoes. (Alternatively, peel the cooked potatoes and put through a food mill or mash with a hand-held potato masher.) Heat the butter and milk in the saucepan over medium-high heat until hot but not boiling.

Pulse until the shrimp are coarsely chopped. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the heavy cream, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper and pulse just to combine. Don&#39;t over-process the cream or you&#39;ll wind up with grainy textured cream or even butter. Remove the mixture to a bowl and add the chopped tarragon leaves, blending them in with a spatula. Lay out one wonton skin on a board. Using a pastry bag or a teaspoon, place approximately one teaspoon of the filling in its center. Brush a second wonton skin with the egg-water mixture and lay over the filling, pressing lightly with your fingers to remove any trapped air and seal the edges of the wonton skins. Continue to make ravioli in this manner until all the filling has been used. The uncooked ravioli should be stored refrigerated in a container, sprinkled lightly with cornstarch. They will keep up to two days in the refrigerator, or for several weeks in the freezer. To freeze, lay the ravioli in a single layer on a wax-paper lined sheet pan and place in a freezer until frozen. They can then be removed and stored in freezer bags. Heat the fish stock in a sauce pan and set aside. In another sauce pot heat the olive oil, add the chopped onions and cook until wilted. Add the crushed tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes before adding the fish stock and saffron. Continue to cook for 30 minutes until ready to serve. To cook the ravioli, drop them into boiling salted water and continue cooking at a boil until they begin to float (about two to three minutes for fresh ravioli, 5 to 6 minutes for frozen ones). Drain and divide among soup bowls. Add 1/2 cup saffron broth to each bowl, garnish with a little diced tomato and some chopped fresh herbs such as tarragon or chives.

Coat four 9-inch cake pans with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mixes; divide the batter among the pans and bake and cool as directed. Meanwhile, prepare the gelatin as directed. Level the domed tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife. Stack 3 of the cakes on a small cardboard circle with a thin layer of chocolate frosting between each cake. Freeze at least 30 minutes. Put the 3-layer cake on an upside-down cake pan (so trimming will be easier). Using a small serrated knife, trim the bottom edge of the cake to round it out, then round out the top edge. Frost the top. Set the remaining cake layer on top of the 3-layer cake; freeze at least 30 minutes. Trim around this layer at an angle, cutting inward so it resembles a shallow bowl. Cut and scoop out the center of the top cake layer, about 6 inches wide and 2 inches deep. Cover the inside of the hole with the white frosting. Dye the remaining chocolate frosting black. Cover the exposed cake with a thin layer of black frosting; freeze about 20 minutes, then cover with the remaining frosting (reserve about 1 tablespoon). Return the cake to the freezer. Once the gelatin is firm, stir until clumpy. Return to the refrigerator until ready to serve. Make the flames: Using a paring knife, cut the gummy fruit slices in half to make 2 thinner slices. Press a few pieces of different colors together with your fingers as shown. Repeat to make about 20 flames. Press the flames around the bottom of the cake. Cut off one-third of each doughnut. Using the reserved black frosting as glue, press the doughnuts into the sides of the cake for handles.

Add the tomatoes, onion and garlic, stir and cook for a minute or two to soften the onion. Add 2 teaspoons of the chili powder, 1 teaspoon of the paprika and 1 teaspoon of the cumin. Stir and cook the mixture for another minute or two to release the flavors of the spices. Remove the mixture to a bowl and set aside. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the chicken along with the remaining 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Saute the chicken until it&#39;s deep golden brown and done in the middle, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water and stir to make a sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook until it&#39;s reduced by half, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the beans and set aside. To assemble the casserole, pour half a jar (about 1 cup) of salsa verde into the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish or disposable foil baking pan. Add a layer of half the tortillas on top of the salsa verde, overlapping the edges. Spoon the rice over the tortillas, spread the tomato mixture over the rice, then sprinkle the corn over the tomatoes. Next, add the chicken and bean mixture, then sprinkle on half the cheese and pour over half the enchilada sauce. Next, add the rest of the tortillas, then pour on the rest of the salsa verde and the rest of the enchilada sauce and sprinkle on the rest of the cheese. If you&#39;re baking the casserole right away, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and bake, covered with foil, for 20 minutes. Then remove the foil and continue baking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Serve with sour cream and cilantro.

Add the onions, shallots, and garlic and cook until they are soft but not browned. Lower the heat and add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chopped mixed green and red peppers, parsley, wine, stock, and mushrooms. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add the carrots, zucchini, squash, and broccoli and cook until the vegetables are al dente. Add the mixed vegetables and spinach and heat through. Drain the vegetables and put them into an ice bath. When cool, drain well. Put the vegetables back into the pot along with the creamed corn. Mix in the red pepper flakes, paprika, oregano, Cajun seasoning, and salt and pepper, to taste. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Place 1/4 cup vegetable mixture on the middle of each empanada dough disk. Avoid reaching the edges with the filling because oiliness will prevent good sealing. Slightly wet the edges, fold in half, and stick edges together. The shape should resemble a half-moon. Seal by pinching the edge between your thumb and index finger to make a curl about 5 or 6 times. Other sealing procedures like pinching without curling or using a fork to seal will not prevent the juices from leaking. Place the finished empanadas on the cookie sheet and brush them with the egg yolk. Cook until they are golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41690,&quot;Herb Roasted Turkey Breast with Pan Gravy 1 small (golf-ball sized) onion, peeled and coarsely chopped 1 lemon, scrubbed clean 12 fresh sage leaves Large handful fresh flat-leaf parsley (about 1/2 cup, from 12 stems) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling pan 1 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed 6 fresh bay leaves 4 tablespoons butter 2 boneless turkey breast halves, skin on (about 2 to 2 1/2 pounds each) Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup apple or regular brandy (recommended: Calvados) 2 to 3 cups apple cider Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Oil a roasting pan and set it aside. Put the onion into the bowl of a mini food processor. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the zest from the lemon in thin strips, being careful not to cut into the bitter white pith. Add the lemon zest to the food processor and reserve the whole lemon for another use. Chop the onion and lemon zest until fine. Add the sage, parsley, olive oil, and 1 teaspoon salt and pulse until it forms a coarse paste. Put 2 of the bay leaves and the butter into a small pan and heat over medium-low heat until the butter is bubbling. Remove from the heat and set aside. Put the turkey breasts on a work surface. Carefully run your fingers between the skin and the flesh from 1 end, being careful not to pull it completely off, creating a pocket. Season the turkey breasts generously with salt and pepper. Stuff half of the herb paste under the skin of each breast, and spread it evenly under the skin. Transfer the breasts to the roasting pan, and slide 2 bay leaves underneath each one. (The heat of the pan will release the bay leaf oils and flavor the breast.) Using a pastry brush, baste the breasts with half of the bay butter. Place the turkey in the oven and immediately decrease the temperature to 400 degrees F. After 20 minutes, baste the turkey breasts with the remaining butter, and roast for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until cooked through, and a thermometer placed in the thickest part of the breast registers 170 degrees F. Remove from the oven, transfer to a platter, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes before carving while you make the gravy. Put the roasting pan over the burner on medium heat. Sprinkle the flour over the pan juices, and cook, stirring, for a few minutes. Add the apple brandy, and scrape the pan to lift the bits that are stuck to the bottom. Cook for a minute to burn off the alcohol, then, while stirring, pour in the apple cider. Bring to a simmer, and stir until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the turkey breast on the diagonal, and serve with warm gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 41691,&quot;Roasted Mushrooms with Pumpkin-Chipotle Polenta 2 pounds mixed mushroom caps, such as coarsely chopped hen of the woods or wood ears, coarsely chopped shiitakes, thinly sliced porcini, thinly sliced portabellas or criminis About 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 head garlic, cloves crushed Small handful sage, chopped or thinly sliced Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup cooked pumpkin puree 3 cups chicken stock Freshly grated nutmeg 1 chipotle in adobo, seeded and finely chopped, plus a small spoon of sauce 1 cup quick-cooking polenta 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons honey Toasted pepitas, for garnish Chives, chopped, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Toss the mushrooms with the extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, sage, salt, and pepper, and roast 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the pumpkin puree in a small pot over medium heat with a little chicken stock to thin it out. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Bring the remaining stock to a boil in a saucepot and whisk in the chipotle in adobo, its sauce, and polenta. Keep whisking the polenta until it pulls away from the sides of the pot, then stir in the butter and honey. Combine the pumpkin and polenta and serve in shallow bowls.

It is best to purchase the second half of the herbs when they are needed. If using pint jars for storage, you will need 3 jars. If using small wine bottles, each holds approximately 13 ounces; therefore, you will need 4 bottles. Put the water and bleach in a large container. Dunk 12 sprigs of tarragon and 12 chive shoots in the solution, and then rinse in cold water. Pat dry. Heat the vinegar in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, and heat until vinegar reaches 190 degrees F. Place the herbs in a container large enough to hold the vinegar. Pour the vinegar over the herbs, and after the vinegar has cooled, place the lid on the container. Set in a cool dark place for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, sanitize the second half of the herbs as previously, rinse, pat dry, and set aside. Sterilize the containers and lids that you will store the vinegar in by immersing them in a large pot of boiling water and boiling for 10 minutes. If using corks, purchase pre-sterilized corks, and then dip them in and out of boiling water 3 to 4 times. Discard the old herbs. Strain the vinegar through a sanitized colander or funnel lined with cheesecloth. Divide the fresh herbs among the containers and pour the vinegar over them. Seal and refrigerate. The vinegar may be stored at room temperature for 5 to 6 weeks or in the refrigerator for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41695,&quot;Hot German Potato Salad 2 pounds white-skinned waxy potatoes, scrubbed (about 5 large) Kosher salt 6 slices bacon (about 4 ounces) 1 small yellow onion, diced 3/4 cup chicken broth 1/3 cup fruity white wine (recommended: Riesling)<br> 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Freshly ground pepper Instructions:</p><ol><li>Put the potatoes in a large saucepan.

Stir in the parsley. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and add the salmon, cracker crumbs, mayonnaise, Dijon, salt, pepper, egg and lemon zest and juice. Mix with your hands until evenly combined. Shape into patties (I use 1/2 cup per patty, making 8). Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate for 20 minutes. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook the patties (do not overcrowd the pan -- I do 4 at a time) until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to cook the second batch. Transfer to a serving platter and serve with the tartar sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 41702,&quot;Fried Shrimp 1/2 cup cornstarch 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs<br> 1 1/2 pounds peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp, butterflied Vegetable oil, for shallow frying<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Cocktail Sauce, recipe follows 2 cups ketchup 2 heaping tablespoons prepared horseradish Instructions: Combine the cornstarch and flour in one bowl, then beat the eggs and 1/2 cup water in a second bowl.

In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the oil and heat to the verge of smoking. Add the pancetta, reduce the heat to medium, and cook the pancetta until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Once cooked, remove the pancetta with a slotted spoon to paper towels and reserve. Add the onions and garlic and cook until translucent, 6 to 7 minutes. Once the onions are cooked, remove from the pan and toss in a bowl with the lemon juice, crab boil seasoning, butter, and parsley. Top the clams with the onion-herb mixture, reserved pancetta, and Parmesan. Place on a baking sheet and bake until the cheese has melted, 10 to 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41704,&quot;Pecan Tart 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons sugar 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold butter 4 to 6 tablespoons ice cold water 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup corn syrup 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon butter, melted 1 cup chopped pecans 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 large Rome apples, cored, peeled and chopped 1 teaspoon lemon juice Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place flour in a medium bowl, add salt and sugar and mix well. Add butter and cut into flour, using a pastry cutter, until butter is the size of small peas. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing gently after each addition. Dough will begin to form a ball when enough water has been added. Gather dough with dry hands and form into an even ball. Let rest for 5 minutes. Roll pate brisee dough to a 12-inch circle. Place in a 9-inch tart pan and lightly press into pan. In a large bowl, combine sugar and corn syrup. Add eggs and beat until smooth. Add melted butter and continue to beat. Add pecans and vanilla and mix well. Set aside. In a small bowl mix apples with lemon juice.

Divide the pizza dough into 2 balls. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and press each ball out into a thin 10-inch round. Put the baking sheet on the preheated stone and parbake until the dough just starts to brown on the bottom and edges, about 10 minutes for a softer crust or about 15 minutes for a crisper crust. Remove and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, toss the onions and lime juice in a small bowl and let sit at room temperature until the onions turn pink and soften slightly, about 10 minutes. Strain. Divide the pizza sauce, Gouda, bacon and pineapple between the 2 pizza crusts. Bake on the preheated stone until the crust is golden brown and the Gouda melts, 8 to 10 minutes. Top with the pickled onions and cilantro. Cut each pizza into 4 slices and serve. Cover the potatoes with water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, about 25 minutes; remove. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the skin and work the potatoes through a ricer set over a large bowl (should have about 2 cups). Set aside. Stir together the warm water, agave and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Add the potatoes, rice flour, tapioca starch and 3/4 teaspoon salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until the mixture is combined and forms a fine, crumbly meal. Continuing to mix on medium, add the egg white and oil, slowly drizzle in the yeast mixture and mix until the dough comes together (it will be slightly tacky). Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough increases by half, about 1 1/2 hours. Form the dough into 2 or 4 balls, for small or medium pizzas, then either cook them as desired or wrap them well and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw frozen dough at room temperature, then shape and cook.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray. Add the olive oil to a medium saute pan over medium-high heat and cook the sausage until brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon and allow to cool slightly. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a long oval about 10 inches wide by 18 inches long. Spread 1/2 cup pesto in the middle of the dough, leaving about a 2-inch dough border. Add the mortadella, pepperoni, salami and mozzarella to the cooked sausage and toss to combine. Scoop the sausage mixture on top of the pesto. Fold both sides of the dough lengthwise around the filling to create a seam along the center of the log. Crimp the seam to seal. Place in the greased Bundt pan seam-side up. Poke holes along the top to release the steam. Bake until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes. Place a cutting board on top of the Bundt pan and flip the wreath out carefully, then remove the pan. Form a sun-dried tomato bow by cutting one sun-dried tomato in half lengthwise. Arrange the remaining 2 sun-dried tomatoes end-to-end, then wrap one of the halves around its center and secure with a toothpick to make the bow. Cut the remaining half lengthwise into 2 pieces and arrange them hanging down from behind the back of the bow, securing with a toothpick. Serve the wreath with the remaining pesto in a bowl in the center. Garnish with the sun-dried tomato bow and gaze at the glory of the sausage wreath! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 41709,&quot;Beans Stroganoff 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 1/2 cups mushroom broth 3 tablespoons vegetarian Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Two 15-ounce cans navy beans, drained and rinsed 3/4 cup sour cream 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped, plus more for serving Toasted bread or cooked egg noodles, for serving Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cremini mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms have released their liquid, softened and are just starting to crisp up, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the thyme and garlic until just fragrant and the garlic is softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mushroom broth, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of pepper and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium low, fold in the beans and sour cream and stir until combined. Simmer until warmed through and the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley. To serve, spoon the beans over toasted bread or egg noodles and garnish with more chopped parsley. Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 41710,&quot;Roasted Autumn Vegetable Clafoutis 2 carrots, diced small 2 parsnips, peeled and diced small 2 small turnips, peeled and diced small 1 sweet potato, peeled and diced small Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Kosher salt 5 sprigs fresh rosemary 12 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 shallots, sliced thinly 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 2 cups diced Honeycrisp apple 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 large eggs 3/4 cup half-and-half 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Add the carrots, parsnips and turnips to one baking sheet. Add the sweet potatoes to a separate baking sheet. Drizzle each with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Add 2 sprigs of rosemary and 5 sprigs of thyme to each baking sheet. Roast about 30 minutes, rotating the sheets and tossing the vegetables about halfway through. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a 10-inch cast-iron or other oven-safe saut pan. Add the shallots, sage and some salt, and saut until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the apples and a pinch of salt and cook until the apples are softened but still have some bite, an additional 4 minutes. Once the vegetables are done roasting, combine them in the saut pan with the shallot-apple mixture. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Remove the leaves of the remaining sprig rosemary and 2 sprigs thyme and chop. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, half-and-half, rosemary and thyme, 1/4 cup Parmesan and some salt. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan over the top. Bake until golden and set, 30 to 35 minutes.

Griddle Cooking Station and preheat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile whisk the eggs in a medium bowl until well beaten. Whisk in 1 teaspoon salt and set aside. Put the bacon over medium heat in a single layer. Once the fat starts to render, spread some of it to the low-heat side of the griddle, for the biscuits to cook in. Press the individual biscuits between your hands to help flatten and widen them, then arrange them on the low-heat side in a tight circle. Cover the biscuits with a 12-inch heavy-duty round basting cover or dome and cook until golden on one side, about 8 minutes. Uncover, flip each biscuit, cover again and continue to cook until golden and fluffy on the inside, 8 to 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, as the bacon cooks, move the cooked pieces to the low-heat side of the griddle, positioning them between you and the biscuits; the fat will continue to render and run towards the drain for the biscuits to fry in. When all the bacon is cooked, after about 8 minutes, reduce the medium-heat side to low. Add the spinach, spread it in a single layer and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Spread the spinach out over a rough rectangular area covering about a third of the griddle. Pour the eggs over the spinach and with the back of a large spatula, spread the eggs into an even rectangle. Arrange 2 rows of 4 slices of pepper jack cheese on half of the egg rectangle, then top each slice of cheese with a tomato slice. Using a large metal spatula, flip the plain half of the eggs over the cheese- and tomato-topped half, like a book, to enclose the filling. Using the side of the spatula, cut between the cheese slices, resulting in 8 stuffed egg squares. Split each biscuit in half and fill with an egg square and 2 pieces of bacon. Serve with hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 41712,&quot;Vegan Gnocchi Rock salt 4 organic russet potatoes (other potatoes will work, but you may want to switch to bread flour if you use anything else)<br> Kosher salt 1 tablespoon olive oil, optional<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose organic flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1/4 cup good-quality olive oil for cooking (not extra-virgin normally used in salad dressings) 2 cups shredded Brussels sprouts<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic<br> 1/2 tablespoon red cl flakes<br> 4 cups lacinato kale, also known as dinosaur kale (if you don&#39;t like kale you can easily use spinach or red Russian kale) 1 cup California walnuts, lightly toasted<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the gnocchi: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with rock salt. Place the russet potatoes on the rock salt-lined baking sheet. Bake until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and halve lengthwise. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. (I like to use an 8-quart pot and fill it most of the way with water.) Add a bit of salt to the water. Once the potatoes are cool enough to touch--don&#39;t let them cool completely, you want them to be as warm as possible but still be able to handle them--peel the skins and place the insides in a large bowl. Mash the potatoes until pretty smooth--it is best to run the potatoes through a ricer, but you can even puree them in a food processor. Add the olive oil, if using, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the flour to the mashed potatoes in 1/4 cup intervals, using your hands to work the flour in with each addition. You want to use as little flour as possible to achieve a perfect ball of dough. Once you think you have the right consistency, tear off a tiny piece, roll it into a ball and drop it into the boiling water. If it rises to the top without falling apart, that&#39;s good, but you still want to taste it. If it tastes gummy, add flour to the dough by the tablespoon until you get a firmer dough. You can turn the boiling water down to low while you form the gnocchi because this will take a little while. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Tear a piece off and roll into a long rope about 3/4 inch in diameter. Cut the rope in half, then with the two ropes next to each other, slice them into 1/2-inch \\pillows.\\ At Calafia, we do not pass the gnocchi on a gnocchi board or a fork. After they&#39;re cut, we freeze them in an airtight container. Turn the water back up to a boil. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In batches, drop the gnocchi into the boiling water. They will dance around for a while but once they rise to the top and stay there for a couple of seconds, they are done. Use a slotted spoon to remove (don&#39;t let them hang at the top of the water for more than a few seconds). Place the gnocchi on the lined baking sheets, making sure that none are touching. Reserve some of the cooking water. You can now serve them in whatever gnocchi recipe you desire, or you can store them for later (see Cook&#39;s Note). Enjoy! For the vegan gnocchi with kale: Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add one serving of the gnocchi cook until the gnocchi begins to turn brown. At this point, add in the shredded Brussels sprouts and cook until they begin to sweat. Then, add the minced garlic and red cl flakes and, once the garlic has become fragrant, add in a small amount of the cooking water you used to boil the gnocchi, just a couple of tablespoons. Add the kale, turn down the heat and allow the kale to cook down. The last ingredient is the toasted California walnuts. You can crush them into the pan as you toss them in so as to have walnuts in every bite. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 41713,&quot;Tenderloin of Beef in Mushroom, Mustard and Red Wine Sauce 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 beef fillet steaks (about 6 ounces each) Salt and coarsely ground black pepper 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, cleaned, stemmed and thinly sliced 1/2 shallot, finely diced 1/2 cup red wine 1/2 cup beef stock 1 tablespoon cold unsalted butter 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Sprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper on both sides. Place the fillets into the skillet and sear until golden brown. Turn the fillets over and continue cooking for 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare doneness. Remove the fillets to a plate. Remove all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the fat in the skillet and return to high heat. Add the mushrooms and shallots, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden brown and their liquid has evaporated. Add the red wine and cook until reduced by half. Add the stock and cook until reduced by half. Whisk in the butter and mustard and cook for 30 seconds. Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Garnish with the parsley.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Sift the flour, baking powder, nutmeg and salt onto a large piece of parchment or into a bowl. Combine the milk and vanilla in a measuring cup. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the whole eggs and yolks, one at a time, then increase the speed to high and beat until combined, about 30 seconds. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the milk mixture, and beginning and ending with the flour. Increase the speed to high and beat 15 seconds to combine and lighten the batter. Arrange mounds of batter (about 2 tablespoons each) about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are just golden brown around the edges, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Make the icing: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, corn syrup, lemon juice and vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium and add 6 to 7 tablespoons cold water, a little at a time, until the icing is smooth and spreadable. Transfer a little more than half of the icing to a medium bowl; tint orange with food coloring and set aside. Add the cocoa powder to the plain icing and mix on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium and add 1 to 2 tablespoons cold water, a little at a time, to make the chocolate icing the same consistency as the orange icing. Spread icing on the flatter side of each cookie, covering half with orange and half with chocolate icing. Let sit until the icing hardens, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 41715,&quot;Ham-and-Cheese Wafflewiches with Kale Chips 1 bunch kale (about 1 pound), preferably Tuscan 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and grated 1/3 cup honey mustard 8 frozen waffles 1/2 pound deli-sliced ham 1/4 pound sliced cheddar cheese 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: Make the kale chips: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Cut off the tough stems of the kale, then cut the leaves into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Toss the kale on a baking sheet with the olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt; spread in a single layer. Transfer to the oven and bake, flipping halfway through, until crisp, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sandwiches: Combine the apple and honey mustard in a medium bowl. Spread evenly onto 4 frozen waffles and top with the ham and cheese. Cover with the remaining waffles to make 4 sandwiches. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the waffle sandwiches and cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side, adding the remaining 2 tablespoons butter when you flip. Remove to a cutting board and cut the sandwiches in half.

Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and break the eggs into the well 1 at a time while beating the mixture has become a thick, uniform paste. Cover the bowl with a dampened cloth and allow it to rest for 1 to 4 hours. For the fish, place the flaked codfish, thyme, parsley, scallion, chives, allspice, and cl in the bowl of a food processor and grind them together into a thick paste. Fold this paste into the acras batter. Meanwhile, heat 2 inches of corn oil to 350 to 375 degrees F in a heavy cast-iron pot or deep fryer. Drop the acras into it by the teaspoonful. Fry until they are light brown, turning once.

Process until well blended and smooth. Transfer to a sheet of plastic wrap and roll into a cylinder. Wrap tightly and place in the freezer to chill. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room temp for 30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Sprinkle the steaks with salt. Heat a cast-iron grill pan over high heat until starting to smoke, then add a small amount of oil to the pan. Place the steaks in the pan and cook for 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 4 minutes. Turn off the oven and transfer the pan to the oven for 8 minutes, or until the steaks reach an internal temperature of 155 degrees F. Place 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining butter on each steak and allow the steaks to rest for 5 minutes before serving; the internal temperature will climb another 5 degrees.

Quarter the tomatoes, then slice each quarter into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Combine with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl; let sit at room temperature. Grate 3 of the garlic cloves into a 1-quart resealable bag. Add 1/4 cup of the oil, half the lemon zest and juice, and the chicken, and seal the bag tightly. Massage the marinade into the chicken, making sure it is evenly coated. Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, grate the remaining garlic clove into the carafe of a blender. Add the avocados, scallions, 1/2 cup water, 1/3 cup of the oil, the remaining lemon zest and juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, and puree until smooth. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the dressing, and refrigerate the carafe. Transfer the chicken to a plate or baking sheet, shaking off any excess marinade. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place the chicken and the bacon on the grill. (Note: If you have a charcoal grill, cook the bacon in a grill pan. It should not be grilled over charcoal because of the risk of flare-ups.) Grill the chicken until charred on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the deepest part of each breast reads 165 degrees F, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a cutting board, and let rest for at least 5 minutes. Grill the bacon, flipping as needed to ensure even cooking, until lightly charred on both sides and most of the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes; transfer to the cutting board. While the chicken rests, quarter the romaine hearts lengthwise, leaving some of the stem attached to each quarter. Brush the cut sides with the remaining oil, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill, cut-side down, leaving 1/2 inch of space between each quarter (do not crowd; grill in batches if needed), until 1 cut side is lightly charred, 30 seconds to 1 minute; turn and repeat for the other cut side; transfer to a cutting board, and let cool slightly. Cut into 1-inch pieces, and mound onto a large platter. Cut the chicken into 1/2-inch pieces, and crumble the bacon. Arrange the chicken, bacon, hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes (along with the juices) and blue cheese in rows on top of the romaine. When ready to serve, toss with the dressing, season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 41719,&quot;Fresh Lemonade 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (5 to 6 lemons) 1/2 to 3/4 cup superfine sugar, to taste 1 cup crushed ice 4 cups water Instructions: Place all the ingredients in a blender and process until completely smooth.

For the filling: Toss the blueberries and nectarines in a large bowl with the lemon zest and juice. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir to combine. Divide the filling evenly among 4 (6-ounce) ramekins. For the topping: Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor except the water. Pulse until combined, this will take about 30 seconds. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is clumpy but crumbly. Top each ramekin with the topping. Be sure to loosely sprinkle the topping and not pack it down. The idea is to look very crumbly and craggy. Place the ramekins on a sheet tray and bake in the oven until the filling is hot and bubbly and the topping is brown and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes. Sweeten the mascarpone with the sugar. Onto a small sheet pan or plate, neatly spoon 4 small portions of sweetened mascarpone and chill until ready to serve. Top each crisp with a quenelle of cold mascarpone. Serve the crisps warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 41722,&quot;Hot Chocolate Sugar Cookie Sandwiches 1 cup sugar 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup hot chocolate or cocoa mix 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 12 marshmallows, cut in half 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon honey Instructions: Process the sugar in a food processor until finely ground. Add the flour, hot chocolate mix, salt and baking powder, and pulse just to combine. Add the butter, and pulse until it is all incorporated into the flour and the mixture has a sandy texture. Add the eggs and vanilla, and pulse until the mixture comes together in big clumps. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface, and knead a few times to form a ball. Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a log about 8 by 1 1/2 inches. Roll each log up in a piece of parchment, and tightly twist the ends. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours up to 1 month. Position oven racks in the top and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut 1 log into 1/4-inch-thick slices (you should get about 24). Arrange 12 slices on each prepared baking sheet, and bake until the cookies lose their sheen and stay together when lifted with a metal spatula, about 12 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining log of dough. Arrange 24 of the cookies, bottom-side up, on a baking sheet. Put a marshmallow half in the center of each. Bake until the marshmallows puff up and are hot. Gently press 1 of the remaining 24 cookies on top of each marshmallow to form sandwiches. Let the marshmallow centers cool while the cookies are on the baking sheet. Microwave the chocolate and honey in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring in between, until completely smooth. Use the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula to spread some of the icing on top of each sandwich.

Cook the asparagus tips in lightly salted water. Steam, poach or grill the salmon. Skin or peel the potatoes, if you wish, and dice or slice them. Mix them with the asparagus and then with the dressing. If using mayonnaise and the potatoes are too hot, this will cause the mayonnaise the split. Grate in the lemon zest, add seasoning and the herbs, and fold into the salad. Spoon the potato and asparagus onto the plate, with a fillet of salmon on top. Whole herbs or baby greens can be used to garnish it, as can edible flowers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 41733,&quot;Emerilized Hawaiian Poke 2 tablespoons peanut chili sauce 1 1/2 tablespoons Ogo seaweed (optional) 1/4 cup sliced green onions 2 tablespoons toasted, chopped macadamia nuts 1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter 2 teaspoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 pound sushi-grade ahi tuna, medium-diced Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the chili sauce, seaweed, green onions, macadamia nuts, peanut butter, soy sauce, and sesame oil and mix well.

Through the feed opening of a running blender add, one at a time, the papaya, papaya seeds, Dijon mustard, vinegar, salt, pepper, and juice from the microwaved lemon. (Note: If you squeeze the lemon with the sliced side against your palm, the seeds are likely to stay in the rind.) Then with the blender still running, add the olive oil in a slow thin stream. Please note that the edible papaya seeds lend a wonderful mustard-y taste to the dressing, but are coarse in texture. If you find the texture to be too coarse for you, strain the dressing before use. Toss the greens, cucumber, tomatoes and papaya strings with enough of the dressing to coat, serving additional dressing on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 41735,&quot;Neely&#39;s Deep-Fried Turkey 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 tablespoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 (14-pound) turkey, giblets removed, washed and dried 2 3/4 gallons peanut oil, for frying* (See Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: After measuring the amount of oil needed for the deep-fryer, dry the turkey well, inside and out, before proceeding. Mix the smoked paprika, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and thyme together in a bowl. Sprinkle the spice rub inside the cavity of the turkey and on the skin. Separate the skin from the breast meat and massage the rub onto the meat with your hands. Put the turkey on a large sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours. Fill the electric deep-fryer with peanut oil and preheat to 400 degrees F, (it will take about 1 hour for the oil to come to temperature). Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature. Once the oil is hot and the turkey is at room temperature, very carefully lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make sure the oil maintains its temperature while frying. Fry the turkey until the skin is dark golden brown and crisp, or until the internal temperature of the breast reaches 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, roughly 45 minutes. Carefully remove the turkey from the oil and let it rest and drain on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. The internal temperature will rise to 165 degrees F while resting.

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and poach until the tomatillos are soft, about 10 minutes. Drain. Put the vegetables in a blender, add the cumin, and puree. Add the cilantro, lime juice, and salt, and pulse to combine. Set aside. Meanwhile, place the poblano peppers directly over the flame on a gas stove and cook, turning with tongs, until the skin is charred and blackened. (Or, if you have an electric stove, put the chiles on a baking sheet and broil, turning with tongs, until the skin is blackened.) Skin the peppers; then seed, core, and dice them. Heat a 2-count of olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Stir in the cumin and cook 1 minute. Then sprinkle on the flour and cook, stirring, 1 more minute. Gradually pour in the stock, stirring constantly. Bring to a simmer, stirring to make sure the flour doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom of the pan; the liquid will thicken. Fold in the chicken, diced peppers, and cilantro, and season well with salt and pepper. To assemble the dish: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Get your self a large baking dish. Dip a tortilla into the tomatilla salsa and put it on a cutting board.

In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the butter and brown sugar over medium heat, stirring, until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves and becomes smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Bring the mixture to a boil, then shut off the heat. Use a large spoon to spread the brown sugar mixture over the matzo, coating the tops of all the squares. Bake until the sugar bubbles and browns, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven. In a double boiler or microwave, gently melt the chocolate. Let the matzo cool 10 minutes, then use a rubber spatula to gently spread the melted chocolate over the brown sugar layer. While the chocolate is still warm, sprinkle evenly with the pumpkin seeds, apricots, sprinkles and salt, if using. Cool in the refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the chocolate to harden. Use a serrated knife to \\saw\\ the bark into neat squares or break the matzo into pieces. I like to serve this treat from a cookie tin or a little basket to make it even more fun to eat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 41743,&quot;Yellow Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 teaspoon lemon juice 4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Colored sprinkles, for serving Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Season the swordfish on both sides with salt and pepper. Wrap each steak with 1 or 2 slices of prosciutto, until just covered, without overlapping too much. Set aside. Using a paring knife, peel the oranges, removing all the white pith. Working over a mixing bowl to catch the juice, cut between the membranes to release the segments; add to the bowl. Add the raisins to the bowl so they plump while preparing the rest of the dish. Trim the stalks from the fennel bulbs, reserving the fronds for garnish; remove the tough outer leaves. Cut each bulb in half lengthwise, trim the base and cut out the core. Slice the fennel into strips as thin as possible. Put the fennel slices in the bowl and add the olives, anchovies, vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, the basil and fennel seeds. Season with salt and pepper and toss gently to mix. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.

With the mixer on low, slowly add 1/2 cup warm water and mix to combine. Only add more water if not coming together. Mix until the dough comes together and is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead a few times and then divide into 5 balls, each weighing about 100g (3.5 ounces) each. Set on a baking sheet, spray the tops lightly with oil spray and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside while you make the topping. (Can also be refrigerated up to 24 hours.) For the topping: Add the bell pepper, onion, parsley, garlic, tomato paste, paprika, salt, allspice, cumin, Aleppo pepper and mint to a food processor and buzz until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the lamb and pulse until it comes together. Transfer to a bowl. For the salad: Toss the arugula together with the lemon juice, salt and pepper and a hefty sprinkle of sumac in a large bowl. Taste for seasoning. Set aside. When you&#39;re ready to make the lahmajun, place a pizza stone in the oven on a rack about 5 inches away from the broiler element. Heat to 500 degrees F.

(Circle will be 9-to-10-inches wide.) Lightly flour a pizza peel or an upside-down baking sheet. Transfer the rolled crust onto it. Place 1/3 cup of the topping in the center of the dough round. Cover with a large piece of plastic wrap and, using your fingers, spread the meat mixture over the surface of the round in a thin, even layer, leaving a very thin border. Peel away the plastic and set aside to reuse for the remaining dough and topping. Carefully shimmy the lahmajun onto the hot pizza stone. Bake until the bottom of the crust and its edges are lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven. Place a handful of the dressed arugula on the cooked lahmajun. Top with sliced radish, roll the cooked lahmajun into a log and slice into pieces.

Add the red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Stir and cook until the sausage is cooked through, another 1 to 2 minutes. Use a ladle to remove 2/3 cup pasta water from the pasta pot and add it to the skillet. Add the kale and cook until it has started to wilt, about 30 seconds, then add the pesto and cherry tomatoes and cook, stirring gently, until the sauce has thickened and the kale has wilted, about 3 minutes. If the skillet starts to look too dry at any stage, add a little more pasta water. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the butter, lemon zest, pasta and Parmesan. Toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then serve in bowls garnished with the fresh basil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 41763,&quot;Pink Potato Salad 7 or 8 medium potatoes 3 beets 3 hard boiled eggs 3 carrots 2 sticks of celery 1 small onion 2 sour pickles 1 small can of sweet peas 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 3/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons sour cream Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Separately boil potatoes (25 min.), beets (30 min.), and carrots (15-20 min), until tender.

Coat a 10-inch aluminum tube pan or 2 (9 by 5-inch) loaf pans with 1 tablespoon of butter and dust with 2 tablespoons of the flour. Cream together the remaining 16 ounces of butter and the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer for 5 minutes on medium speed, using the paddle attachment. Stop once to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. With the mixer running at the lowest speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Again, stopping once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. This will take approximately 3 minutes and the mixture may look curdled. Add the vanilla and salt and beat on medium speed for 30 seconds. With the mixer on the lowest speed, add the flour in 3 installments, making sure each portion is fully incorporated before adding the next. After the final addition, scrape down the sides of the bowl and then beat for 30 seconds on medium speed until almost smooth. Scoop the batter into the prepared pan(s), dividing evenly if using 2 pans. Bake for 1 hour or until the internal temperature reaches 210 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. The crust will be golden brown and will spring back when pressed, but the crack around the center will appear moist. Remove the cake from the oven to a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan(s) and cool on the rack. Store the cake on the rack covered with a tea towel for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 41768,&quot;Warm Chicken-Cherry Waldorf in Romaine 1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast 1 cup sweetened dried cherries or cranberries 2 Granny Smith apples, cored and chopped 1 bulb fennel, trimmed and chopped 1/2 cup walnut piece 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 4 leaves romaine lettuce Instructions: Place the chicken in a large saucepan and pour over enough water to cover.

Prepare the cupcakes according to the package directions. Transfer to cooling racks and cool completely. In a clean mixer bowl, combine 1 1/2 tubs of the frosting and about 1/4 teaspoon blue food coloring. Beat until smooth and no streaks remain, adding more color if needed to make a light blue frosting. Dollop a tiny bit of blue frosting on the bottom of the liner of one of the cupcakes (this will help anchor it to the serving tray), then dollop a generous amount on top of the cupcake. Anchor the cupcake to a serving tray large enough to hold all 24 cupcakes. Repeat with the remaining cupcakes, arranging them in a 4-by-6 cupcake grid with the edges touching. Using an offset spatula, smooth the blue frosting across the tops of the cupcakes, adding more as necessary, so it appears as 1 layer and the individual cupcakes are no longer visible. Smooth the remaining blue frosting on the sides to cover the cupcakes but not the liners. Put the remaining 1 1/2 tubs white frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe the outline of a rectangle in white (about 5 by 7 inches) closer to one short edge of the cupcake grid to make the pool. Pipe around the outline of the rectangle all the way to the edges of the cupcake grid with white, leaving the inside of the pool blue. Smooth the white frosting with an offset spatula.<br> For the decorations: Arrange a row of blue candy-coated chocolates on the white frosting around the perimeter of the pool, then arrange another row of blue candy-coated chocolates around the outer perimeter of the cupcake grid. Fill in between the 2 blue rows with rows of white candy-coated chocolates to make the pool deck. Chill the cake 30 minutes to set the frosting inside the pool. Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in the blue gelatin until dissolved. Combine a mixture of water and ice in a measuring cup to make 1/2 cup. Stir into the dissolved gelatin until the ice melts. Chill the gelatin mixture while the cake chills. After 30 minutes, pour the gelatin into the pool. Chill until completely set, about 2 hours. Cut 2 strips of sour candy belt, each slightly larger than a graham bear, to make beach towels. Lay 1 bear on each towel and arrange them to relax by the pool. Add a drink umbrella over each to shade them from the sun.<br> Cut the candy necklaces open where they tie to make 2 long strips. Cut 2 strips the same size as the length of the pool and arrange them over the gelatin for lanes. Gently pull out and discard the strings, keeping the candies in straight lines. Arrange 3 bears around a jawbreaker in the pool to play a game of volleyball. Stick a bear in each gummy ring candy for floaties and add to the pool. Cut the chocolate chew into 4 pieces crosswise to make legs for the diving board. Cut a 1 1/2-inch piece from the white taffy and attach it to the legs to make a diving board. Set at the deep end of the pool and press a bear at the end, ready to dive in.<br> Cut the green taffy into a rectangle a little larger than a bear. With the back of a paring knife, score lines in the taffy to resemble the puffy parts of a blow-up raft. Stick a bear on the raft and add him to the pool.

In a mixing bowl combine the butter and sugar and beat, with a whisk or hand mixer, until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides periodically. Add the orange zest and beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Stir in the vanilla. Gently mix in the baking powder, salt and flour. Once the flour is incorporated fold in the almonds, raisins and anise. Divide the dough into 2 pieces. If the dough is sticky dust your hands with a little flour. Roll the dough into 2 logs the length of the sheet tray. Beat the egg white with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Brush the dough logs with the egg white and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven to a cutting board and slice on the bias with a serrated knife while they are still warm. Slicing while warm will prevent crumbling. Lay the biscotti back on the sheet tray(s), cut sides down, and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. This will harden the biscotti but not make them like rocks. Remove from the oven to a serving platter and serve with coffee or Vin Santo for dipping.
