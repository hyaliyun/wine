(6 oz.) DOLE? Tender Garden 2 oranges, peeled and cut in half slices 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored and thinly sliced lengthwise 8 pitted Kalamata olives, cut in half Orange Vinaigrette (recipe below) Instructions: Combine salad, oranges, fennel and olives in large bowl. Toss with Fresh Orange Dressing, to coat, as desired. Refrigerate any remaining vinaigrette. Whisk together 1/4 cup orange or blood orange juice, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard, salt and ground black pepper, to taste until blended. Makes about 3/4 cup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 13054,&quot;Fried Okra 1 pound fresh okra 1 cup self-rising cornmeal 1/2 cup self-rising flour 1 cup vegetable oil Instructions: Rinse the okra and dry with a paper towel. Cut the pods into 1/2 inch pieces, remove the tops. In a bowl, mix together the cornmeal, flour, and salt. Add the okra pieces to the bowl, stirring to coat with the cornmeal mixture, and then let sit for a few minutes. Stir again. When the breading clings to the okra, shake the bowl -- excess breading will go to the bottom. Heat the oil over medium heat in a frying pan large enough to allow the okra room to cook evenly. Spoon the okra out of the bowl and fry in the hot oil until browned all over, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the okra on paper towels before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 13055,&quot;Red Wine and Port Poached Pears with Mascarpone 1 1/2 cups ruby port 1 1/2 cups red wine 1 1/4 cups sugar 2 star anise 2 cinnamon sticks 1 bundle thyme 1 lemon, zested, not grated, but in big strips for easy removal 1/2 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 3 Bosc pears, peeled, halved and cored 1 pint mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 1/4 pound block semisweet or dark chocolate, to shave with a vegetable peeler Instructions: In a large saucepan combine the port, wine, 1 cup of the sugar, star anise, cinnamon, thyme, lemon zest, the vanilla bean and seeds. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the pears and simmer until the pears are cooked through, about 25 to 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool in the poaching liquid. Before serving, remove the pears from their poaching liquid and reduce the liquid to a syrup. Strain into a small bowl. Combine the mascarpone and remaining sugar in a small bowl. Dollop a small amount of the mascarpone on each plate and arrange a pear half on top to prevent it from sliding around the plate. Garnish the pears with a large dollop of the mascarpone, and drizzle with the reduced poaching liquid. Shave the chocolate over the mascarpone and serve.

Make sure they&#39;re eaten straightaway, while they&#39;re still crisp and hot. If you can&#39;t get hold of any flowers you can still make the recipe using just the zucchini - it will be like an Italian tempura. Beat the ricotta in a bowl with the nutmeg, the Parmesan, lemon zest and most of the chopped mint and chiles. Season carefully, with salt and pepper, to taste. To make a lovely light batter, put the flour into a mixing bowl with a good pinch of salt. Pour in the white wine and whisk until thick and smooth. At this point the consistency of the batter should be like heavy cream or, if you dip your finger in, it should stick to your finger and nicely coat it. If it&#39;s too thin, add a bit more flour; if it&#39;s too thick, add a little more wine. Open the zucchini flowers up gently, keeping them attached to the zucchini, and snip off the pointed stamen inside because these taste bitter. Give the flowers a gentle rinse if you like. With a teaspoon, carefully fill each flower with the ricotta mixture. Or, as I prefer to do, spoon the ricotta into the corner of a sandwich bag. Snip 1/2-inch off the corner and use this as a makeshift piping bag to gently squeeze the filling into each flower, until just full. Carefully press the flowers back together around the mixture to seal it in. Then put the flowers aside. (Any leftover ricotta can be smeared on hot crostini as a snack!) Now for the deep-frying bit. Get everyone out of the way if you can and make sure there are no kids around. Have tongs or a spider ready for lifting the flowers out of the oil, and a plate with a double layer of paper towels on it for draining. Pour the oil into a deep fat fryer or large deep saucepan so it&#39;s about 4 inches deep. Heat it up to 350 degrees F or, if using a saucepan, put in your piece of potato. As soon as the potato turns golden, floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, the oil is just about the right temperature. Remove the potato from the pan. One by one, dip the zucchini with their ricotta-stuffed flowers into the batter, making sure they&#39;re completely covered, and gently let any excess drip off. Carefully release them, away from you, into the hot oil. Quickly batter another 1 or 2 flowers and any small zucchini (or parsley) leaves if you have any - but don&#39;t crowd the pan too much otherwise they&#39;ll stick together. Fry until golden and crisp all over, then lift them out of the oil and drain on the paper towels. Remove to a plate or board and sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and the remaining cl and mint. Serve with half a lemon to squeeze over. Bloody delicious. Eat them quick! \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Add the cream, rum extract, cloves, egg yolk and 2 teaspoons of the nutmeg and beat until smooth. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until the dough just combines. Roll the dough into twenty-four 1-inch balls using a 1/2-ounce ice cream scoop or a tablespoon. Combine the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons nutmeg in a small bowl. Roll the balls in the spiced sugar to coat, and then arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the cookies, rotating the baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until golden brown at the edges, about 14 minutes. Remove the baking sheets from the oven, place on wire racks and immediately press a chocolate drop in the center of each cookie while it is still soft and warm. Do not move the cookies until the chocolate has completely set and the cookies are cool, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 13066,&quot;Blue Corn Crab Cakes with Black Olive-Red Pepper Relish and Basil Vinaigrette 6 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium red onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 jalapenos, diced 1/4 cup prepared horseradish, drained 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1/4 cup creme fraiche or sour cream 2 pounds lump crabmeat, picked over 2 to 4 tablespoons instant flour (recommended: Wondra) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups blue cornmeal Black Olive-Roasted Red Pepper Relish, recipe follows Basil Vinaigrette, recipe follows 2 roasted red peppers, peeled, seeded and diced 1/4 cup kalamata olives, pitted and chopped 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons basil chiffonade Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar Water 2 teaspoons honey 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saute pan over high heat.

Dredge each cake in the corn chips or cornmeal and tap off excess. Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick saute pan over high heat and fry the cakes for about 3 minutes on each side, or until crusty and lightly browned.

If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Add the sugar, butter, cream and honey to a heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over direct heat. Whisk until the sugar dissolves. Stir together the crushed almonds, flour, salt and orange zest in a large bowl, then pour into the sugar mixture and mix to combine. Allow the mixture to cool, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. (The batter can be chilled overnight if you have the time.) Invert a cast-iron skillet over direct heat and place a piece of foil on it. Spoon teaspoon-sized amounts of batter onto the skillet, pressing out so the almonds are distributed evenly. Move the skillet over indirect heat and bake until the cookies bubble and caramelize, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the grill and place the foil on a cutting board to allow the cookies to cool faster. Once cool, gently peel the cookies off the foil and serve! (Alternatively, you can bake the cookies on aluminum foil-lined baking sheets in a 350 degrees F oven until they bubble and caramelize, 10 to 12 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 13073,&quot;Garam Masala Grilled Strip Loin One 10-ounce strip loin steak 2 tablespoons Garam Masala, recipe follows A pinch of salt A pinch of pepper Oil, for the grill 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon cumin seeds 1 tablespoon mixed peppercorns 6 green cardamom pods 5 brown cardamom pods 6 cloves Two 2-inch pieces cinnamon stick Instructions: Rub the steak with the Garam Masala until completely coated.

In a small bowl, combine the cookie crumbs, brown sugar, salt, pumpkin pie spice and butter. Reserve about 1/4 cup for topping the finished cheesecakes, then press about 1 heaping tablespoon of the crumb mixture onto the bottom of each cup. Bake until golden, 3 to 4 minutes; let cool completely. Leave the oven on.<br> For the filling: In a medium bowl and using an electric mixer, combine the cream cheese, granulated sugar, eggnog, eggs, vanilla, salt and nutmeg with 2 tablespoons gluten-free flour blend and beat until smooth. Top each crust until each cup is about 3/4 full with filling. Bake until set around the edges but still jiggly in the center, 15 to 18 minutes.

Fit a baking sheet with a wire rack. Season the tenderloin with the granulated garlic and plenty of salt and pepper. Transfer to the wire-racked baking sheet and place on the middle rack in the oven. Roast low and slow until the internal temperature registers 120 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the tenderloin from the oven, cut off the butcher&#39;s twine and coat in the softened butter. Set the oven to broil. Broil each side until crusty and golden, about 30 seconds a side. Set aside to cool, reserving any juices for later. Slice the tenderloin as thinly as possible. We are looking for a smooth bite down here, so thin slices are key. Pour the accumulated juices over the slices and hit with more salt and pepper. Cut off the top crust of the boule about 1 inch down to create a lid. Hollow out the rest of the bread into a bread bowl. Smear the mustard over the bottom of the bread bowl. Next, spread with the Mushroom Duxelles. Then, add the sliced tenderloin; we are looking for a lot of height here, so ribbon those slices! Next comes a layer of baby spinach. Close with the top of the bread bowl and completely wrap in 3 layers of foil. Place a heavy wooden cutting board on top and use books, weights, giant cans, etc. to press down on the sandwich evenly. We are looking for maximum compression here, so 50 pounds is the goal. Just make sure the weight is distributed evenly. Press for a minimum of 4 hours at room temperature. Unwrap, slice into wedges and serve. Add the mushrooms, garlic and shallot to a food processor and pulse a few times until coarsely chopped. Heat the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add the mushroom mixture and stir. Cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until the mushrooms begin to brown. Season with salt and pepper, deglaze with the sherry, then add the fresh thyme. Set aside to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 13078,&quot;Second Time Around Veal Stew \\Marengo\\ Style 1 tablespoon butter 8 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and caps only sliced 1/4 teaspoon ground orange zest 1/2 cup chopped canned plum tomatoes 1/4 cup white wine 1/2 of veal stew done above 1/2 cup pitted sliced green olives Instructions: In a saucepan saute the mushrooms in butter until soft. Add the orange zest and tomatoes and white wine. Reduce until thickened. Add the veal stew and bring to a simmer.

Cut the cauliflower into florets. Place the florets on a baking sheet, drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss the florets to coat evenly and roast, stirring halfway through for even cooking, until very tender with brown and crispy edges, about 45 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Transfer half the florets to the center of a large clean dish towel. Wrap up all sides of the towel and twist it up to squeeze out the excess moisture. Squeezing out the moisture is very important because it will help prevent the crust from falling apart. Transfer the florets to a food processor and pulse until you get a rice-like texture. Repeat with the remaining florets. Line a baking sheet or pizza pan with parchment. Generously spray the parchment with cooking spray. Do not skip this step. In a large bowl, add the pulsed cauliflower, egg, goat cheese, oregano, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Use your hands and mix well. Press the dough out into a 9-inch circle about 1/3-inch thick on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the edges are crispy, 25 to 30 minutes. Spread the marinara sauce over the crust, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Add the cooked sausage, then sprinkle with the mozzarella. Return to the oven until the cheese melts, another 10 minutes. Let sit for 5 minutes, then top with basil leaves and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 13081,&quot;Halibut Provencale 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 1 shallot, minced 1 clove garlic, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade and minced 1/2 teaspoon finely minced fresh rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves 1 (16-ounce) can crushed tomatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 (4-ounce) halibut fillets 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 cup grape tomatoes, quartered 1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Heat grapeseed oil over medium heat in a saucepot. Saute the shallot and garlic until the shallots turn translucent, being careful not to burn the garlic. Stir in rosemary and thyme, add crushed tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes, then partially remove lid (leave it covered just enough to keep the spattering down) and reduce heat to medium-low, let thicken and reduce for another 15 minutes. While the sauce is thickening, season the fish with salt and pepper. Arrange fish on a steaming rack and steam over a pan of boiling water until it flakes easily, about 6 to 7 minutes. While the fish is steaming, remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the cream. Strain the sauce into a bowl. Spoon sauce into the center of serving plate, top with a fish fillet and fresh grape tomatoes.

Make 2 or 3 slits across the skin of the salmon. Place a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add enough peanut oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Just as the oil begins to smoke add the salmon, skin-side down and cook for 4 minutes. Lower the heat and cook the salmon all the way on the same side, about 10 minutes - it will cook from the bottom up. During the last 30 seconds or so, spoon some of the oil over the top of the salmon to help cook it through. While the salmon is cooking, make the sauce. In a stainless steel saute pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon butter and the oil. When the butter is melted, add the onions and cook until translucent but not browned, about 6 minutes, stirring constantly. Season with salt and pepper. Deglaze with the balsamic vinegar and red wine. Add the thyme and cook until the liquid is almost completely reduced, about 3 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Cook until the cream is slightly reduced and starts to thicken, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Be careful as the cream could boil over at this point. Once the cream is reduced, remove the thyme sprig. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Stir in the remaining butter. Spoon the onion marmalade onto plates. Top with the salmon and garnish with chive flowers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 13084,&quot;Fruit Punch 8 ounces peach nectar 2 cups orange juice 2 cups cranberry juice Instructions: Combine drink ingredients in a large punch bowl or pitcher. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 13085,&quot;Pineapple Fritters 1/4 cup sifted flour 2 tablespoons sugar Pinch of salt 2 eggs 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons milk 1/8 teaspoon grated lemon zest Dash of nutmeg Peanut oil for deep frying 2 pineapples 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar with a pinch of cinnamon Instructions: Note: batter needs to sit for a day in the refrigerator before cooking Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a medium-sized bowl.

Mix the sugar cookie mix according to the package instructions and divide the dough into 3 equal dough balls. Color one dough ball red and the other dough ball green so you have 1 plain, 1 red and 1 green. Tear teaspoon-sized pieces of each color dough and drop them on a piece of parchment or a silicone baking mat, alternating colors close together so it looks like confetti. Place a sheet of parchment or wax paper on top of the dough pieces and roll out to 1/4-inch thick. Refrigerate the rolled out dough for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour (this helps keep the cookies from spreading). Using a sweater cookie cutter, press out as many sweaters as you can and place them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Re-roll the leftover dough and keep punching out cookies. (Note, the more you roll, the cooler the dough pattern will be, but if you over-roll it, it will become a muddy color.) Bake just until the bottoms start to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely before decorating. Mix the royal icing according to the package instructions. Divide the icing into three bowls. Leave one bowl white, dye another red and the last green. Add the icing to piping bags or squeeze bottles. Outline a cookie with one color, then another inside the first outline, working in from the perimeter and alternating colors until the whole cookie is covered. Drag a toothpick from the center of the cookie out to the edges to create a tie-dye effect. Repeat with the remaining cookies.

Set the short ribs back in the pot, put on the lid, transfer to the oven and bake until the short ribs are tender and literally falling off the bone, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Transfer the ribs to a board, then remove the meat from the bones and shred. Skim the fat from the top of the vegetables, return the meat to the pot and stir. Meanwhile, bake the baguette until warm, about 10 minutes. Split it down the middle and spoon the short rib meat down the length of the bottom of the baguette. Then spoon the veggies and some sauce over the top. Place the other half of the baguette on top, then slice into pieces with a sharp serrated knife.

Use 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to smear a patch in the center of the foil, large enough to hold the chicken side by side. Make a bed of the spinach in the center, then top with the chicken breasts, salt and pepper to taste the rosemary sprigs and leaves, and another tablespoon of oil. Sprinkle the lemon zest and juice over the chicken. Fold the foil over the chicken onto itself and crimp the edges as tightly as possible by making 1- or 2-inch folds, one after the other, each sealing the other. Seal the package very tightly, but leave plenty of room around the chicken. (You can prepare the recipe up to 3 hours in advance to this point; refrigerate the package.) Place a skillet large enough to hold the package over high heat. A minute later, add the remaining oil, then pour out all but a film. Put the package in the skillet; it will sizzle. About 2 minutes later, the package will expand like a balloon; be careful of the escaping steam. Cook for 5 minutes longer from that point. Remove the package from the heat, again taking care to avoid any escaping steam. Let rest for 1 minute, then cut a slit down the length of the top with a knife. Use a knife and fork to open up the package, then spoon the chicken, spinach, and juices onto a plate and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 13103,&quot;Hibiscus Margarita Lime wheels, for salt rims and for garnish Kosher salt 3 ounces hibiscus-infused tequila, such as Gran Centenario Rosangel 2 ounces lime juice<br> 1 ounce lemon juice<br> 1 ounce orange juice<br> 1 ounce orange liqueur, such as triple sec or Cointreau<br> 1/2 ounce agave nectar<br> 2 hibiscus flowers, for garnish<br> Instructions: Rub a lime wheel around the rims of two martini glasses to moisten.

Spray each cake pan and 1 of the cups from the muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray. Coat the pans lightly with flour, tapping out the excess. In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the cake mix with butter. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix to incorporate. Slowly add the buttermilk and mix on medium for 2 minutes, until well incorporated. Fill each prepared pan and muffin cup 2/3 of the way to the top. Bake for 30 to 50 minutes or until tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. The large cake will take closer to 50 minutes, while muffin will be closer to 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely, right side up, on a wire cooling rack. Royal icing: In a medium bowl beat together the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and lemon juice with a hand mixer or whisk, and slowly add some of the water until smooth. Continue to add water by the teaspoonful with the beaters running until the icing drops from the beaters, but holds a line when drawn in with the back of a spoon. Fill the resealable bag with royal icing and snip the corner when ready to use. To assemble: Using a clean pastry brush, lightly coat the sugar cones with piping gel. Hold the cones over a plate and sprinkle each with the pink and orange sprinkles. Make sure the cones are completely coated with nonpareils. Set aside to dry slightly. Using a serrated knife, level the tops of each of the square cakes and the muffin. Adhere 1 square cake to the 7-inch square cardboard cake board, and the muffin cake to the 3-inch round cardboard cake board with a dab of frosting. Put a layer of frosting on top of the square cake and put the second layer on top of that. Ice both cakes with a thin layer of frosting and put in the refrigerator to set up about 15 minutes. Ice the cakes again with a slightly thicker layer of frosting. Knead the fondant to make it more pliable. On a clean surface dusted with cornstarch roll out 3/4 of the fondant to 1/4-inch thickness. Lift with the backsides of your hands and put it over the center of the frosted square cake. Lightly dust your hands with cornstarch, and smooth the fondant down and around sides of cake. Lift the cake up and trim the excess fondant close to the cake board with kitchen shears or a paring knife. Repeat with the small muffin cake and the remaining fondant, then place center it on top of the square cake. Pipe a small bead of royal icing around the base of each sugar cone and put 1 on each corner of the square cake and 1 atop the center of the small round muffin cake. Using royal icing for &#39;glue&#39; adhere the licorice candies vertically around the sides of the small round cake, close to the top of the cake, spacing them out. Take 2 pink and 1 orange licorice twists and twist them together to form 1 rainbow twist. Repeat with the remaining twists. Secure the licorice twists vertically to the 4 corner edges of the cake with royal icing and toothpicks, if needed. It should cover the edge from the bottom of the cake to the top. Cut 2 orange sour candies in 1/2 along the diagonal and put each 1/2 atop the licorice twists. Arrange 5 orange (Spree) candies in a horizontal line towards the top of 1side of the cake. This will be the front of the cake. Attach the strawberry and cherry candies in a grid pattern close to the bottom of the cake, under the line of orange candies to form a doorway.

Season the liquid with salt and pepper. In the meantime prepare the artichokes. Wash artichokes under cold water. Using a heavy stainless steel knife, cut off the stems close to the base. Pull off the lower petals that are small and tough. Cut off the top inch of the artichoke and rub with half a lemon to preserve the green color. Alternatively, you may put the artichokes in acidulated water. If you wish, trim the thorny tips of the petals with kitchen shears. Place the artichokes in the steaming liquid, bottom up. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes. The artichokes are done when a knife is inserted into the base and there is no resistance. To eat, pull off a leaf and scrape the meat off the tender end with your front teeth. Dip the ends of the leaves in lemon juice and melted butter if desired. When you reach the center cone of purple prickly leaves, remove it. This is the choke that protects the heart. Now, scrape away the thistle fuzz covering the artichoke heart. The heart is the meatiest part of the artichoke.

To make the Cake: Butter the jelly roll pan and line it with parchment paper; then butter the paper to assure release. Bring a saucepan of water to a simmer. In the bowl from a standing mixer, combine the eggs, yolks, sugar, vanilla in a bowl and whisk briefly. Set the bowl over the simmering water and stir until warm and the sugar looks dissolved. Attach the bowl to the standing mixer fitted with a whisk, and whip until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, sift together the flour, cocoa, and baking powder 3 times. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, while folding the egg mixture, sift in the flour mixture, little by little, until incorporated. Drizzle in the clarified butter, while folding the batter. Immediately pour the batter into the prepared pans dividing equally and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake until lightly browned and it starts to pull away from the edges of the pan, about 14 to 16 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and let sit in the pan for 1 minute. Run a knife along the edge to release the cake then flip it out onto parchment paper. Brush the paper (the one you lined the pan with) with water and let soak for 2 minutes. Peel it off the cake. Trim dry edges from the cake. Let cool covered with plastic wrap. To make the Filling: In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the sugar and butter and mix on low speed until well blended; then increase speed to medium and beat for another 3 minutes. Add vanilla and cream and continue to beat on medium speed for 1 minute more, adding more cream for spreading consistency, if needed. Spread the sponge cakes with a thin layer of the filling, leaving a 1/4-inch space at the far edge. Roll the cake tightly on the long side until you have rolled a 1 1/2-inch thick log. Cut the log off from the remaining sheet of cake and place seam side-down. Repeat with remaining cake. Chill the logs for 30 minutes; then cut into 2 1/2-inch sections. To make the Glaze: Melt the 2 ingredients together in the top of a double boiler or a bowl set over barely simmering water, stirring occasionally.

Regulate the temperature with a candy thermometer. Keep the potato sticks in a bowl of water to prevent browning before frying. Transfer to paper towels and dry well. Working in batches, fry the potatoes until they are cooked through and tender but have no color, 4 to 5 minutes. Be sure the fries have plenty of room and gently swish them around as they are cooking. Transfer immediately to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Raise the temperature of the oil to 375 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry the egg sunny-side up until the whites are just set, 3 to 4 minutes. Working in batches, fry the fries a second time at 375 degrees F, until they are golden brown and crispy. Transfer immediately to paper towels and toss with salt. Transfer to a serving platter, smother with the Fontina Cheese Sauce and top with the egg. Garnish with chives. Place the butter and onions in a large saucepan, sprinkling with salt, and cook until soft and aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture looks like wet sand, 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk and season with salt. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Stir in the mustard and hot sauce and cook over low heat until the mixture is slightly thicker than heavy cream. Whisk in the fontina and Parmigiano-Reggiano to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more mustard and hot sauce, if needed, adding a little more milk if the mixture seems too thick. Stir in the diced ham. The sauce should be very creamy and flavorful. Keep warm and reserve until the fries are ready. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 13120,&quot;Quick Tomato Sauce 1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or garlic oil 1 jalapeno pepper, optional 1 yellow onion, finely chopped 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 bay leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup drained and chopped oil-packed dried tomatoes 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano leaves Instructions: Open the can of tomatoes and pour off the juice into a bowl. Use the lid to press against the tomatoes to extract as much juice as possible. Then use your hand to squeeze the tomatoes to a pulp. Reserve the juice and pulp separately and set the empty can aside. Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until hot. If using the jalapeno, tilt the pan to collect the oil in a little pool against the side and drop the jalapeno into the oil. Cook until light brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the jalapeno and reserve. Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook briefly until light gold. Add the bay leaf. Add the tomato juice and bring to a boil. Simmer rapidly for several minutes. Add the crushed tomato pulp. Then rinse the remaining pulp out of the can by filling it halfway with water and add that to the pan. Add the jalapeno, and salt and pepper, to taste, and return to a boil. Add the dried tomatoes and stir. Lower the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the mixture thickens and the tomatoes have turned an orange-red versus the pale blue-red they were straight from the can, about 30 minutes. Add the oregano halfway through the cooking. Discard the bay leaf. Peel, seed, and mash the jalapeno with a spoonful of the sauce and pass at the table so diners can add as much heat as they like to their plates. Variation for quick tomato sauce: Substitute 2 pounds vine-ripened tomatoes for the canned tomatoes. Peel the tomatoes, cut in half crosswise, and squeeze out the juice and seeds over a sieve suspended over a bowl to collect the juice. Chop the tomatoes. Proceed as directed, omitting the dried tomatoes and using jalapeno, if desired. You should have about 2 1/4 cups sauce. The recipe may be increased proportionately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 13121,&quot;Meal Prep Instant Pot Shredded Chicken 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs 2 teaspoons garlic salt<br> 2 teaspoons sweet paprika<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Toss the chicken with the garlic salt, paprika, onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper until evenly coated.

Drizzle extra virgin olive oil over tuna and lightly coat steaks on both sides. Coat 1 side of the steaks with a generous amount of coarse ground black pepper. When the pan is very hot, add steaks, peppered side down. Sear and brown steaks 2 minutes, then turn, and immediately reduce heat to medium. Loosely cover pan with aluminum foil tent and allow steaks to cook 5 minutes for rare, 7 minutes for medium. Steaks should be firm, but have a little give and some pink should remain at the center. In a second skillet over moderate heat, coat pan with olive oil, add garlic and onion, and saute 3 minutes to soften onion bits. Add beans and chopped roasted red pepper to the pan. Heat beans through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in rosemary and parsley and season beans with salt and pepper. Combine escarole and radicchio in shallow dish. Coat greens with lemon juice, then a drizzle of oil. Season salad with coarse salt and toss well. To serve, pile a serving of beans on a dinner plate and top with tuna steak. Serve salad greens along side beans and fish. You can also serve this with sliced bread that has been toasted and then rubbed with half a garlic clove. To roast red peppers: Preheat broiler to high. Split and seed pepper and place skin side up close to hot broiler. Blacken skins of pepper. Transfer pepper to brown paper bag and seal. Let pepper cool to handle.

Once smoking, reduce the heat to maintain a temperature of 275 degrees F and cook the pork, covered, on the cooler side of the grill. Rub the pork Make the Neelys&#39; go-to barbecue seasoning: Mix the paprika, sugar and onion powder in a bowl. Transfer 3 tablespoons seasoning to a separate bowl, add 2 tablespoons salt and 3 tablespoons pepper, and massage onto the pork. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 1 day. (Reserve the remaining barbecue seasoning.) Prepare the wood chips: Soak 6 cups wood chips in water, about 15 minutes, then drain. Don&#39;t oversoak, or the wood will snuff out the fire. Light the grill: Fill a smoker or kettle grill with charcoal and light. (Pat uses lighter fluid; you can also use a chimney starter.) When the coals are mostly white, spread them out with tongs. Spread 1/2 cup of the wood chips over the coals (use 1 cup for a kettle grill). The temperature of the grill should be about 275 degrees F. Cook the pork: Place the pork fat-side down on a rack in the smoker or on the grill. Cover and cook, rotating the pork every hour or so, until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 165 degrees F, about 6 hours total. Feed the grill: As the pork cooks, add more charcoal and wood chips to keep the temperature between 250 degrees F and 275 degrees F and to maintain the smoke level. Make the sauce: Meanwhile, mix the ketchup, 1 cup water, both sugars, 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper, the onion and mustard powders, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, corn syrup and 1 tablespoon of the reserved barbecue seasoning in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, at least 2 hours. Let cool, then reheat on the grill when ready to use. Shred the pork: Transfer the pork to a rimmed baking sheet (you&#39;ll want to catch all the flavorful juices) and let stand until cool enough to handle. Shred into bite-size pieces, pile on a platter and pour any juices from the baking sheet on top. Make the sandwiches: Mound the pork on bun bottoms, paint with a little barbecue sauce, top with slaw and cover with the bun tops.

Cook, without stirring, over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium and boil uncovered until the sugar turns a warm chestnut brown (about 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer), 5 to 7 minutes, gently swirling the pan to stir the mixture. Be careful; the mixture is extremely hot! Watch the mixture constantly at the end, as it will go from caramel to burnt very quickly. Turn off the heat. Stand back to avoid splattering and slowly add the cream and vanilla. The cream will bubble violently and the caramel will solidify; don&#39;t worry. Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits. To assemble the sundaes, place 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream and 1 scoop of butter pecan ice cream in each dish and sprinkle with toasted pecans.

Place the 4 pieces of pheasant in a 6 to 8-quart stockpot and cover with the water. Bring to a boil, skimming off the white foam as it rises to the surface. (Using a ladle and a circular motion, push the foam from the center to the side of the pot, where it is easy to remove). Lower the heat so the broth is at a slow simmer. Meanwhile, remove the leaves from 3 springs of thyme, reserving the stems, chop, and reserve (you should have 1 teaspoon). Add the thyme stems and the remaining thyme sprig to the broth. Also add the coarsely chopped onion and carrot, the celery, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and cloves, along with the reserved bacon rind, to the pot. Season lightly with salt, partially cover, and simmer slowly for 2 hours. Remove the broth from the heat. With tongs, transfer the pheasant pieces to a plate. When they are cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones, discarding the bones, and tear the meat into bite-sized pieces. Or cut the meat with a knife into rectangular strips that are approximately 1/2 by 1-inch. (If you used whole pheasant, you will have about 1 pound of meat). Cover and refrigerate until needed. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer; you should have about 8 cups. If you are not making the chowder right away, let the broth cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the broth after it has chilled completely. (The broth and meat can be prepared a day in advance if you like) Heat a 4 to 6-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the bacon. Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat, leaving the bacon in the pot. Add the butter, the diced onion, the sliced carrot, the reserved thyme leaves, and the caraway seeds and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the onion is softened but not browned. Add the potatoes and the reserved pheasant broth, bring to a simmer, and simmer over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through but still firm. Add the cabbage and simmer for 5 minutes more, until it just begins to soften (it will continue to cook after the chowder is removed from the stove). Remove the chowder from the heat, stir in the pheasant meat, and season to taste with salt and black pepper. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely. Otherwise, let it sit at room temperature for up to 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld. When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat; don&#39;t let it boil. Use a slotted spoon to mound the pheasant, cabbage, onions, and potatoes in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls, and ladle the clear broth around.

Pulse 4 or 5 times, until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Set aside. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup and water in a 2-quart pot. Place over medium heat, cover and cook for 4 minutes. Add the butter, clip on a candy thermometer and bring the sugar syrup to 230 degrees F, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and remove the thermometer. Add the vanilla and the dry mixture and stir continuously with a silicone spatula until well combined. Pour onto a half sheet pan lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mixture is cool enough to handle. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Add 2 or 3 drops of yellow food coloring to one piece and knead until the color is consistent throughout. Add 2 or 3 drops of orange to the second piece and knead until the color is consistent throughout. Leave the third piece white. Roll each piece of dough into a strand about 18 inches long. Cut each strand in half and roll each piece into a strand that is about 1/2 inch thick and 22 inches long. Lay the strands side by side (orange, yellow, then white) and press them together using your fingers. Cut into 4-inch pieces. Then, using a ruler or bench scraper, press each piece into a wedge, keeping the orange section wide and making the white part come to a tip. Use a wire butter slicer, knife, bench scraper or pizza cutter to cut each wedge into individual candies. Lay the candies on a piece of parchment until dry, at least 1 hour.

Remove any excess fat at the cavity opening and at the neck. Use a sharp boning or butcher&#39;s knife to cut the back on either side of the spine. Remove the spine and reserve for stock. Cut through the breastbone of the duck to give you 2 halves. Cut the legs from each half as well as the first two digits of the wings. Set the legs aside, and cut the breasts in half horizontally. Season the duck with 1 teaspoon of salt and the black pepper. Place a large Dutch oven over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until hot. Place the seasoned duck, skin side down in the pan and sear until golden brown, about 7 to 8 minutes. Turn the duck over and sear on the second side as well for an additional 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the duck from the pan and place on a platter while you make the roux. Add the vegetable oil to the pan as well as the flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir the roux continuously over medium heat until the color of dark chocolate, about 20 to 25 minutes. Add the mushrooms, onions, celery and peppers and garlic to the roux and stir, gently until the mushrooms and vegetables are slightly wilted, about 4 to 5 minutes. Pour the beer over the vegetables and stir to incorporate. Add the stock/water to the pan with the thyme, bay leaves, Essence, cayenne pepper and the remaining 3 teaspoons of salt. Stir the pot well to ensure that the roux and the stock are well blended. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring the gumbo to a boil; then lower to a simmer. Return the seared duck pieces to the pan and cook (skimming any foam that may rise to the surface), for 1 hour and 30 minutes. After an hour and a half, remove the duck pieces from the gumbo and place on a platter to cool. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, remove the skin and meat from the bones and add the meat to the gumbo. Discard the skin and bones and re-season the gumbo, if necessary. To serve the gumbo, ladle 1 cup into a heated soup bowl with 1/4 cup white rice. Garnish with the green onions and chopped parsley. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch, published by William Morrow, 1993. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 13159,&quot;Italian Style Hot Dogs Cooking oil, suitable for frying 2 medium potatoes, cut into 1/4 to 1/2-inch rounds 4 all-beef hot dogs 1 medium onion, sliced 1 green or red pepper, sliced 1 medium round loaf of bread, from pizza dough or Italian bread Mustard Ketchup Red pepper flakes Instructions: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, heat enough oil to cover the potatoes to frying temperature (325 to 350 degrees F), and add the potato rounds. Turn them over when they begin to stick to the pan, and fry until the potatoes are browned and crispy on the outside. (The potatoes can also be cooked in a deep fryer for 3 to 5 minutes.) Set the potatoes aside, and turn the heat down to medium. Add the hot dogs, onions and peppers to the remaining oil in the saucepan. Let them cook together and exchange flavors until the hot dogs are done and the onions and peppers are beginning to brown. To build The Single: Cut the bread into quarters. Starting at the point of one wedge, slice open through the soft middle of the bread, not across the crust and not completely in half. You should be able to peel open the bread just enough to make a pocket for the dog. Mustard can be added to the inside of the bun. Place one dog on the bottom, then pile with the onions, peppers and about half a potato worth of rounds. If the toppings are overflowing the bun, you&#39;re doing it just right. Ketchup and sprinkled red pepper flakes can be added on top. Have a fork handy! To build The Double: Cut the bread in half. Slice open a pocket in the middle of the half-moon. Put 2 hot dogs on the bottom and double everything, especially the potato rounds - about 1 potato&#39;s worth can fit on top!

In a large bowl, combine the duck drumettes, garlic, thyme, salt, sugar, juniper and peppercorns. Rub the wings to coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. In a large hotel pan or baking dish, submerge the drumettes in the fat so that the wings are fully covered. If the wings are not completely submerged, add olive oil to cover. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake until the meat just starts to pull away from the end of the bone, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Allow the wings to cool in the fat, then transfer them to a sheet pan. In a large bowl, dredge the wings in cornstarch to lightly coat. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large Dutch oven to 360 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the wings until cooked through and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Serve the wings with Orange-Habanero Sauce and Hot Honey Garlic Sauce. Combine the marmalade, black pepper, hot sauce and salt in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.

Drain and cool the eggs in icy cold water, and then remove the shell. Put the flour in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Put the bread crumbs in a separate bowl and the beaten eggs in a third bowl. Take the eggs and coat them in the flour mixture, then the beaten eggs, and finally the bread crumbs. Keep them in the refrigerator until ready to fry. For the quails: Using a sharp knife, slice straight down the breastbone of the quail to open the breast cavity. Remove the rib cage so you have a boneless breast attached to the bone-in legs and wings. Cook&#39;s Note: If the breast breaks away from the legs, which can happen with such a small bird, cook each portion separately. Alternately, you can ask your butcher to de-bone the quails for you. For the herb garnish: Mix the parsley, basil, thyme, garlic, and olive oil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Season the quails with salt and pepper. In a large oven-proof saucepan, heat the canola oil on high heat and grill the quails in canola oil on all sides until brown. Finish cooking them in the oven for approximately 8 minutes. Keep the quails warm on a separate plate. For the creamed spinach: Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the spinach and cook for 15 seconds. Drain in a fine mesh strainer, pressing with a large spoon to release as much water as possible. In a small saucepan, heat the cream to a simmer and let it reduce by half, for about 10 minutes. Add the Dijon mustard and stir. Put aside. Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, stirring until soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, just until the liquid is released. Add the reduced cream mixture, season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Using a deep fryer, heat the oil to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Fry the eggs for about 1 minute, or just until the crust is lightly brown. For serving: Plate each portion with creamed spinach topped with a quail and garnished with the herb mixture. Finish the plate with the fried egg cut in half. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 13163,&quot;Texas Venison Chili 4 pasilla chiles, seeded 2 ancho chiles, seeded<br> 1 cl de arbol, seeded<br> 1 1/2 cup chicken stock, plus more as needed for pureeing<br> 2 corn tortillas, quartered<br> 6 tablespoons corn oil 1 1/2 pounds ground venison 1 large yellow onion, diced<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 tablespoons ground cumin<br> 1 1/2 cup dark beer<br> 4 cups chicken stock<br> 8 sprigs fresh cilantro 1 cinnamon stick<br> Fresh lime juice, for serving Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the chili puree: Combine the pasilla chiles, ancho chiles, cl de arbol and chicken stock in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chiles are soft, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly. Pour into a blender. Add the tortillas and puree until smooth. The chili mixture should be quite thick with just enough liquid to puree. You may need to add a bit of additional stock. For the chili: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When the oil smokes, add the venison and cook, stirring twice, until just brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the onion to the pan with the hot oil and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin and cook for 1 minute.

Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.<br> Meanwhile, make the chili: Preheat a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, then add the oil. Add the onion, garlic, and salt, and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the ancho cl, oregano, cumin, coriander, and cloves and cook, stirring, until dark and fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add the tomato paste and chipotle. Using your hands, crush the tomatoes while adding them to the saucepan and cook, stirring, until the chipotle and tomato mixture is dark red, about 2 minutes. Add the beef, break it up with a wooden spoon, and cook, stirring occasionally, until well-browned, about 3 minutes. Add the beans and beer and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and fragrant, about 15 minutes. Lay the potatoes on the side they naturally roll to, and carefully cut a shallow oval out of the tops to make 6 lids. Gently scrape most of the potato pulp out of the lids and transfer to a large bowl. Reserve the lids. Carefully scoop out the insides from only 4 of the potatoes into the large bowl, leaving the shells intact. Scoop out the pulp from the remaining 2 potatoes into a small bowl and reserve for another use. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Add 1/2 cup of the cheese, butter, salt, and scallion to the large bowl of pulp and mash lightly with a fork. Season with pepper, to taste. Lightly season the insides of the shells and lids with salt and pepper.

Thompson would have it this way) 6 teaspoons brown sugar Instructions: Set 1 oven rack on the highest level, then preheat broiler. Using a small serrated knife, cut around grapefruit to separate the fruit from the skin and the segments from each other (just like your mother did for you). Pour out a bit of the grapefruit juice to make room for the vodka. Drizzle 1 ounce of vodka over each grapefruit half and let it seep between the slices (I doubt your mother did this for you). Immediately before broiling, sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar over the top of each grapefruit half. Place grapefruit directly on rack under the broiler and broil for 3 minutes. Garnish with a raspberry or strawberry, if available. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 13179,&quot;Nacho Roll-Ups 1 avocado 1/4 cup cilantro leaves, chopped Juice of 1/2 lime Kosher salt 2 cups shredded yellow Cheddar (about 6 ounces) 1/2 cup sour cream 1/3 cup drained pickled jalapeno slices, chopped Six 12-inch flour tortillas One 15-ounce can refried black beans 1 cup corn tortilla chips, crushed Salsa, for serving Instructions: Cut the avocado in half, and remove the pit. Scoop out the flesh into a medium bowl, and mash with a potato masher until mostly smooth. Add the cilantro, lime juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and stir to combine. Refrigerate the guacamole, covered, until ready to use. Combine 1 1/2 cups of the Cheddar, sour cream and jalapenos in a medium bowl. Working on top of a long piece of parchment or wax paper (about 22 inches long), lay out 2 tortillas, overlapping in the center by 2 inches so the total width is about 16 inches. Spread 1/4 cup of the beans in a 2-inch strip across the bottom of the tortillas, then 3 tablespoons of the guacamole in a 2-inch strip above the beans, then 4 tablespoons of the Cheddar-jalapeno mixture in a strip above the avocado. Place a third of the crushed tortilla chips on top of the cheese layer. (You should be halfway up the tortilla.) Starting at the bottom, roll up the log as tightly as possible, using the parchment to help you roll and keep everything tight (but do not roll the parchment into the roll itself!). Spread a thin layer of beans to seal the end of the wrap. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes or up to overnight. Repeat with the remaining ingredients for a total of 3 rolls. Position the oven rack 4 to 5 inches from the heating element, and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Unwrap the rolls, and slice them into 1-inch-thick pieces (you should have about 18 per roll). Place the rolls cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet, and sprinkle the tops with just enough of the remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar to cover (about 1 teaspoon per piece). Broil until bubbly and browned, about 45 seconds. Serve while hot with salsa and any leftover guacamole. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 13180,&quot;Greek Zucchini Cakes 1 pound zucchini, grated 1 teaspoon kosher salt or 3/4 teaspoon table salt 3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese 1 large egg, lightly beaten 3 green onions, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup chopped pine nuts 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, or 1 teaspoon dried 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano leaves, or 1/2 teaspoon dried 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon freshly milled black pepper Olive oil Instructions: Combine the grated zucchini and kosher salt.

Heat on medium-low heat to the lowest detection of simmer; do not fry the garlic. Cook for 30 to 40 minutes until the garlic is golden brown. Drain and separate the garlic cloves from the oil reserving both ingredients. To puree the garlic, place the roasted garlic in a food processor and puree until smooth. Reserve. Butcher the Salmon: The salmon should be about 2 1/2 to 3 ounces in weight with no skin or fat. With a ring cutter, gently cut a nice circle of salmon from the center of each fillet. Reserve. Save all the salmon scraps to grind for the tartar. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Now, cook the salmon. First, season with garlic oil then salt and pepper. In a hot, oiled saute pan, add the salmon and let it sear on the topside first until golden. Flip over and brush the salmon medallion lightly with the garlic puree. Roast for a few minutes depending on your preferred doneness. Reserve. Note: This dish was created by using the salmon scraps. They are diced and mixed with classic ingredients of tartar. For the Tartar: Hand dice or grind all the salmon scraps and place in a bowl. Fold in the remaining ingredients, except butter and the quail eggs, using a spatula and reserve. Cook the Quail Eggs: Melt a little butter in a non-stick pan. Pre-crack the eggs and place in small, individual containers. Then cook them &#39;up&#39; over low heat and reserve. Saute the Veggies: In a hot, oiled saute pan, add the shallots and carrots. Saute for 30 seconds. Add the green beans. Saute for an additional 30 seconds and add a splash of stock. Saute for 1 to 2 more minutes, add salt pepper and butter and continue to saute until nicely cooked. Reserve. To plate: A bowl works nice for this dish. Pack about 1 1/2 ounces of the tartar into a ring mold; remove the mold. Place the salmon on top of the tartar. Tightly spoon the coulis around the center ingredients. Spoon some veggies tightly on top of the salmon. Then top it with the &#39;up&#39; quail egg. Now top with chervil and serve. In a blender, add the garbanzo beans, anchovy paste, capers, chili flakes, salt, pepper, and a splash of the chicken stock. Puree and add a touch more of the chicken stock to loosen. Now add the olive oil to smooth out the coulis. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 13185,&quot;Fudge Tops 4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup superfine sugar Pinch salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour Chocolate Ganache, recipe follows 1 cup heavy cream 10 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a small bowl, using an electric mixer or by hand using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, beat the butter, sugar, salt and vanilla until well combined. Do not overmix; you don&#39;t want the butter to become fluffy. Scrape down the bowl using a rubber spatula and beat for a few more seconds. Sift the flour into the bowl and mix on low speed or by hand just until absorbed. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula and mix again for a few seconds. Turn the dough onto the table, gather it together, and knead gently into a smooth mass. The dough can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Form the dough into a round patty and quarter into 4 even pieces. Roll each piece into a log and cut each log into 10 even pieces. Roll each piece into a 3/4-inch ball-about the size of a large marble. Place the balls about 1 1/2-inches apart on ungreased baking sheets and flatten gently and evenly with the heel of your hand so that they&#39;re about 1/4-inch thick. Bake for 22 minutes, or until the cookies just begin to color and the bottoms are golden. Let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. If the ganache was made 2 hours before, it will be soft and moussy. Whisk it a few times to thicken. If the ganache was made earlier in the day or the day before, it will be stiff. Warm it briefly, stirring gently, until it softens a little. Whisk it with 1 or 2 quick strokes. Be sure the cookies are completely cool. Place the ganache in a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Holding the bag in a vertical position about 1/2-inch above the cookies, pipe a large dollop of chocolate, leaving a small border of cookie showing around the edge. Repeat with the remaining cookies. The chocolate will firm up in about 1 hour. To hasten the process, refrigerate the cookies for 5 minutes. Serve at room temperature. In a small pot, scald the cream until bubbles appear around the edge and it&#39;s just about to boil. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped chocolate. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and dark. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside to cool until it thickens, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours. The ganache can be made the day before and left covered, at room temperature, overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 13186,&quot;Grilled Butterflied Rainbow Trout Olive oil 1 head escarole, cleaned 2 pounds baby artichokes, cleaned and halved 5 plum tomatoes, halved 5 shallots, halved 4 (12 to 16-ounce) whole rainbow trout, cleaned, head removed, and butterflied 2 cups flour Essence, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons very fine grated lemon zest 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley Essence (Emeril&#39;s Creole Seasoning): 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Preheat a grill.

When almost smoking, add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated from the mushrooms, about 6 minutes. Add spinach and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and place mixture into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until you get a coarse texture. Place in bowl and stir in mascarpone and Parmesan cheese. Check for seasoning and set aside. Line up 3 wrappers on a cutting board. Brush with the egg and water mixture. Using a tablespoon, arrange 4 dollops of the filling on each wrapper ? 2 on the first row and 2 on the second ? 1-inch apart. Place another wrapper directly on top, pressing around the filling and sealing the edges. Using a fluted ravioli cutter, cut out squares of ravioli. Each filled wrapper will yield 4 raviolis, giving you a total of 12 ravioli. Place ravioli onto a floured baking sheet and keep covered with a linen towel. In a large pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts of salted and oiled water. Carefully add small batches of ravioli, about 3 to 4 at a time. This will prevent them from crowding in the pot and sticking together. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer, carefully remove the ravioli and place on the plate. Tent with foil to keep warm and continue cooking remaining ravioli. In a saute pan, heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. When almost smoking, add chopped mushrooms and saute until soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Carefully pour in tomato sauce and simmer for 5 minutes. Divide ravioli between 2 serving plates. Top with mushroom tomato sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and bay leaves and simmer uncovered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors. Add 1/2 the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce. If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags. This will freeze up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 13194,&quot;Ziti Stufati 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium red onion, peeled and cut in half 1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed 1 carrot, peeled and grated 1 stalk celery, cut in half 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt Two 24.5-ounce bottles tomato puree, such as Mutti<br> One 4-inch Parmesan rind<br> 5 sprigs fresh basil<br> 1 cup ricotta, at room temperature 1 cup torn stale Tuscan bread, without crust (about 2 small slices) 1/2 cup milk, at room temperature<br> 1 egg, at room temperature, beaten<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley leaves, chopped Kosher salt 1 pound ground sirloin Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 1 pound ziti rigate, cooked in salted boiling water for 5 minutes 2 hard-boiled eggs, quartered<br> 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, torn into 1-inch pieces<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: For the sauce: Heat a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Pour over the buttermilk, toss to cover and marinate for 1 hour. Add the all-purpose flour, pepper, seasoning salt, paprika and cayenne to a shallow dish and mix. Whisk the milk and eggs in a separate dish. Remove the steaks from the buttermilk with tongs, shaking off as much excess liquid as possible. Dredge portions in the dry mixture first, then quickly add to the egg mixture, then back to the dry mix (dry/wet/dry). Place the breaded steaks on a baking sheet and repeat until all portions are breaded. (You can cover and refrigerate at this stage until ready to fry.) Heat the vegetable oil and butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Fry the steaks 4 or 5 at a time, flipping them midway through, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Cover the steaks loosely with foil to keep warm. For the buttermilk biscuits: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate the unsalted butter using the large grate of a box grater and place in the freezer for 2 to 3 minutes. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the self-rising flour, sugar, baking powder and salt and mix until combined. Add the grated butter and blend until the mixture is well combined and the butter is in about pea-size chunks. Slowly add in the buttermilk and heavy cream and mix until the dough comes together. Turn out onto a floured surface, use your hands to form into a rough rectangle and roll out to 3/4 inch thick. If the dough is still tacky, work in an additional 2 tablespoons self-rising flour to the dough. Dip the cutting edge of a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter into some flour, then cut out as many biscuits as possible. Gather the remaining dough, reroll to 3/4 inch and cut out additional biscuits until you have 18. Split the biscuits into 2 separate 14-inch cast-iron skillets, brush the tops with the melted salted butter and bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes. For the gravy: Into a glass measuring cup, pour off all the grease from the skillet where the steaks were fried. Add 1 cup of the grease back into the skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle on the all-purpose flour in 3 batches. Whisk the mixture until it becomes a paste. Whisking constantly, gradually pour in the milk and buttermilk. Add the salt, pepper and more milk if it seems too thick. Allow the gravy to cook and thicken. Lay out the biscuits, steaks and gravy for the sliders and have everyone help themselves.

Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat together the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just incorporated. Spoon half of the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle the blackberries on top. Spoon the remaining cake batter on top and smooth the top. Sprinkle on the crumb topping. Bake until the cake and topping are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan 20 minutes, then invert onto a plate; invert back onto a rack to cool completely. When the cake is cool, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk in a medium bowl until smooth.

Add the cooked spaetzle and saute until slightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the pan to a serving platter and set aside while you cook the mushrooms. Set the skillet back over high heat and add a little more olive oil and remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the thyme, mushrooms and garlic and saute until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the cream and mustard and stir well. Reduce the mixture until the sauce is nice and thick, about 3 minutes. Fold in the spaetzle. Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with chives and serve alongside the pork schnitzel, if desired. Spaetzle: In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. In another mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg-milk mixture. Gradually draw in the flour from the sides and combine well; the dough should be smooth and thick. Let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Bring 3 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot, over medium heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer. To form the spaetzle, hold a large holed colander or slotted spoon over the simmering water and push the dough through the holes with a spatula or spoon. Do this in batches so you don&#39;t overcrowd the pot. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the spaetzle floats to the surface, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Drain the spaetzle in a colander and give it a quick rinse with cool water. This can be made up to 1 hour in advance. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 13255,&quot;Collard Green and Artichoke Dip with Brown Butter Grilled Country Bread Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dish 18 ounces wheat beer<br> 1/4 cup cane vinegar<br> 1 bunch young collards, stemmed and chopped into bite-size pieces<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cloves garlic, minced Two 14-ounce cans high-quality quartered artichoke hearts, drained and roughly chopped<br> Three 8-ounce blocks cream cheese, softened<br> 1 teaspoon Cajun Select Seasoning, recipe follows 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella<br> Dash hot sauce<br> 1 cup shredded Parmesan Brown Butter Grilled Country Bread, recipe follows 2 tablespoons granulated garlic 2 tablespoons paprika<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon dried basil<br> 1 teaspoon ground celery seed<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1 stick salted butter 1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed<br> 1/2 French country baguette, sliced on a hard bias to make long pieces of bread<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Position the oven rack to just below the center of the oven so that when the cake is in the oven it will be central. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).<br> In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter, sugar, and molasses until the mixture is light and fluffy and pale in color. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, adding 1 tablespoon of flour along with each egg, to help prevent the mixture from curdling. Add 6 eggs and then check the consistency of the batter; it should be a \\dropping\\ consistency, which means that if you lift a spoonful of the mixture out of the bowl and turn the spoon over, the mixture should drop off the spoon in 2 to 3 seconds. Add more eggs, 1 at a time, until the batter reaches a \\dropping\\ consistency is reached.<br> In a separate large bowl, mix the remaining flour with all of the remaining ingredients, except the brandy. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and beat until just incorporated. Spoon batter into the prepared cake tin, and level the surface. Bake in the center of the oven for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. As cooking times can vary considerably in different ovens, check the cake regularly, covering the top with a sheet of parchment if the cake starts to brown too quickly; begin checking for doneness after 1 1/2 hours. To test if the cake is cooked, insert a skewer and then remove it; if it comes out clean then the cake is cooked; otherwise bake for a little longer. Also listen to the cake; if you can still hear it bubbling then it isn&#39;t cooked through.<br> Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Then spoon the brandy on top. Set aside until completely cooled. Remove the cake from the pan and then wrap it in parchment paper and then aluminum foil before storing it in a cool, dry place.<br> The cake may be eaten immediately but is best left about a month before decorating so that it has time to \\mature.\\ &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 13305,&quot;Kerala Fried Fish 2 tablespoons finely grated onion 2 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon finely grated garlic 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 pounds small fish (whole black bass) 1 cup all purpose flour Buttermilk Instructions: Combine onion, spice mixture, garlic, salt, and 2 tablespoons oil to form a paste.

To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. All these ingredients can be made in advance. Be sure they&#39;re room temperature when you assemble the salad. If you&#39;re nervous about raw egg yolks, substitue 2 tablespoons of real mayonnaise. Pancetta is Italian bacon. You can find it in your Italian grocery or a specialty food store.

Place a sheet of parchment paper on a sheet pan. Draw a 9-inch circle on the paper, using a 9-inch plate as a guide, then turn the paper over so the circle is on the reverse side. (This way you won&#39;t get a pencil mark on the meringue.) Place the egg whites and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat the egg whites on high speed until firm, about 1 minute. With the mixer still on high, slowly add the sugar and beat until it makes firm, shiny peaks, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer, sift the cornstarch onto the beaten egg whites, add the vinegar and vanilla, and fold in lightly with a rubber spatula. Pile the meringue into the middle of the circle on the parchment paper and smooth it within the circle, making a rough disk. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the oven, keep the door closed, and allow the meringue to cool completely in the oven, about 1 hour. It will be crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Invert the meringue disk onto a plate and spread the top completely with sweetened whipped cream. Combine the strawberries, blueberries and raspberries in a bowl and toss with about 1/2 cup of raspberry sauce, or enough to coat the berries lightly. Spoon the berries carefully into the middle of the Pavlova, leaving a border of cream and meringue. Serve immediately in large scoops with extra raspberry sauce.

Stir until the salt dissolves. Add 6 cups cold water. Add the pork, cover, and refrigerate overnight (the pork should be submerged in the liquid). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the herb rub: Mix the garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Remove the pork from the brine and pat it dry (discard the brine). Spread the herb mixture over the pork loin, making sure you coat all sides of the loin. For the pork: Heat the olive oil in a medium, heavy saute pan over high heat. Add the pork and sear until browned, 4 minutes. Carefully turn the pork over and sear until browned, another 4 minutes. Meanwhile, add the prunes and pearl onions to a 10 by 7 by 2-inch glass baking dish, creating a bed for the loin. Transfer the seared pork loin to the baking dish (making sure the loin fits in the baking dish, leaving a 1-inch border on every side). Add the wine to the same saute pan used to sear the pork and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan to remove the browned bits, until almost evaporated, about1 minute. Stir in the pineapple juice and remove from the heat. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the pork. Season the prunes and onions with salt and pepper. Place the pork in the oven and roast until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 160 degrees F, about 1 hour, basting with the pan juices every 20 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board, tent with foil, and let it stand for 10 minutes. Slice the pork into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices and arrange on a platter. Top the pork slices with the pearl onions, prunes, and sauce. Cook&#39;s Note: In place of a 3 1/2-pound pork loin, you can use 2 (1 1/4-pound) pork tenderloins. The total cooking time will be about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 13349,&quot;Grown-Up Apricot Newtons 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling dough 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into chunks, at room temperature 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 large egg, lightly beaten Filling: 1 tablespoon honey 1/2 vanilla bean, split and scraped, pod reserved 6 ounces dried apricots, coarsely chopped 1/3 cup golden raisins 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped pistachios Instructions: Put a baking rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a pizza stone on the rack. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the base: Whisk the flour with the baking powder, cardamom and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugars in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly drizzle in the egg and beat until combined. It&#39;s ok if it looks a bit curdled. It will come back together with the addition of the flour. With the mixer on low, beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Pat out two-thirds (about 8 ounces) of the dough into a 6-by-3-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 1 hour. Wrap the remaining chunk of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. For the filling: Whisk 3/4 cup water with the honey and the vanilla bean seeds in a small saucepan. Add the vanilla bean pod, apricots and raisins and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover the saucepan, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the water is mostly absorbed, about 10 minutes. Cool the mixture, remove the vanilla bean pod and then pulse in a food processor to make a textured paste. Roll the chilled rectangle of dough on a lightly floured work surface into a 15-by-5-inch rectangle. Gently lift it into a 13-by-4-inch rectangular fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. If the dough cracks, just press it back together with the flats of your fingertips. At the short ends the dough will come up to the top of the pan, and on the long sides the dough will come about halfway up. Spread the apricot filling over the dough in an even layer. Crumble the reserved chilled dough over the top, squeezing it flat between your fingers as you do. It is ok if some of the filling shows through, but make sure the dough is actually touching the sides of the pan. Scatter the pistachios over top, pressing in lightly where they land on the uncovered filling. Bake on the preheated stone until the top is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely on a rack, about 2 hours, before unmolding and slicing into 12 bars. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 13350,&quot;Seared Skate with Baby Root Vegetables and Sauce Grenobloise 8 small red beets with tops 8 small golden beets with tops Salt 8 small white turnips with tops 2 pounds spinach, cleaned, stems removed (can use 1 pound if beet and turnip greens are in good quality) 8 new potatoes 1/2 cup olive oil, divided plus 2 tablespoons 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, roughly chopped Freshly ground black pepper 2 large skate wings, skinned and filleted 2 cups Wondra flour 1/4 pound unsalted butter 3 lemons, 1 segmented and 2 juiced 3/4 cup demi-glace (chicken or veal) 4 slices white bread (not Wonder), cut into 1/2-inch cubes and toasted 2 tablespoons flat-leafed parsley, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons capers (non-pareil), drained Instructions: Trim both types of beets and wrap (2 per packet) in foil with a pinch of salt in each.

The flour should get toasted and brown, but do not burn it, about 5 minutes. Drizzle the roux into the red chili and mix to combine. This will make it thicker and change the color slightly, but it should not get white in color. The chili and liquid should just look darker and less bright than the red chili without any roux. Add enough roux and water to get the chili to the right consistency, which should be like gravy. You may not use all the roux. Add the garlic and salt. Leave the chili in the pot to simmer for 20 minutes, stirring regularly. Do NOT bring it to a boil, as that may burn the flour in the roux.

Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the chicken mixture onto the masa. Then roll the husk up to enclose the filling. Fold the narrow side of the tamale under and arrange the tamale, open-side up, in the steamer insert. Repeat with the remaining masa, husks and filling. Bring the water in the pot to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium, cover the pot and steam until the masa is cooked through and separates easily from the husk, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Warm the reserved sauce and serve on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 13358,&quot;Apple Tarts 1 package (2 sheets) frozen puff pastry, defrosted 4 small (6 ounce) Granny Smith apples 3/4 cup sugar 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) cold unsalted butter, small-diced 3/4 cup apricot jelly or warm sieved apricot jam 3 tablespoons Calvados, rum, or water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 4 squares. Divide the pastry between the prepared sheet pans and refrigerate while you prepare the apples. Peel the apples and cut them in half through the stem. Remove the stems and cores with a sharp knife and a melon baller. Slice the apples crosswise in 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place overlapping slices of apples diagonally across the pastry and place one slice of apple on each side of the arranged slices. Sprinkle the apples evenly with the sugar and dot them with the butter. Bake for 40 minutes, until the pastry is browned and the edges of the apples start to brown. Don&#39;t worry! The apple juices will burn in the pan but the tarts will be fine! When the tarts are done, heat the apricot jelly together with the Calvados until bubbly and brush the apples and pastry completely with the jelly mixture. Loosen the tarts with a metal spatula so they don&#39;t stick to the paper. Allow to cool and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 13359,&quot;SodaStream Zero Cranberry Raspberry Slushy SodaStream Zero Cranberry Raspberry 2? cups ice cubs 4-8 drops Stevia natural sweetener (depending on your sweet tooth and sweetness of your berries) 4-8 drops Stevia natural sweetener (depending on your sweet tooth and sweetness of your berries)<br> ? cup fresh lemon juice 10 ounces raspberries, frozen Lemon slices for garnish Instructions: Prepare the sparkling water: Fizz cold fresh water with SodaStream sparkling water machine.

In a large, stainless steel bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Gradually pour the heated liquid into the bowl, whisking all the while. Return to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in the honey, to taste. Transfer to a clean bowl and chill over ice cubes and cold water. Strain. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Just before the ice cream is completely set, stir in the Almond Nougatine, and continue to churn for a few minutes longer. Serve in a Sesame Seed Cup. Brush a small baking sheet with vegetable oil and set aside. In a medium-size, heavy saucepan, cook the sugar over high heat until it turns a caramel color. Stir in the almonds and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Pour out onto the prepared pan in a very thin layer and let harden. Cool. When completely set, scrape the nougatine onto a chopping board with a heavy spatula. Cut or chop into small bits. Store in an airtight container until ready to use. In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients, except the milk, until well combined. Let rest at least 30 minutes, up to overnight, refrigerated and covered. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using a 2-tablespoon measure, spoon some of the batter onto a non-stick baking sheet. Dip a fork into the milk and, using the back of the tines, gently pat the batter, spreading it into a very thin circle, about 6 to 8 inches in diameter. (The milk will prevent the sugar from sticking to the fork.) You should be able to make 2 to 3 circles on an 11 by 15-inch baking sheet, spaced about 2 1/2 inches apart. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Remove the pan from the oven and immediately shape over a 2 1/2-to-3-inch bowl or mold, forming a free form cup. Let harden.

Pulse a few times until the mixture resembles fine gravel. Add up to 8 tablespoons of ice water, a few tablespoons at a time, until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Remove from the food processor and form the dough into a disk; wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until ready to use. For the roast chicken: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a large bowl, slather the chicken with the olive oil and sprinkle with the granulated garlic, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan and roast until the skin is golden and crispy and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh reaches 165 degrees F, 45 to 60 minutes. Set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin, pull the meat from the bones and tear it into bite-size pieces (you need 4 cups of the meat for the pie). For the filling: Heat the butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, add the onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a dash of pepper and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the carrots, fennel and parsnip and cook until the vegetables are brightly colored, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and when fragrant, stir in the flour. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the sherry and scrape up any bits stuck to the pan. When the liquid has almost evaporated, stir in the chicken stock and milk and cook, stirring, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. If the sauce becomes too thick, add more chicken stock to reach the desired consistency. Remove from the heat and stir in the chicken, peas, parsley, thyme, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to a 1/4-inch-thick rectangle, about 15 inches long by 11 inches wide. If using individual ramekins, cut 6 circles in the shape of the ramekins plus an extra 1-inch overhang. If using a 9-by-13-inch pan or similar-sized shallow baking dish, cut to that shape plus an extra 1-inch overhang. Pour the filling into the ramekins or pan. Lay the dough over the filling and trim to 1/2 inch from the edge. Fold the overhang under itself to create a lip around the edge and use your fingers to flute the edges, or use the tines of a fork to create an attractive edge. Alternatively, simply tuck the overhang dough into the side of the pan. Cut a 1-inch vent hole in each small pie or four to six 1-inch vent holes in a large pie. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Lightly brush the pie crust with the beaten egg. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes for small pies and about 60 minutes for a large pie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 13405,&quot;Mini Brioche Rolls 1/2 cup warm water (110 to 120 degrees F) 1 package dried yeast 3 tablespoons sugar 6 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 4 1/2 cups unbleached flour 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon milk, for egg wash Instructions: Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (If the bowl is cold, start with warmer water so it&#39;s at least 110 degrees when you add the yeast.) Mix with your hands and allow to stand for 5 minutes until the yeast and sugar dissolve. Add the eggs and beat on medium speed for 1 minute, until well mixed. With the mixer on low speed, add 2 cups of the flour and the salt and mix for 5 minutes. With the mixer still on low, add 2 1/4 more cups of flour and mix for 5 more minutes. Scrape the dough into a large buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.<br> The next day, allow the dough to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, grease 20 mini brioche tins. Set aside.<br> Place the dough in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the softened butter in chunks, and mix for 2 minutes, adding additional flour as needed to make a ball.

In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites with a handheld mixer until frothy. Place the chicken pieces into the egg whites, mixing until each piece is covered. Sprinkle with a pinch each of garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir to distribute. Dredge the chicken pieces in cornstarch, draining most of the egg white from chicken by picking up a handful and allowing the egg white to drain while moving to the cornstarch. Cover the pieces completely by turning in corn starch. Pick up the chicken in handfuls and transfer from hand to hand to shake off most of the starch. If using a deep-fryer place the pieces into a fry basket. Lower into hot fry oil and shake basket after 10 to 15 seconds to make sure the pieces separate as they cook. Fry until the pieces float on top of the oil and are light brown, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. The chicken should appear somewhat dry, not oily, when the basket is lifted. If frying in a Dutch oven place pieces of chicken in hot oil and fry until light brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. For the garlic mixture: In a small bowl, add all the garlic mixture ingredients and toss to thoroughly combine. Place 1 tablespoon of hot chili oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil into a hot wok or saute pan over medium to high heat. Immediately put 4 tablespoons of the garlic mixture and 1/3 cup chopped green onions into the oil, stirring with a spoon to lightly cook the garlic mixture, being careful not to brown. Add approximately 2 cups of the fried chicken and toss to cover with the sauce. Finish them with a pinch of garlic salt. Toss once more and serve.

If the strips appear too large, they likely are the correct size, as they will shrink significantly during the cooking process. In a mixing bowl, mix the remaining ingredients. Liberally season the beef with this spice mixture, being sure to use it all. Cover the beef and refrigerate for 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Put the beef strips on a baking rack-lined sheet pan. Arrange the meat so that the strips are not touching or overlapping. This allows for even drying. Bake for 6 to 7 hours, until fairly dry. If you prefer your jerky on the chewy side, remove it after 6 hours. Otherwise, leave it in for the full 7 hours to dry it out some more. Divide the jerky among bags. Store the bags in an airtight container at room temperature; the jerky should keep for several months. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 13420,&quot;Fruit-Sweetened Chocolate Frosting 10 pitted Medjool dates, chopped 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder Instructions: Soak the date pieces in very hot water until very soft, about 5 minutes.

Set aside to marinate. Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill with a cover, or preheat a gas grill to medium-high. If a grill is unavailable, simply heat a grill pan over medium-high heat on your stovetop. To make the Patties, combine the pork, garlic, diced chiles, ginger, fish sauce, soy sauce, five-spice powder, sugar, and lime zest and juice in a bowl, mixing well to incorporate. Divide the mixture into 6 portions and form into round patties. Brush the grill rack with vegetable oil. Place the patties on the rack and grill for 6 to 7 minutes per side, until cooked through. Turn the patties 90 degrees halfway through cooking on each side, to attain grill marks. Spread the cut side of each bun half with 1/2 tablespoon butter and grill until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Spread 1 tablespoon of the mayonnaise on the cut side of each bun bottom and 1 tablespoon of the pate on the cut side of each bun top. Place the cucumber and cl slices on the bun bottoms and top with burger patties. Drain the carrot and daikon pickles and pile a generous amount atop each patty. Add the cilantro sprigs and the pate-smeared bun tops. Enjoy! Cook&#39;s note: These burgers can also be served on baguettes, if preferred, in which case, the patties should be formed into oblong shapes. Hamburger buns are a bit softer and easier to manage, which is why I&#39;ve chosen them for this recipe. If available, buy a peppercorn pate, which adds a great hint of black pepper to the burger. For serving, burgers can be halved and skewered for a beautiful presentation and manageability. They go well with sweet potato french fries or taro chips!

Add about a 1/3 of the chilled butter cubes and process until the butter is absorbed. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the butter is the size of peas, 5 or 6 pulses. Add the vinegar. Then, pulsing quickly a few times as you do it, add the ice water through the tube. Squeeze some dough between your fingers; it should just hold its shape without feeling wet. If it is crumbly, add more ice water a tablespoon at a time. Pulse quickly; do not overwork or the dough will be tough. Wrap the dough loosely in a large piece of plastic wrap, then firmly press and flatten the dough into a thin round. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Lightly dust a work surface with flour, roll the dough out into an 11- to 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Center the dough in a 9-inch pie plate, with an even overhang all around. Fold the edges and flute or crimp. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Press a piece of foil over the chilled crust, fill with pie weights, raw beans or rice. Bake to set the crust, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake until the crust is light brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Let cool slightly before adding the filling. Adjust the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the onion evenly into the crust. Combine the cheese, ham and spinach in a small bowl and sprinkle it in an even layer over the onion. Whisk together the half and half, parsley, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Pour the custard over the filling and bake until the quiche is set, 35 to 50 minutes.

Set aside. Combine the butter, shortening, brown sugar and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the egg, molasses and vanilla and beat on medium until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sifted flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined into a smooth dough, about 1 minute. Form the dough into a flat square, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until just firm, about 2 hours and up to overnight. Meanwhile, make templates for a gingerbread house. Gather several sheets of stiff paper; a manila folder works well. For the wall panels, cut a rectangle that measures 4 by 7 inches. For the front and back panels of a house with a peaked roof, cut a template that is 6 inches wide at the base, 4 inches to the roofline and 4 1/2 inches slanted to a peak. The template for the roof panels should measure 4 1/2 by 8 inches. Roll and cut the gingerbread: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap the dough and cut into 3 equal pieces (a pizza wheel is handy for this). Working with one piece of dough at a time and keeping the other pieces refrigerated, roll the dough into a rectangle 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Using the templates, cut out the front and back of the house and remove the scraps around the cutouts. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, cutting out 2 roof pieces and 2 side pieces. (If the dough gets too soft while rolling, return it to the refrigerator for 15 minutes before proceeding.) Discard the dough scraps or reroll to make cookies. Chill the dough pieces on the baking sheets for 15 minutes.<br> Bake the gingerbread: Bake the dough pieces until crisp almost all the way through (the very center will still be a little soft), 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the pans 10 minutes on a rack, then remove the house pieces to the rack to cool completely.

Add the onions and salt and sweat them until translucent, about 5 minutes. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Add the rice and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, letting the rice slightly stick to the bottom of the pan and scraping it off. It should also sound crackly. Add the saffron to the hot chicken stock; the stock should turn bright yellow. Add the wine to the pan until it covers the surface of the rice. Season with salt and cook over a medium-high heat, stirring continuously until the wine has absorbed into the rice. Add the saffron chicken stock to the pan until it covers the rice. Cook over a medium-high heat, stirring continuously until the stock has absorbed into the rice. Repeat this process two more times with the hot saffron chicken stock. When the third addition of the stock has absorbed and the rice is very creamy, bite a couple grains of rice to be sure it is cooked perfectly. If it is still a little crunchy, add a little more stock and cook the rice for another couple of minutes. When the rice is cooked perfectly, remove it from the heat. Toss in the butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano and \\whip the heck out of it.\\ The rice should be creamy but still flow and hold its own shape. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 13482,&quot;The Best Chicken Parmesan 2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 8 ounces each) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup plain breadcrumbs 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving 1/2 cup milk 1 large egg 1/2 cup plus 1/3 cup olive oil 3 cloves garlic, finely grated 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes Two 28-ounce cans diced tomatoes 3 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for serving 8 ounces whole milk mozzarella, shredded 12 ounces spaghetti Instructions: Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil. Cut two 12-inch sheets of plastic wrap. Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, making 4 roughly equal pieces; they should look like large chicken tenders. Place one sheet of plastic on a clean cutting board. Put one chicken piece in the center of the plastic and top with the other sheet of plastic. Pound the chicken with the flat side of a meat mallet, starting in the center and working your way to the edges, until the chicken is 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to the wire rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken, one piece at a time. Liberally sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put the flour in a pie plate and dredge the chicken 1 piece at a time, turning to coat and packing the flour into the crevices. Shake to remove any excess and return to the rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Whisk the breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Whisk the milk and egg in a medium bowl until combined. Dip the dredged chicken into the milk mixture, allowing any excess to drip off. Then pack the seasoned breadcrumbs firmly onto the chicken. Very gently shake off any excess and return to the rack. Refrigerate uncovered at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat 1/3 cup of the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes and cook until very fragrant but not brown, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the tomatoes are very tender and the liquid has reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Smash the tomatoes with a potato masher until almost smooth; it&#39;s ok if it&#39;s a little chunky. Season with salt. Heat the remaining 1/2 cup oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 cutlets and cook until the coating is golden brown, about 1 minute per side; the chicken will not be cooked through. Transfer to the foil-lined baking sheet in a single layer 3 inches apart. Repeat with the remaining cutlets. Arrange an oven rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, spaced 3 inches apart. Top each cutlet with 2/3 cup of the sauce and spread evenly to coat. Sprinkle each cutlet with 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan and 1/2 cup mozzarella.

For the mix-ins: Rinse the jujubes, then make a vertical incision in each with a paring knife and remove the pit by following the knife around it. Chop the jujubes and chestnuts into about 1/2-inch dice. Transfer to a bowl or plate and add the pine nuts; set aside. For the sauce: Whisk together the brown sugar, sesame oil, soy sauce, honey and 1 cup water in the insert of a 6-quart Instant Pot? until the sugar is melted and the mixture is homogeneous. Brush a 2-quart baking dish with sesame oil. Set aside the baking dish. Drain the rice over a mesh strainer, then transfer it to the insert and mix to combine with the sauce. Shake the insert side to side to level out the rice evenly in the sauce. Follow the manufacturer\\u2019s guide for locking the lid and set to pressure cook on the rice setting for 12 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for natural release. After 10 minutes, being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. Scrape up any stuck-on or browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon and stir to incorporate. Stir in the mix-ins, close the lid and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes for the jujubes to slightly soften and hydrate. Scrape the yaksik with a rubber spatula into the prepared baking dish and smooth out the top by pressing down slightly. For presentation purposes, dig out some of the mix-ins to decorate the surface. Let cool to room temperature, then cut into 10 rectangles. To decorate with the optional jujube \\flower\\ garnish: Make a vertical incision in each jujube with a paring knife and remove the pit by following the knife around it while keeping the jujube in one piece. Flatten the jujube and roll it up into a tight log like a jelly roll, then thinly slice. (If the jujubes are extremely dry and difficult to work with, place in a pot of boiling water, remove from the heat and cover. Let sit until softened but not soggy, with a bit of buoyancy, about 25 minutes.) Gently press each jujube \\flower\\ into the center of a yaksik bar, then press 5 to 6 pine nuts around each \\flower\\ to make \\petals.<br> Serve or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.

Cut or tear the peppers into long strips. Strain all the juices into a large non-reactive saucepan. Add the chili. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until the juices reduce to a heavy syrup and the chili is very soft, about 10 minutes. Scoop out the chili, seed if desired, and mince. Add the peppers and tomatoes to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in the chili and salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm or let cool to room temperature. Prepare the grill and let it burn down to medium coals. Season the flank steak with salt, pepper, 1 tsp. of the oregano, and brush with 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Grill, turning once, until done to your taste, about 10 minutes for rare meat. Transfer to a cutting board, drizzle with another 1 Tbs. of olive oil, and crumble the remaining 1/2-tsp. oregano over the top. Let rest for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, brush the bread on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the bread on both sides until brown and crunchy on the outside but still soft within. Carve the meat on the diagonal into thin slices and arrange on a platter or plates. Top each slice of grilled bread with about 1/4-cup of the roasted peppers in sauce and arrange next to the meat. (Reserve any remaining peppers for another use.) Gather all the meat juices (make an effort to scrape the meat juices off the carving board, too) into a small bowl and whisk in the vinegar and the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil. Drizzle over each portion.

Fill a small bowl with tap water and set it on your workstation. Place the flour in one small mixing bowl, the beaten egg in another and the Italian seasoning and salt in the third. If using panko, place it into a small food processor or a heavy-duty zip-top bag and pulse or crush into a slightly finer crumb. Add the breadcrumbs to the Italian seasoning and salt and mix well to combine. Lightly wet your hands with some of the tap water and scoop 1/4 cup of the prepared risotto into your hands. Flatten the risotto slightly and place a cube of mozzarella in the center. Wrap and pinch the risotto around the cheese to form a ball and fully enclose the cheese. Place the arancini ball onto the baking sheet or plate and continue with remaining risotto and cheese. Working with one at a time, toss the arancini in the flour followed by the egg, then roll in the breadcrumb mixture. Place back onto the baking sheet. Chill for 10 minutes. In a deep-sided, heavy-bottomed pan, heat 3 inches of canola oil over medium heat until it reaches 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or a small sprinkling of breadcrumbs into the oil bubbles and browns in about 5 to 10 seconds. Fry the arancini until deeply golden brown all around, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oil onto a sheet of paper towel and season immediately with the flaky sea salt. Quickly fry the whole sage leaves by adding to the hot oil for approximately 10 seconds, just until crisp, then drain on paper towel. Serve hot as is or with prepared tomato sauce, fried sage leaves and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Heat the broth over low in a medium saucepan. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Add the shallots, season with salt and cook just until translucent and lightly golden around the edges, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add in the arborio rice and cook for 1 minute while stirring continuously to toast the rice. Turn the heat down to medium low and add in the white wine. Stir until almost all of the wine has been absorbed then start adding the warm broth about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition and leaving it to bubble away until absorbed before adding and stirring in the next 1/2 cup of broth. Once the rice is tender, stir in the cheese, butter, if using, season with salt and black pepper and stir through any mix-ins to heat through. Serve immediately. Place any leftovers in a sealed container for up to 3 days to use for arancini. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 13489,&quot;Lemon Souffle 3/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon butter (melted) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 6 eggs, separated 2 lemons, zested then juiced Butter or shortening, for greasing Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Peel and core the apples and cut them into 1/4 to 1/2-inch dice. Try to get the apples pieces as uniform as possible to ensure even baking in the cobbler. Combine the apples with 1 cup of the sugar in a large bowl. Cover and set in the refrigerator while preparing the cobbler topping. The sugar will draw out some of the moisture in the apples, so the filling will be nice and thick. Combine the remaining sugar with the flour and salt in a medium size bowl. Set aside 1/2 cup of the sugar and flour mixture to coat the apples. Cut the chilled butter into small pieces and work into the sugar/flour mixture using a pastry cutter, a fork, or your fingers until it forms a coarse meal. Drain the sugar syrup from the apples and set aside. Combine the apples with the reserved flour and sugar mixture. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest, and sweetened dried cranberries to the apples and stir well to evenly distribute all the flavors. Pour into the buttered baking dish. Lightly beat the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla and slowly drizzle it into the flour mixture. Don&#39;t worry if it seems a little dry at first. Continue to stir the mixture until the flour is completely absorbed into the egg. (You might want to get your hands into it and use your fingers to finish.) Take a small bit of the topping and roll it into a 1-inch ball. Gently flatten the ball into a disk and place it on top of the apple mixture in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining topping, slightly overlapping the disks. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until the juices are bubbling and the topping is a light golden brown. Let the cobbler rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. While the cobbler is sitting, coat the almonds with the reserved sugar syrup. Drain off the excess syrup and place the almonds on a buttered parchment lined baking sheet. Roast until the almonds are golden brown, approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Scatter them over the cobbler. Tips: To make cutting the butter into the flour/sugar mixture a bit easier, try grating frozen sticks of butter on the large holes of a hand grater. You&#39;ll have small bits of cold butter which will help the coarse meal form quickly. Use a melon baller to scoop out the core of the apple halves quickly and with minimal waste. Note: You will need approximately 8 to 10 apples total. . &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 13494,&quot;Gabagool Sandwich 4 hoagie buns 4 ounces your favorite mayonnaise 1/2 head romaine lettuce, shredded 2 ounces Italian dressing 1 pound thin-sliced capocollo ham or as we call it, gabagool 4 ounces sliced Pickled Banana Peppers, recipe follows 8 slices white American cheese 4 ounces Company Sauce, recipe follows 6 banana peppers 12 ounces white vinegar 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons sugar 2 cloves garlic 1 bay leaf 3 eggs 4 ounces yellow mustard 1 1/2 ounces capers, strained 1 1/2 ounces white vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons celery salt 2 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons MSG 2 ounces lemon juice 15 ounces canola oil Instructions: Cut the hoagie buns in half lengthwise.

Reconstruct the Panettone by re-layering the slices of cake with the whipping cream and mixed fruit and juices equally in between all the layered pieces. Repeat until all the layers and cake have been reconstructed. Add any remaining juices and an optional splash of grappa on top. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vin Santo, Lambrusco]&quot; 13502,&quot;My Mother&#39;s Chicken with Barbeque Sauce 3 cups ketchup 2 cups cider vinegar 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup light soy sauce 1 cup light brown sugar 1 cup dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons dry mustard (preferably Colman&#39;s) 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 cup chili powder 1 \\knob\\ fresh ginger (about 4 inches), peeled and cut in 3 pieces 5 large cloves garlic, roughly chopped 2 lemons, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices 4 to 5 pounds chicken parts, a mixture of light and dark meat, all relatively the same size 4 to 5 pounds chicken parts, a mixture of light and dark meat, all relatively the same size<br> Kosher salt Instructions: Prepare the barbeque sauce:<br> In a medium saucepan or a large high-sided saute pan, combine the ketchup, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, light brown sugar, dark brown sugar, dry mustard, Dijon mustard and chili powder. Whisk to blend. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the ginger, garlic and lemon slices and stir to combine. Simmer until the vinegar mellows slightly and the flavors start to meld together, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Discard the ginger pieces.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position the rack in the lower third of the oven. Line a baking sheet (or, if needed, 2 baking sheets) with foil. Season the chicken parts on both sides with salt, to taste. Pour about 1 1/2 cups of the barbeque sauce into a large bowl. Reserve the remaining sauce on the side. Submerge the chicken pieces in the sauce and arrange them on the prepared baking sheet with some of the lemon slices. The chicken should all be in a single layer with a little space between them. If additional space is needed, use the second baking sheet. Brush with barbeque sauce.<br> Put the baking sheet(s) in the oven and bake, undisturbed, for 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and use a pair of metal tings to turn the pieces to the other side. Use a pastry brush to coat the second side of the chicken with the barbeque sauce from the bowl. Do not reuse that bowl or brush again. Return the sheet(s) to the oven and cook for an additional 15 to 20 minutes. Poke a thigh with the tip of a small knife and verify the chicken juices run \\clear\\ and not pink. Turn the broiler on and broil for a minute until the chicken is charred on top.<br> Warm the reserved barbeque sauce in a small saucepan over low heat.

Drain and return to the pot to allow the water to cook off, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saute pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the diced onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and saute for 1 minute more. Add the spinach and cook for 3 minutes. Add the wine and cook until the spinach is wilted, 5 minutes, stirring often. Place the mixture in a strainer set over a bowl to catch the liquids as it drains off, applying pressure gently a few times to accelerate liquid removal. Reserve 1/2 cup liquid. When the potatoes are dry and slightly cooled, roughly cut them and pass through a food mill or ricer. Set aside. (Guy&#39;s tip: after ricing the potatoes, spread them out on a baking sheet and allow them to dry out even more to remove moisture). In a food processor bowl fitted with the bottom blade, add the strained spinach, pulse to puree, and then add the egg and egg yolk, flour, nutmeg, and Parmesan. Pulse until well mixed. Place into a large bowl and gently fold in the riced potatoes, gently stirring until just combined. You will have very soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured board and roll into a 1 1/2-inch thick snake. Dust the dough lightly with flour and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Roll each piece gently with your thumb, leaving a small indentation on 1 side of the gnocchi. Place the finished gnocchi on a lightly floured, parchment paper-lined baking sheet. (Guy&#39;s tip: if you have time, let the gnocchi rest in the refrigerator or freezer until chilled prior to cooking. It will help the gnocchi hold its shape better). Fill a large stock pot 3/4 full with water, place over high heat, add 1 tablespoon kosher salt, and bring to a rapid boil. Meanwhile, for the sauce: Wipe clean the same pan that the spinach was cooked in and place over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons butter and melt. Add the garlic and cl flakes and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Deglaze with the wine, reduce for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the stock, reserved spinach liquid, half-and-half, and cheese and reduce an additional 3 minutes. Add the pepper, tomatoes, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. When the sauce is ready, add the gnocchi to the boiling water and cook for 3 1/2 minutes. Remove, drain, and let rest for 5 minutes. Add to the sauce and garnish with Parmesan and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Freeze any leftover gnocchi for a later meal. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 13506,&quot;Tropical Honeymoon Cupcakes 1/2 cup cream of coconut, stirred before measuring 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 egg whites, lightly beaten 1 egg 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut, coarsely ground in a food processor 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into tablespoons 1 1/4 cups thick mango juice 2 egg yolks 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon granulated sugar Pinch kosher salt One 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) butter, softened 2 to 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 12 thin squares fresh pineapple Granulated sugar, for sprinkling 3/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut Instructions: For the coconut cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners. Whisk 1/4 cup water, the cream of coconut, coconut extract, vanilla extract, egg whites and egg in a large bowl until combined. Mix the flour, shredded coconut, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until combined, about 15 seconds. Add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, continuing to beat on low speed until the mixture forms a ball, about 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and add half the cream of coconut mixture. Beat on low speed until the flour mixture is moistened, about 15 seconds. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat until the batter is light and fluffy, about 45 seconds. With the mixer still running, slowly add the remaining cream of coconut mixture. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat on medium speed for 30 seconds. Fill the muffin cups two-thirds full with batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers of cupcakes comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before filling and frosting. For the mango filling: Whisk 1/4 cup juice, egg yolks and cornstarch until smooth in a small bowl. Boil the remaining 1 cup juice, granulated sugar and salt over medium-high heat in a saucepan. Slowly add half the hot liquid to the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Add the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the filling thickens and boils, stirring constantly. Strain the filling through a fine mesh sieve. Cool the filling before assembling the cupcakes. Yield: about 1 1/4 cups. For the orange cream cheese icing: Beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, to desired consistency. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Beat in the orange zest and vanilla extract until fully incorporated. Yield: 3 cups. For the garnish: Generously sprinkle the pineapple with sugar. Use a blow torch to caramelize the pineapple, or broil in the oven on low for 1 to 2 minutes, watching carefully so the sugar does not burn. Cool the pineapple before assembling the cupcakes. Cook the sweetened flaked coconut in a dry saute pan over low heat, stirring often, until the coconut browns slightly and smells fragrant. Cool the coconut before assembling the cupcakes. To assemble: Dig a small hole inside each of the cupcakes using a teaspoon. Fill each hole with the mango filing. Top with the orange cream cheese icing. Garnish with the caramelized pineapple and toasted coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 13507,&quot;Almond Biscotti: Quaresimale 1 cup white sugar 1 cup brown sugar 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon 3 tablespoons soft unsalted butter 3 cups whole almonds (skin on) 2 beaten eggs 3 tablespoons pure vanilla 1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Remove the bowl from the pan and beat with a mixer on high speed until stiff, shiny peaks form, about 5 minutes. Beat in the butter a few pieces at a time, then continue beating until smooth. (Don&#39;t worry if the mixture looks separated at first; keep beating and it will come together.) Beat in the maple extract. Assemble the cake: Poke holes all over the tops of the 2 cake layers using a toothpick. Spoon the reserved walnut syrup over the cakes, letting it soak into the holes. Coarsely chop the walnuts. Transfer 1 cup frosting to a medium bowl; fold in the chopped nuts. Put 1 cake layer on a platter and spread the walnut frosting on top. Top with the second cake layer. Cover the whole cake with the remaining maple frosting. Decorate with more walnuts. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

After you have rolled the pasta out into sheets, cut the sheet into an even amount of squares. Using a teaspoon fill the center of half with the filling. Brush around the filling with the egg wash and place the remaining squares on top. Press down around the seal to push out any air bubbles. In half a gallon of rapidly boiling salted water add the ravioli in batches. Remove to a strainer. In a separate pan over medium heat place the butter until it just starts to brown. Toss in 10 ravioli until coated. Sprinkle in the sage and toss again to evenly distribute. In a food processor bowl, combine croutons, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and thyme. Pulse until the mixture is of a fine texture. Place this mixture into a large bowl. Combine the onion, carrot, garlic, and red pepper in the food processor bowl. Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped, but not pureed. Combine the vegetable mixture, ground sirloin, and ground chuck with the bread crumb mixture. Season the meat mixture with the kosher salt. Add the egg and combine thoroughly, but avoid squeezing the meat. By Hand: On a clean surface make a well with the flour. In a measuring cup mix the eggs, water and oil and salt. Pour the wet mixture slowly into the flour and mix with your 2 fingers until all of the wet is incorporated. Do not force the dough to take all of the flour. If you are going to use a pasta machine to roll out the dough you may at this point form the dough into a disk and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to rest. If you going to roll this by hand you should knead the dough on a floured work surface for 8 to 10 minutes. By Food Processor: In the bowl of your food processor combine the flour and salt and pulse 2 to 3 times. In a liquid measuring cup whisk the eggs, water and oil. While pulsing the machine pour this mixture in a continuous stream and continue running the machine until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Follow directions above for hand rolling or machine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 13529,&quot;Amaretto Stinger 1 1/2 -ounce Amaretto 3/4-ounce white Creme de Menthe Whole almonds, for garnish Instructions: Fill a cocktail shaker half full of ice cubes.

To make bread crumbs: Trim the crust off the bread and discard, tear bread into pieces. Spread bread out on a microwave-safe plate, and microwave on HIGH for 1 minute to dry out the bread. (Alternately, spread the bread out on a baking sheet and dry in a preheated 300 degree F oven for 22 to 25 minutes.) Pulse the dried bread or crumbs in a food processor with the thyme, lemon zest, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. With the flat side of a cook&#39;s knife or the smooth side of a meat-pounder, pound each breast to equal thickness. Put the flour, eggs, and the bread crumbs each separately in 3 shallow dishes. Pat the chicken dry and season both sides with salt and pepper. Dip each breast into the flour, then shake off the excess. Next, run the breast through the egg to coat it lightly and hold the chicken over the liquid to let any excess fall back into the bowl. Finally, lay the chicken in the bread crumbs, turn it over and press it into the breading to coat. Lay on a piece of waxed paper. Heat a large skillet (12 inches in diameter) over medium heat. Add the oil. Lay 2 chicken breasts smooth-side down in the pan. Cook the chicken without turning until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes.

Brush some olive oil over a baking tray large enough to hold the salmon slices in 1 layer and arrange the salmon on the pan. Roast until medium, about 10 minutes. The salmon should be cooked on the outside, but still moist and slightly underdone on the inside. Divide the sauce among 4 warm dinner plates. Spoon equal amounts of celery root puree in the center of each plate and place 1 piece of salmon on top. Place the chicken bones in a 6-quart pot, pour water over to cover and bring to a rolling boil. Skim off the scum that collects on the top. Add the remaining ingredients, lower the flame, and simmer about 2 hours, skimming as necessary. Strain into a clean bowl and cool. Refrigerate in a container for up to 3 days, discarding the hardened layer of fat before using or freezing. Yield: about 2 quarts Place the celery root and potato in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Season with salt and cook until soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the water and return the celery and potato to the pan. Pour in the cream and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until thickened and most of the cream is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the butter, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Puree in a food mill, return to the pan, and keep warm over simmering water. Use as needed.

Place on top of the filling. Trim off 1-inch beyond the edge of the pie plate. Crimp the edges as desired. Cut slits to allow steam to escape when baking. Sprinkle a little sugar and cinnamon over the pie. Cover the edges with foil to prevent over browning. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is golden brown. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. In a medium bowl combine the apples, with the brown and white sugar. Add flour, cinnamon and continue mixing until they are well coated. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 13565,&quot;Coconut Chocolate Tarts 2 16-ounce bags almond flour 1 12-ounce jar coconut oil, melted<br> 12 fluid ounces honey<br> 4 14-ounce cans coconut milk<br> 1 tablespoon ancho cl powder<br> 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 tablespoon pasilla cl powder<br> 1 tablespoon smoked sea salt<br> 48 ounces dark chocolate chips or chunks<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the onions and saute until soft and browned, 4 minutes. Stir in the guava paste, brown sugar, allspice, curry powder, orange juice, lime juice and vinegar. Cook over low heat until the guava paste has melted, about 15 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat, cool slightly, and then transfer to a blender and puree until completely smooth. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Set the oven racks at the upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper and set aside. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the chorizo and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until it is completely cooked through, about 6 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool slightly. Put the chorizo on a cutting board and chop it up into small pieces, transfer to a mixing bowl. Crumble the white bread into the chorizo and mix well to combine. Dust your work surface with flour and place 1 thawed puff pastry sheet on top, with a long edge towards you. Cut the pastry in half lengthwise, giving you 2 long strips, and then cut each strip into 3 squares. Put a heaping tablespoon of the chorizo mixture in the center of the pastry square. Brush the edge closest to you with egg wash, and, starting at the opposite edge, roll the pastry over itself to enclose the filling, turning it onto the egg-brushed edge to seal. (If at any time the pastry gets too warm and hard to handle, place it on the baking sheet and in the freezer for a few minutes to chill quickly.) Place the chorizo rolls, seam side down, on the prepared baking pan. Flatten the rolls slightly with the palm of your hand. With the tip of a knife, slash the top of the pastry 3 times. Repeat the process with the remaining sheet of puff pastry and chorizo filling. Brush the chorizo rolls with egg wash. Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for a couple of minutes and serve warm with guachup on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 13570,&quot;Piquillo Peppers Stuffed with Spicy Salmon Tartar with Lemon Oil 1 1/2 pounds salmon, cut into 1/4-inch dice 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons pureed canned chipotles 1/4 cup capers, drained 1/4 cup finely chopped scallions 2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro 2 tablespoons olive oil 16 roasted piquillo peppers 2 tablespoons lemon oil 1 cup olive oil, divided Zest of 2 lemons Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl.

Serve immediately with celery sticks, ranch dressing and the remaining Buffalo sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 13589,&quot;Sauce Espagnole 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 small carrot, chopped 1 stalk celery, chopped 1 small yellow onion, chopped 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1/2 cup dry white wine 8 cups good-quality low- or no-sodium brown stock, such as veal or beef stock 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 dried bay leaves Instructions: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour to make a smooth paste. Cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon and lowering the heat as needed to prevent burning, until the roux is several shades darker than peanut butter, 18 to 20 minutes. Stir in the carrots, celery and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, then whisk in the white wine and cook until the mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Don\\u2019t worry if the vegetables get stuck in the whisk; as you add more liquid, they will release and combine with the sauce. Whisk in the stock, 1 cup at a time, and lower the heat to a simmer. To make a bouquet garni, place the peppercorns, parsley, thyme and bay leaves and in a square of cheesecloth and tie it into a bundle with kitchen twine. Submerge the bouquet garni in the sauce. Simmer the sauce, using a spoon to skim off any fat or scum that rises to the surface, until it reduces by half and has the consistency of gravy, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the bouquet garni, then strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth. Use as desired as a base for sauces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 13590,&quot;Corn and Bean Medley 6 slices thick-cut bacon, diced 1 large red onion, chopped 2 teaspoons minced garlic 4 ears of corn, kernels and milk scraped from cobs (about 3 cups) 1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 teaspoons salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cups cooked pinto beans, drained (cooked until just tender)* 2 cups cooked navy or cannellini beans, drained (cooked until just tender)* 2 cups cooked black beans, drained (cooked until just tender)* 2 cups chicken stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth 1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions Instructions: In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, saute the bacon until very crispy and all of the fat is rendered, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the bacon using a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper-lined plate to drain. Set aside. Remove all but 1/4 cup of the bacon drippings from the pan and save for another use. To the hot bacon drippings add the onion and cook until lightly caramelized, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring. Add the corn, thyme, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the beans, remaining teaspoon of salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the stock, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to a brisk simmer. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is almost completely reduced, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the green onions, stir to combine, then cover and remove from the heat. Let sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally, to allow flavors to marry. Reheat slowly, if necessary, before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 13591,&quot;Pork Tenderloin with Rum-Molasses Glaze and Grilled Pineapple-Jalapeno Sauce 1 small pineapple, peeled, cored and quartered Canola oil Salt and pepper 1 to 2 jalapeno peppers (depending on how spicy you like it), seeded and chopped 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves Honey 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 small red onion, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 cup dark rum 4 cups chicken stock 3 tablespoons molasses 2 tablespoons dark brown muscovado sugar 1 habanero cl, halved 2 cinnamon sticks 2 star anise Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon coarse black pepper 1 1/2 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed of excess fat Green onion, thinly sliced, for garnish Cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: For Grilled Pineapple-Jalapeno Sauce: Heat grill to high. Brush pineapple with a few tablespoons of oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown on all sides. Remove pineapple from the grill, coarsely chop and transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Add the jalapeno, vinegar, coconut milk, cilantro, and few tablespoons of oil and honey, to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving. For Rum-Molasses Glaze: Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the rum and cook until reduced by half. Add the stock, molasses, sugar, habanero, cinnamon sticks, and star anise. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cook until reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Strain the mixture into a bowl then return it to the saucepan and continue cooking until reduced by half and thickened to a glaze. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture into a bowl and let cool to room temperature. For Tenderloin: Heat grill to high. Brush the tenderloin with 2 tablespoons of oil and season with salt and pepper.

Stir in remaining water. In large bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with dough hook whisk together 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, and salt. With mixer on low speed stir in yeast mixture and blend until mixture forms dough. With mixer on medium speed knead dough, adding enough of remaining 1 cup flour as necessary to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Put dough in an oiled deep bowl and turn to coat with oil. Let dough rise, loosely covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk, and punch down. Divide dough into 6 balls. On a lightly floured surface roll out each ball of dough into a 9 1/2-inch round and stack, lightly floured, between sheets of parchment paper. Dough may be made 8 hours ahead and chilled, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 550 degrees F. Spread 1 cup robiola on each round of dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border around the edge. Place another piece of thin, rolled out dough on top. Dock pizza all over so cheese can ooze through. Sprinkle 1-tablespoon semolina on each of 2 baking sheets and transfer 1 pizza to each. Bake in batches in lower third of oven 10 minutes, or until crust is crisp and golden. Transfer pizzas to plates and drizzle each with 1-tablespoon truffle oil and shaved truffles. Top and bake remaining pizzas in the same manner. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 13593,&quot;Potato, Leek, and Bacon Ravioli 3/4 pound Yukon gold potatoes (3 small potatoes are best) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 cup bacon, cut crosswise in 1/4-inch strips (about 5 ounces) 1 1/2 cups finely chopped leeks, washed and drained (2 medium leeks) 1/8 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padano, for the filling Fresh pasta dough Small Shrimp and Scallion Sauce, recipe follows 1/3 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 2 tablespoons soft butter 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padano 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup sliced garlic (7 or 8 fat garlic cloves) About 12 whole Tuscan-style pepperoncini in vinegar, drained, seeded and thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup) 1 pound (about 2 dozen) small shrimp, washed, peeled and deveined 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions 2 tablespoons soft butter Instructions: Preparing the Filling: Cook the whole, unpeeled potatoes in a pot of unsalted water to cover at a steady boil for 20 minutes or longer until just cooked through. Don&#39;t let them crack or get mushy on the outside. Let them cool briefly, then peel and slice them into rounds, 1/4-inch thick. Heat the oil and the bacon pieces in a skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 or 4 minutes until the bacon is sizzling and has rendered much of its fat. Stir in the leeks and cook another 3 minutes or so until they&#39;re wilted and sizzling. Spread the potato slices in the pan, season with salt and pepper and toss with the bacon and leeks. Cook for 8 minutes or more over medium-high heat, breaking up the potatoes into chunks. Spread and press the filling flat in the pan and let caramelize for a couple of minutes. Turn the pieces, press and fry, then repeat. When the filling is thoroughly cooked and has started to color, scrape it into a mixing bowl. Cool briefly then crush the potatoes some more with a fork (I like to have little chunks left); add 1/2 cup Parmesan and salt and pepper, to taste. Filling the Ravioli: Roll out fresh pasta dough. For each ravioli, scoop up a heaping tablespoon of potato filling, shape it round and set in place. Cover and cut ravioli. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. If you are using dry pasta, start cooking the pasta 5 minutes before you start the sauce; if you are using fresh, start the sauce and then put on the pasta to cook at the same time When the pasta is done al dente, scoop it up and drop into the shrimp pan. Toss briefly, sprinkle on the parsley, and toss again. Remove from the heat and drop 2 tablespoons butter on top of the pasta and toss in. Serve right away sprinkled with Parmesan. Hot water from the pasta cooking pot Pour the olive oil into the big skillet, scatter the garlic slices in and set over medium-high heat. Cook for 1 minute, until the garlic is sizzling. Scatter the slices of pepperoncini in a hot spot; cook for 1 minute; shake the pan now and then. Push the garlic and peppers to the side, turn the heat to high. Drop the shrimp in the center of the skillet and spread them so they&#39;re not crowded. Sprinkle on the salt and let them sizzle for 1/2 minute. Flip the shrimp over, giving the skillet a good toss or stirring and turning them; and cook another 1/2 minute or so, until the flesh is just turning opaque. Scatter the scallions into the skillet; toss and stir in with the shrimp, for 20 to 30 seconds, just until they are sizzling. Stir in butter 2 tablespoons of butter and cook until it is melted and starts to simmer, 10 to 20 seconds. Ladle in 2 cups of boiling pasta water. Stir up everything in the skillet and let the sauce boil for only a moment. If the pasta is ready to add turn down the heat to very low. If the pasta is not ready, remove the skillet from the heat immediately; set it back over low heat when you do add the pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 13594,&quot;Goat Cheese Quiche with Prosciutto Quiche Pastry 2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted Salt 8 ounces (2 sticks) cold butter, cubed 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water Quiche Filling 3 large shallots, halved, skins on 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cups 2-percent milk 3 eggs, at room temperature 4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces (1/2 cup) goat cheese, crumbled 2 cups baby arugula 6 pieces thinly sliced prosciutto Instructions: For the quiche pastry: In a large bowl, put the flour, salt, and butter cubes. Using the tips of your fingers, mix the ingredients until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Add the ice water a little at a time until the dough just comes together. Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a disk. Cover the disk with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly flour the work surface, roll-out the dough and put in a pan with a removable bottom. Allow the dough to hang over the edges. Trim the edges slightly, still leaving an overhang of dough. Poke or dock the bottom of the pastry with a fork. Put the crust on a baking tray and cover the bottom of the pastry dough with aluminum foil. Fill the crust with dried beans or pastry weights and bake for approximately 15 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and beans, and then put the pastry back in the oven until the bottom is golden brown, approximately 10 minutes. Remove the pastry crust from the oven. While the pastry is still hot, brush a thin layer of quiche egg mixture over the bottom to seal. For the quiche filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the shallots in a small saute pan skin-side up and coat with olive oil. Season the shallots with salt and roast for 30 minutes, until tender. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Peel the skins from the shallots and set the shallots aside. Put the milk in a pot over low heat until scalded, set aside. In a bowl, whisk the eggs, thyme, salt, and pepper until incorporated. Slowly whisk the warm milk into the egg mixture. Scatter the roasted shallots and goat cheese into the base of the pastry crust. Pour the egg mixture into the prepared quiche pastry crust. Bake in the oven for approximately 20 to 30 minutes, until the custard has set. Remove the quiche from the oven and allow to cool. Slice the quiche into portions and put the arugula and prosciutto over the quiche. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 13595,&quot;Sammy&#39;s Italian Meatballs 1 large yellow onion, diced 1 tablespoon canola oil<br> 5 pounds Italian ground sausage<br> 5 pounds ground beef, 80/20 blend<br> 2 cups breadcrumbs<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream<br> 1 cup shredded asiago cheese<br> 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard<br> 2 tablespoons dried oregano<br> 2 tablespoons dried thyme<br> 4 eggs<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Serving suggestions: marinara sauce, spaghetti and/or sub roll Instructions: In a saute pan over medium-high heat, cook the diced onions and canola oil until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.

For the wet mop: Combine the apple cider vinegar, liquid smoke and 2 cups water in a large bowl. Rub the pork with the spice rub and place on the rack. Pour the wet mop over the top and cover the roasting pan with 2 layers of aluminum foil. Roast the pork until it shreds easily in numerous places, approximately 6 hours. Shred the pork and toss it with the Barbecue Sauce. (The mixture will keep up to a week in airtight containers in the fridge and up to 3 months in the freezer.) Increase the oven heat to 450 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. For the rollups: Roll out one of the balls of pizza dough into an 18-by-9-inch rectangle. Lay the shredded pork mixture (about 1 pound) in the center of the rectangle, leaving about a 1-inch border. Sprinkle 2 cups of the gouda over top. Starting on the long side, roll the pizza dough up so that you have a long spiral about 2- to 3-inches thick and 18 inches long. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Bake the rolls on the prepared baking sheets, in batches if necessary, until cooked through, 13 to 15 minutes. Slice into rounds about 1/3-inch thick and serve warm. Each roll should yield about 50 pork and cheese rounds. Cook the onion in the oil in a large pot over medium heat until translucent. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Add the tomatoes and chipotle peppers, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the flavors meld, about 15 minutes.

Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes at a strong simmer for 20 minutes or until tender. Drain the water from the pot and let the potatoes cool for only a few minutes before you begin to pull the skins from the potatoes. Discard the potato skins and, while still hot, pass the potatoes through a ricer into a bowl. To the riced potatoes add the spinach and mix well. Add the eggs, one at a time, and incorporate well. Add the flour in two stages so that only the amount that is necessary will be used to bind the potato. Add the second half of the flour (and have some additional flour available if necessary) and mix well to form a dough. Divide the dough in half, and on a floured work surface, roll the first half of dough into a log 1-inch thick. Cut the log into 1/2-inch thick round pieces. Lay the pieces out, and the back of a fork or your thumb, make an indentation on one side. Set aside and refrigerate until needed. Cook as you would pasta in several quarts of boiling water for 10 to 15 seconds. They cook very quickly and are cooked when they float to the surface.

Arrange the leaves on a very large platter or cutting board in a Christmas tree shape that measures 16 to 18 inches tall, reserving a handful of greens. The platter should be large enough to accommodate a star on top and a trunk on the bottom. Scatter half of the sliced cucumbers over the tree. Arrange a layer of little gem lettuce leaves to create 4 tiers on the tree; use the small inner leaves for the fourth layer at the top of the tree. Stack the sliced salami and cut out a large star using a 3 1/2-inch star cutter; reserve the scraps. Using the same cutter, cut out 2 stars from 2 slices of the provolone; reserve the scraps. Make a layered meat-and-cheese stack starting with half the salami stars, topped with a provolone star, the rest of the salami, and the second provolone star. Place the star at the top of the tree.<br> Cut out smaller stars from the provolone scraps and the remaining provolone slice using 1-inch and 1 1/2-inch cutters. Roll up the salami scraps and prosciutto slices into flowers. Arrange the cheese stars, meat flowers, stuffed peppadews, artichoke hearts, both kinds of olives and pepperoncini on the lettuce to form a garland that zig-zags up the tree from the bottom right to the upper left.<br> Using a bar citrus zester, zest a channel along the equator of each radish so it resembles a tree ornament. Halve each radish vertically and add the pieces to the garland. Scatter the remaining cucumber slices on the leafy parts of the tree and use the reserved greens to fill any gaps in the tree. Put the nuts on a small plate and roll the goat cheese in them to fully coat. Place the log at the bottom of the tree to form the trunk.

Cover the bottom of a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Rinse the pears, pat dry and put on a baking sheet. Cover with additional foil and roast the pears for 1 hour. Peel the pears and cut them in half. On a cutting board, cut out 12 circles from the pear halves, using a 1/2-inch circle cutter. Avoid the seeds. Shave off excess pear to make sure all of the circles are the same height. I suggest you make them a 1/2-inch high. Put the pear circles into large serving spoons. Pour some Champagne over the pears and sprinkle with cinnamon. Arrange some diced cucumber on top of each pear circle and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 13609,&quot;Lasagne Alla Bolognese Butter, for the pan 1/2 batch Bolognese Sauce, recipe follows 1 1/2 (9-ounce) boxes no-boil lasagne noodles Besciamella, recipe follows 3/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving 1 pound ground pork 1 pound ground veal 5 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup red wine 1 red onion, medium chop 3 (28-ounce) cans pelati tomatoes* (See Cook&#39;s Notes) 3 carrots, medium chop 3 celery stalks, medium chop 5 ounces pancetta, cut into small cubes 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and chopped<br> 1 pound ground beef Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup whole milk 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 4 1/2 cups whole milk Pinch freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter the lasagne pan well and add a very thin layer of meat sauce. Add the first layer of lasagne noodles and in order, cover with meat sauce, about 3 ladles besciamella, and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Repeat the same process until you reach the top of the dish. Make sure the lasagne noodles are soaking into the sauce. When done layering the ingredients, top the lasagne with a final ladle of meat sauce and some besciamella, add a few thin slices of butter and finish with some grated Parmesan. Bake for about 30 minutes. Heat a broiler. When your fantastic lasagne alla bolognese is cooked, give it a nice crisp top by broiling it for about 5 minutes. Always serve this dish with extra-virgin olive oil and some grated parmesan, to taste. Bolognese Sauce: Saute the onion, carrots, and celery in about 5 tablespoons olive oil in a large rondeau until soft. Add the pancetta to the soffritto (onion mixture). Cook on a medium-high flame for about 7 to 10 minutes, then add the meat; break it up well with a wooden spoon. You can jack up the heat a bit, and keep stirring until all the ground meat is browned. Add the red pepper flakes and the parsley and cook for just 1 minute. Add the wine now and cook until the alcohol is completely evaporated, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.<br> Pulse the tomatoes smooth in a food processor and add them to the meat, season generously with salt and pepper, lower the flame to medium and cook for about 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Finish the sauce by adding the whole milk, stir well and set aside, to cool off. Besciamella: Melt the 1/2 cup butter in a pan over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. This is an important moment, as you have to slowly toast the flour without burning it. This will help you lose the flowery taste.<br> Warm up the milk and gradually ladle into the pot with the butter-flour mixture, whisking constantly while bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Season the sauce with freshly grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 13610,&quot;Chocolate Mousse with Blackberry Sauce 8 ounces dark chocolate pastilles, such as Valrhona Manjari 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder<br> 12 ounces heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 3 large egg whites, at room temperature<br> Blackberry Sauce, recipe follows Grated dark chocolate, for garnish<br> Whipped cream, optional, for serving<br> 1 pint fresh blackberries 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 2 tablespoons blackberry liqueur<br> Instructions: Melt the chocolate in a double boiler at a low simmer, stirring occasionally. Add the espresso powder and mix to combine. Remove from the heat and let cool until cool to the touch, about 10 minutes. Whip the cream, sugar and vanilla to soft peaks in a large bowl, then let sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whip the egg whites in a separate large bowl until they hold soft peaks. Set aside. Take a large spoonful of the egg whites and mix into the chocolate mixture to lighten. Gently fold the remaining egg whites in. Fold in the whipped cream until no white streaks appear. Divide among glasses or bowls. Top with Blackberry Sauce, grated chocolate and whipped cream, if using. Combine the blackberries, sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to boil, then lower to a simmer and cook until the berries soften and break down, about 10 minutes. Mash the berries with the back of a spoon or a potato masher. Add the liqueur and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Strain through a mesh sieve. Let cool slightly before using. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Moscato, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 13611,&quot;Red Wine and Port Poached Pears with Mascarpone 1 1/2 cups ruby port 1 1/2 cups red wine 1 1/4 cups sugar 2 star anise 2 cinnamon sticks 1 bundle thyme 1 lemon, zested, not grated, but in big strips for easy removal 1/2 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 3 Bosc pears, peeled, halved and cored 1 pint mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 1/4 pound block semisweet or dark chocolate, to shave with a vegetable peeler Instructions: In a large saucepan combine the port, wine, 1 cup of the sugar, star anise, cinnamon, thyme, lemon zest, the vanilla bean and seeds. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the pears and simmer until the pears are cooked through, about 25 to 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool in the poaching liquid. Before serving, remove the pears from their poaching liquid and reduce the liquid to a syrup. Strain into a small bowl. Combine the mascarpone and remaining sugar in a small bowl. Dollop a small amount of the mascarpone on each plate and arrange a pear half on top to prevent it from sliding around the plate. Garnish the pears with a large dollop of the mascarpone, and drizzle with the reduced poaching liquid. Shave the chocolate over the mascarpone and serve. Voila! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Rioja]&quot; 13612,&quot;Earl Grey-Spiked Chocolate Truffles 1 1/2 cups creme fraiche or sour cream 2 tablespoons Earl Grey tea leaves 12 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped with a heavy knife 1 1/2 pounds semisweet chocolate 1 1/2 cups unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder Instructions: In a saucepan, combine the creme fraiche and tea and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as it boils, turn off the heat. Meanwhile, put the chopped bittersweet chocolate in a medium bowl. Strain the hot creme fraiche mixture into the bowl. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Cover and let rest in a cool place overnight. The mixture will become firm but not hard. The next day, using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip, pipe bite-size \\kisses\\ (like Hershey&#39;s Kisses) of the mixture onto parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Refrigerate briefly just until set, about 30 minutes. Use your palm to gently press down the point that sticks up on each truffle. Transfer to the freezer and freeze until hard, 2 to 3 hours or overnight. In the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the semisweet chocolate. It should be liquid, but not so hot that you can&#39;t touch it; if it is too hot for you, wear disposable surgical gloves. Spread the cocoa powder out on a sheet pan with sides. Working in 2 batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan of cocoa, dip the frozen truffle centers 1 at a time into the melted chocolate, shake off any excess, and set them down in the cocoa. When all the truffle centers are dipped and the chocolate has started to set, gently but thoroughly shake the sheet pan to roll the truffles around in the cocoa until coated. Carefully remove to another sheet pan and refrigerate, uncovered, 30 minutes. (You can sift the unused cocoa and use it for another purpose.) Transfer to an airtight container and keep chilled until almost ready to serve. Bring to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 13613,&quot;Warm Grape Cake 1/2 stick unsalted butter, plus extra for pan, softened 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 eggs, at room temperature 1 lemon, zested 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus 1 tablespoon, sifted, divided 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup whole milk, room temperature 1/3 cup golden raisins 1 1/2 cups fresh seedless grapes, stemmed, washed, dried and halved, divided 1 cup heavy cream, cold 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 3 tablespoons to 1/4 cup honey 1 small ginger knob, peeled and grated, about 1 heaping tablespoon Instructions: This cake is very simple to put together but you have to respect 1 rule: temperature. It is critical that the butter, eggs, milk and olive oil all be at room temperature when you begin making this batter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric hand mixer, beat together the butter and sugar in a large bowl until they lighten in color, about 5 to 8 minutes. Slowly beat in the eggs and lemon zest. Sift 1 1/2 cups flour over the bowl and add the baking powder and salt, gently folding to combine. Add in the olive oil and milk, stirring to combine. In a separate bowl, toss the raisins and about 1 cup of the grapes with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sifted flour. Add the fruit to the cake batter and stir only enough to blend. Thoroughly grease the bottom and sides of the cake pan with some extra softened butter. Pour the batter into the pan and slide it into the center of the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool. Detach the outside of the springform pan, using the bottom as a plate for the cake to finish cooling. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and almond extract until soft peaks form. Set the topping aside. Add the honey to a small saute pan and bring it to a light simmer over low heat. Once it bubbles, thickens and turns light brown after about 2 to 3 minutes, add in the grated ginger and remaining grapes. Switch off the heat and allow the glaze to cool. Serve slices of the cake with some of the grape-ginger mixture spooned over and a dollop of the whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 13614,&quot;Second Time Around Veal Stew \\Normandy Style<br> 2 tablespoons butter 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2 inch dice 1/2 cup apple cider 1/2 veal stew from above 4 kirby cucumbers, seeded and diced into 3/4 inch cross pieces 1/4 cup cream, optional Instructions: Saute apple in butter until almost tender.

Add the onions and garlic and saute until tender. Add the chili powder, coriander, cumin, dry mustard and cayenne, and saute for 2 minutes while stirring to toast the spices. Deglaze the pan with the vinegar and wine. Whisk in the ketchup and bring the sauce to a boil and add half of the blueberries. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the sauce for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to avoid burning. Puree the sauce with an immersion blender, and then add the remaining blueberries. Simmer for another 5 minutes and keep warm for plating. For the cornbread cakes: In a mixing bowl combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt and baking soda, and stir to combine. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, butter and egg, and whisk. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Rest the batter for 30 minutes. On a skillet set over medium-high heat, heat some oil and pour silver-dollar-size portions of the batter on the skillet. Allow the cakes to cook until golden brown on the first side, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook to golden brown on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the skillet to a paper-towel-lined pate to absorb any grease. For the carrots: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F with a large saute pan or a baking sheet in it. In a bowl, toss the carrots with the oil, salt and pepper. Remove the hot pan from the oven and spread the carrots onto the pan. The carrots should sizzle when they hit the pan. Quickly place the pan back in the oven and cook until the carrots are tender, about 15 minutes. For plating: Heat a skillet to high heat. Sprinkle the red fish fillets with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat some grape seed oil on the skillet until it just begins to smoke. Lay the fillets on the skillet, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases from the skillet. Do not over crowd the pan, cook the fish in batches. In a saute pan melt the butter and toss the blanched asparagus and roasted carrots until hot. Season with salt and pepper.

When hard, use a sharp knife and a soup spoon to dig a trench down the center of the ice cream, reserving the ice cream from the trench to make a top later. The trench should leave an inch of vanilla ice cream along with long ends of the pan and go 3/4 of the way down the pan. Refreeze. Choose a large metal or glass bowl that will neatly sit on a pot on the stovetop. Put 1 to 2-inches water in the pot and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, beat the yolks and sugar together in the bowl (still on the countertop) with electric beaters until very thick and ribbony. Add the puree, and liqueur. Set the bowl over the pot of simmering water, and continue beating until very thick and much increased in volume, about 10 minutes. It should have the consistency of firmly whipped cream. Remove the bowl from the heat, and set it over a large bowl full of ice cubes. Continue beating until cool. Whip the cream to soft peaks and fold it in. Remove the bombe mould from the freezer and pour the raspberry mixture into the well of vanilla ice cream. Cover and return to the freezer for several hours, or until completely set. Soften the reserved \\trench\\ ice cream and spread it over the top to fill the pan to the brim. Freeze again. To serve, uncover the loaf mold.

The flat, plain disc is reminiscent of the confections that sit geometrically arranged in patisserie windows in Italy; the sharp, syrupy sogginess borrows from the classic English teatime favorite, the lemon drizzle cake. It is a good marriage: I love Italian cooking in all respects save one - I find their cakes both too dry and too sweet. Here, though, the flavorsome grittiness of the polenta and tender rubble of ground almond meal provide so much better a foil for the wholly desirable dampness than does the usual flour. But there is more to it than that. By some alchemical process, the lemon highlights the eggy butteriness of the cake, making it rich and sharp at the same time. If you were to try to imagine what lemon curd would taste like in cake form, this would be it. Although I am greedily happy to slice and cram messily straight into my mouth, letting damp clumps fall where they will, this cake is best eaten - in company at least - with spoon and fork. Either way, consider it a contender for teatime comfort and supper-party celebration alike. For the cake: Line the base of your cake pan with parchment paper and grease its sides lightly with butter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the butter and sugar till pale and whipped, either by hand in a bowl with a wooden spoon, or using a freestanding mixer. Mix together the almond meal, polenta and baking powder, and beat some of this into the butter-sugar mixture, followed by 1 egg, then alternate dry ingredients and eggs, beating all the while. Finally, beat in the lemon zest and pour, spoon or scrape the mixture into your prepared pan and bake in the oven for about 40 minutes. It may seem wibbly but, if the cake is cooked, a cake tester should come out cleanish and, most significantly, the edges of the cake will have begun to shrink away from the sides of the pan. Remove from the oven to a wire cooling rack, but leave in its pan. For the syrup: Make the syrup by boiling together the lemon juice and confectioners&#39; sugar in a smallish saucepan. Once the confectioners&#39; sugar has dissolved into the juice, you&#39;re done. Prick the top of the cake all over with a cake tester (a skewer would be too destructive), pour the warm syrup over the cake, and leave to cool before taking it out of its pan. Make Ahead Note: The cake can be baked up to 3 days ahead and stored in airtight container in a cool place. Will keep for total of 5 to 6 days. Freeze Note: The cake can be frozen on its lining paper as soon as cooled, wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and a layer of foil, for up to 1 month. Thaw for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 13628,&quot;Peanut Soup 3 tablespoons butter 2 stalks celery, grated 1 onion, grated 1 tablespoon flour 5 cups chicken stock 1 cup chunk-style peanut butter 3/4 cup milk 3/4 heavy cream Hot pepper sauce, to taste Salt and pepper, to taste 1/2 cup chopped roasted peanuts Instructions: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the grated celery and onion and cook them until they are translucent. Add the flour and stir until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Cook the paste for 2 to 3 minutes; then add the chicken stock, stirring until smooth. Raise the heat slightly, and bring the soup to a boil, and add the peanut butter, stirring to make sure that it is well mixed in. Lower the heat and allow the soup to simmer for 15 minutes. Finally add the milk, cream, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper, and bring the soup to the boil again. Correct the seasonings and serve hot, garnishing each serving with a few roasted peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 13629,&quot;Fudge, Nut and Fluff Apple Dessert Pizza 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 (1/4-ounce) packet fresh fast-acting yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water, between 100 and 115 degrees F, as measured with a candy thermometer (any hotter will kill the yeast - an organic leavener, too cool and the yeast won&#39;t be activated) 1 1/2 cups warm water, between 100 and 115 degrees F, as measured with a candy thermometer (any hotter will kill the yeast - an organic leavener, too cool and the yeast won&#39;t be activated)<br> 3 cups all purpose flour, plus some extra for the dough board 2 tablespoons cornmeal, for the pizza stone 2 tablespoons butter 3 to 4 apples, peeled, cored and sliced, and tossed with a little bit of lemon juice to prevent oxidation (good choices are Braeburn, Gala, Jonathan, Rome Beauty) 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup lemon juice 6 tablespoons caramel ice cream topping 6 tablespoons hazelnut and chocolate paste (recommended: Nutella) 1/2 cup mini-marshmallows 1/4 cup chocolate syrup Instructions: Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. (\\Proofing\\ the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop a foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn&#39;t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes.<br> Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to an hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.<br> While the dough is proofing, begin to prepare the topping. Melt the butter over medium heat in a pan with a lid. Add apples and stir gently to coat with the warm butter. Combine cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle over the apples. Stir in the lemon juice. Cover and cook over low to medium heat for about 40 minutes, or until the apples are cooked through and tender.<br> Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Stretch the dough out into a 14-inch circle which is thicker around the perimeter. Transfer dough to a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal. Top evenly with the cooked apple slices. Since the caramel topping and hazelnut, chocolate sauce are thick and awkward to spread, distribute spoonfuls of them evenly over the surface of the apple slices and the heat from the oven will make them melt onto the surface. Sprinkle with mini-marshmallows and drizzle with chocolate syrup. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the dough is nicely browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 13630,&quot;Garlicky Chicken Pita Wraps 3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely grated 1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat, sliced 1/8-inch thick across the grain Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 teaspoon curry powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 pieces pocket pita bread, each separated into 2 thin rounds 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup prepared hummus 2 whole dill pickles, each cut lengthwise into 6 spears 1 plum tomato, diced 1 1/2 cups shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce Hot sauce (optional) Instructions: Toss the chicken with the lemon juice, curry powder, pumpkin pie spice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 grated garlic clove, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Warm up the pita rounds on the skillet on one side only, about 10 to 15 seconds. Wrap the stacked pita rounds in aluminum foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet and increase the heat to medium-high. When the oil is just about to smoke, add the chicken and spread out in a shallow layer in the pan. Turn the heat up as high as it will go. Don&#39;t stir the chicken; allow it to develop some nice golden brown color on one side, about 4 minutes. Give the chicken a quick stir and cook for another 2 minutes to develop more color. Transfer to a bowl. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, if necessary. Mix together the mayonnaise, hummus and remaining grated garlic clove in a small bowl. Assemble the wraps: Have 6 sheets of aluminum foil or parchment paper ready. On a pita round, smear about 2 tablespoons of garlic mayonnaise hummus sauce along the middle, then top with a scant 1/2 cup chicken, a pickle spear, diced tomato, shredded lettuce, and hot sauce, if using. Roll the pita tightly around the filling. Wrap with foil to hold the roll together.

Split the breast plate and press down on the chicken in all joints to flatten it. Tuck the wings under so that the chicken lies flat. This will help it cook evenly. Repeat with the second chicken.<br> In a small bowl, combine the cl powders, paprika, fennel, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well, then rub the mixture all over the flattened chickens, making sure you get it into all the gaps in and around the joints. Marinate the chickens in the refrigerator for 1 hour uncovered. (Leaving the chicken uncovered helps the crust dry out and ensures you get a nice crispy skin when it cooks.)<br> Heat a grill to medium heat and rub down the grates with a lightly oiled paper towel to clean it and create a nonstick surface. Place the chickens skin side down on the grill. Watch for flare-ups when the chicken initially hits the grill, as the fat will render and drip down. If necessary, move the chicken to a new spot out of the flames. This will occur only in the initial drop. Place foil-wrapped bricks on top of the chickens to flatten them as they cook.<br> Cook for 15 minutes, then remove the bricks and flip the chicken. Cook for 18 to 20 minutes or until the internal temperature between the leg and thigh joint reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.<br> Transfer the chickens to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing each one into 10 pieces. Serve with apricot-mint chimichurri. Place the apricots and honey in a glass bowl; cover with hot water and soak for 10 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, in salted, boiling water, blanch the mint, parsley, and cilantro for about 30 seconds. Shock immediately in ice water and spread on a paper towel-lined sheet to dry.<br> Remove the apricots from the hot water and roughly chop. In a food processor or blender, combine all ingredients except the olive oil and process until all ingredients are finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly incorporate the olive oil and pulse until just combined (the consistency should be like a thick sauce).

Gradually whisk in the grits. Reduce the heat and simmer until the grits have thickened, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid lumps. Once the grits are thick and creamy, stir in the cheeses and adjust the consistency with stock and/or cream and season with salt and pepper. These grits provide a wonderful bed to soak up the flavor from the sausage, shrimp and veggies. For the sausage, shrimp and peppers: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the sausages and brown. Then transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon, leaving all of the fat in the skillet. Add the garlic, bell peppers and onions to the skillet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the shrimp and saute until they begin to turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the reserved sausage and the chicken stock to the skillet and let reduce a bit to intensify those flavors. Stir in the butter at the end and garnish with parsley.
