Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to keep at brisk simmer. Cook, stirring often, especially towards the end, until thickened and jammy, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool to warm or room temperature. For the crackers: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Whisk the egg white, rosemary, salt and pepper together in a large bowl until frothy. Add the almond flour and Parmesan. Mix well to form a dough. Flatten the dough into a rectangle and sandwich between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Roll the dough out into an approximate 10-inch square, patching up any cracks with your fingers as you go. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into approximate 1 1/2-inch squares. Transfer to the lined sheet pan and bake until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes, then transfer the crackers to the cooling rack and cool completely (crackers along the edge may cook faster than those in the center; transfer them to a cooling rack and continue to bake the remaining crackers). Serve the tomato chutney with the crackers on the side. Any remaining chutney can be kept refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week and is delicious with cheese, on burgers or on a sandwich. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 68080,&quot;Red Velvet Cookies with Cheesecake Filling One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 1/3 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, scooped and leveled (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, scooped and leveled 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon buttermilk 1 teaspoon red food coloring 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs Confectioners&#39; sugar, for coating Instructions: Make the filling: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat the cream cheese, granulated sugar, sour cream and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling at a time onto the parchment so that you have 12 dollops. Freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Make the cookies: Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Whisk together the granulated sugar, butter, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and eggs in another bowl. Fold the flour mixture into the sugar mixture with a rubber spatula until smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes (it will still be soft). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Coat your hands generously with confectioners&#39; sugar and scoop a heaping tablespoon of the cookie dough into your hand. Put one of the frozen cream cheese dollops in the middle of the dough and place another tablespoon of the dough on top of the cream cheese. Shape the dough around it to completely enclose the cream cheese, and then roll to coat in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Repeat with the remaining dough and cream cheese, coating your hands in confectioners&#39; sugar as needed. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake until the cookies are firm around the edges and can be easily lifted with a spatula, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the trays for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 68081,&quot;Oeufs Dans le Sirop d&#39;Erable (Eggs in Maple Syrup) 2 cups pure maple syrup 3 eggs 1/3 cup milk Pinch salt Instructions: In a heavy saucepan, bring maple syrup to a boil over medium heat just until syrup thickens.

Tear the bread into pieces and pulse in the food processor with the chopped walnuts until they become coarse breadcrumbs. Transfer the breadcrumb mixture to a wide, flat dish. Stir in the chopped chives and parsley. Flatten each piece of goat cheese into a disk and season with salt. Dip each disk in the beaten egg mixture and then coat with the breadcrumbs, packing the crumbs onto each disk. When all the goat cheese has been coated, chill them in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. To help facilitate the frying process, pop the disks in the freezer for 15 minutes before frying. Coat a large, nonstick saute pan generously with olive oil and bring to a medium-high heat.

Add the mayonnaise and puree. Add the pesto mixture to the cooled pasta and then add the Parmesan, peas, pignoli, salt, and pepper. Mix well, season to taste, and serve at room temperature. Place the walnuts, pignoli, and garlic in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process for 15 seconds. Add the basil leaves, salt, and pepper. With the processor running, slowly pour the olive oil into the bowl through the feed tube and process until the pesto is thoroughly pureed. Add the Parmesan and puree for a minute. Use right away or store the pesto in the refrigerator or freezer with a thin film of olive oil on top. Notes: Air is the enemy of pesto. For freezing, pack it in containers with a film of oil or plastic wrap directly on top with the air pressed out. To clean basil, remove the leaves, swirl them in a bowl of water, and then spin them very dry in a salad spinner. Store them in a closed plastic bag with a slightly damp paper towel. As long as the leaves are dry they will stay green for several days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 68105,&quot;Grilled Lamb Chops with Charmoula 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 2 racks lamb, frenched and cut into double rib portion Olive oil 2 small red onions, chopped 1 bunch parsley, stems removed 1 bunch cilantro, stems removed 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 cup olive oil 1 lemon, zested and juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Have the grill preheated to medium-high heat.

Cook until crisp. Add the carrots and onions to the pan and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, about 1 minute. Add the beans, barbecue sauce, 1 cup stock, honey and brown sugar and mix gently to combine; season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer, about 20 minutes. Check to see if the mixture is dry, and if it is, add a little more stock. Continue simmering until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in the burnt ends. Garnish the top with the parsley and let sit 10 minutes before serving. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and sweat the onion and garlic until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer 20 minutes. Puree the mixture in a food processor, pour into a bowl, and let cool at room temperature. May be refrigerated up to 1 week or frozen. Mix together all the spices in a bowl. Liberally rub the entire brisket with the spices, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove the brisket from the refrigerator 1 hour before beginning the smoking process to take the chill off, and remove the plastic wrap. Get your smoker running at 225 degrees F with hardwood charcoal and a few handfuls of soaked wood chips. This temperature should be maintained throughout the entire smoke. (If you are using a grill: Set up the grill for indirect heat, banking the coals on one side of the grill and scattering the wood chips on top. Maintain the temperature at 225 degrees throughout the smoking process, adding chips as necessary until you wrap the brisket in foil.) Place the brisket fat-side up on your smoker grate and close it up for the long smoke. Open your barbecue smoker every hour or 2 and spray the brisket liberally with apple juice to help keep the meat from drying out. Also keep apple juice in the water pan if you are using a water smoker. When the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170 degrees, after about 4 hours, wrap the brisket in aluminum foil and continue to cook for another 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours. This little trick is a big help in getting the meat tender, especially for beginners. Figure that a brisket smoked at around 200 degrees will take about 1 1/2 hours per pound. The brisket is done when the internal temperature reaches 185 degrees F. Remove and let rest 20 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil from the brisket over a large pan or disposable pan and reserve the liquid. Cut off the brisket points and reserve for another use. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 68116,&quot;Mushroom and Butternut Squash Risotto 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 cup dried porcini mushrooms<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/2 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 3 cups)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 pound mixed mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, chanterelle, etc.), thickly sliced<br> 2 medium shallots, chopped<br> 1 1/2 cups arborio rice<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for passing<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley<br> Instructions: Combine the chicken broth and 3 cups water in a medium saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Put the porcini mushrooms in a spouted measuring cup and ladle 1 cup hot stock over. Let soak 15 minutes. Remove the mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid, and finely chop. Pour the soaking liquid back into the broth. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the butternut squash and season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned and almost tender, about 10 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the skillet and turn to medium-high heat. Scatter in the fresh mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are well browned and have given up their liquid and the liquid has reduced away, 7 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat in the olive oil. Let the rice toast in the skillet for a minute, then stir in the reserved chopped porcini. Add the white wine. Bring to a simmer and cook until absorbed. Ladle in enough of the hot stock to just cover the rice. Adjust the heat so the risotto is gently simmering. Cook and stir the rice until the liquid is almost absorbed, then ladle in more stock just to cover. Continue to stir and add stock until the rice is al dente, adding the squash in the last 6 minutes of cooking time, 18 to 20 minutes. You may have a little bit of stock left over, and that&#39;s OK.) Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the butter, cheese and parsley.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Trim off any skin from the ham. Use a sharp paring knife to score through the fat in a diagonal crosshatch pattern without cutting through to the meat. Insert the cloves into the ham, placing them at the intersections of the cuts (you may have some cloves left over). Put the ham, flat-side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour 1/4 inch water into the bottom of the pan. Transfer to the oven and roast until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the ham registers 130 degrees F, about 2 hours and 30 minutes (about 15 minutes per pound). Meanwhile make the glaze: Squeeze the lime juice into a small saucepan. Add the ginger and pineapple juice. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup, 8 to 10 minutes.

Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Using your hands or a pastry blender, rub the butter into the dry ingredients by breaking it into tiny pieces, continuously pinching and squeezing it into the dry ingredients. Be careful to keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Beat the egg(s) in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter mixture. Stir in with a fork, continuing to stir until the dough begins to hold together, but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter flour on the work surface and scrape the dough onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth. To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all. Add the egg(s) to the work bowl and pulse ten times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter flour on the work surface and scrape the dough onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth. Press the dough into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough).

Wrap each piece of asparagus in a 4-by-1 3/4-inch sheet of nori and set aside. For the marinated mushroom: Trim all sides of the mushroom until you have a 4-by-1-by-1-inch rectangular block. Slice the block lengthwise into 4 thin slices. In a small mixing bowl, whisk the soy sauce and sugar together until the sugar dissolves.<br> Place a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the oil and mushrooms and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the soy mixture over the mushrooms and toss together until fully and evenly coated. Transfer the mushrooms to a small plate and let cool. Wipe out the skillet and reserve for cooking the tamago. Once the mushrooms have cooled, arrange the pieces onto half of a 4-inch square sheet of nori. Fold the remaining part of the nori over the mushrooms to wrap. For the cucumber: Trim the ends of the Persian cucumber until 4 inches long. Set aside. For the tamago (Japanese omelet): Beat together the eggs, soy sauce and pepper in a bowl. Place the reserved skillet from the mushrooms over medium-low heat. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the oil and one-third of the egg mixture. Gently scramble with a spatula until the eggs are barely set. Push the eggs to the side of the skillet, towards you. Add another 1/2 teaspoon oil to the empty portion of the skillet, add another third of the egg mixture and allow the eggs to cook into a flat disc. Once the eggs are barely set, flip the previously scrambled eggs over the flat disc of eggs and continue to flip until a roll forms. Push the roll to the side of the skillet again. Pour the remaining oil and egg mixture into the skillet and repeat the last step until you have a thicker, tight omelet roll. Slide the tamago onto a cutting board and cool. Once cool enough to handle, trim the omelet down to a 4-by-1/2-1/2-inch rectangle (scraps can be snacked on!). Set aside.<br> For the sushi rice: Combine the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small mixing bowl and whisk together. Sprinkle two-thirds of the vinegar mixture over the cooked white rice and gently fold together until fully incorporated.<br> Place one-quarter of the sushi rice into a mixing bowl and fold in the tobiko. Set aside. Sprinkle the remaining vinegar mixture over the cooked green pearl rice and gently fold together until fully incorporated. Set aside.<br> For the palm tree: Place one 4-by-7-inch sheet of nori onto a bamboo sushi rolling mat. Press a thin layer of plain rice over the center 3 inches of nori. Place the nori-wrapped mushrooms onto the center of the rice standing up and build a thin layer of rice next to and on top of the mushrooms to keep them balanced.<br> Gently flatten the rice on top of the mushroom and place 2 wrapped asparagus spears side by side, cut-side down, on top. Top the asparagus spears with a very thin layer of rice and top with the remaining 2 asparagus spears, cut-side down. Fill the remaining surface of nori that the tree is sitting on with rice. Add a 4-by-2-inch sheet of nori on one end to create a tail. Using the sushi mat, with the tail end away from you, carefully wrap the rice-topped nori over the palm tree and roll completely until sealed. Slice the roll into 6 pieces and transfer to a platter. For the geometric pattern: Place a 4-by-5 1/2-inch sheet of nori onto the sushi mat and top with a thin layer of tobiko rice. Lay the cucumber across the center of the tobiko rice. Then, using the sushi mat, wrap the rice and nori around the cucumber to seal. Slice the roll in half lengthwise. Turn each half cut-side down and slice in half lengthwise so the entire roll is quartered. Set aside. Place a 4-by-7-inch sheet of nori onto the sushi mat and top with 2 of the quarter rolls on the bottom edge of the sheet, side by side, so the top creates a V shape. Nestle the bottom half of the tamago into the V-shaped opening and set the remaining 2 quarter rolls against the top half. Using the sushi mat, carefully wrap the nori around the cut rolls until sealed.<br> Place a 4-by-7-inch sheet of nori onto the sushi mat and top with a thin layer of the green pearl rice.

On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the dough to an 8-inch round. Place the dough on a pizza peel that has been dusted with flour or semolina (you can also place on a cookie sheet). Lightly brush the surface of the dough with the chili oil. Place on the pizza stone and bake until the bottom begins to turn golden brown, but the pizza is not cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Place a nonstick 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot add the olive oil and butter and cook until the butter is melted. Add the egg mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the eggs are scrambled but still fairly wet, about 4 minutes. The eggs will cook further in the oven so it is important not to overcook them. Remove from the heat and remove from the pan to stop the cooking. Spread the eggs on the Pizza Dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Scatter the mozzarella cheese and Fontina cheese evenly over the eggs. Return to the oven and cook just until the cheese melts and is bubbly, about 5 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a firm surface. Arrange the smoked salmon slices over the surface of the pizza, covering the whole thing. Garnish with the chopped chives and salmon eggs. 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4 cup warm water. In a food processor, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and process until the mixture forms a ball. (The pizza dough can also be made in a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed until the mixture comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and starts to climb up the dough hook). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a cool spot for about 2 hours. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 1 hour. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. In a small saucepan, combine the garlic cloves and olive oil and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer until the garlic begins to turn brown, 10 to 15 minutes. (Do not let the garlic get too brown or the oil will have a bitter taste.) Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Add the red pepper flakes and infuse for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Refrigerate in a covered container for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Chianti]&quot; 68142,&quot;Chocolate Chip Cookie Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 1 cup almond flour 1 cup hazelnut flour 1/2 cup lightly packed light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1 large egg<br> 1/2 cup chocolate chips<br> 3 cups powdered sugar 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons heavy cream Instructions: For the cookie cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

(If the potatoes are ready before you are ready to serve them, you can wrap them in aluminum foil and they will stay hot for up to 1 hour.) Meanwhile, make the dip: Cook the scallions over direct heat, turning once, until charred on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. When cool enough to handle, finely slice and add to a bowl. Mix in the sour cream, parsley, Ranch Rub and celery seeds. Set aside until ready to serve. To serve: Split the sweet potatoes down the middle with a knife and spoon some of the ranch sour cream over, letting it melt down into the potato. Season with additional salt and pepper if desired. (Alternatively, you can bake the potatoes in a 400 degrees F oven for 1 hour.) Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl and mix well. Makes about 3/4 cup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 68148,&quot;Roasted Jerk Chicken with Garden Chimichurri 1 chicken leg (drumstick and thigh) 10 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 shallot, diced 2 tablespoons Jerk Spice Rub, recipe follows 6 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> 3 ounces cauliflower florets 5 cherry tomatoes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 teaspoon fresh rosemary<br> 1/3 teaspoon fresh tarragon<br> 3 ounces quinoa 2 tablespoons Garden Chimichurri, recipe follows 2 tablespoons ground coriander 2 tablespoons ground ginger<br> 2 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon cayenne powder<br> 1 tablespoon garlic powder<br> 1 tablespoon onion powder<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons coarse black pepper 2 teaspoons dry thyme<br> 1 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped 1 tablespoon fresh mint, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon minced shallot<br> 1/3 teaspoon minced garlic<br> A large pinch of red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Rub the chicken with the thyme, shallots and 2 tablespoons of the Jerk Spice Rub and refrigerate overnight in a baking dish.

Gradually whisk in the flour and salt until the mixture is smooth. Refrigerate for 1 hour until slightly thickened. Spray an 8-inch nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Place the pan over medium heat. With a small ladle, pour about 3 tablespoons of the batter into the pan. Turn the pan at a 45 degree angle to coat the pan evenly so the batter forms a perfect circle. Cook the crepe only until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Turn the crepe over with a spatula and cook the other side only until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Slide the crepe onto a 12-inch platter and continue the process with the remaining batter. Stack the crepes between waxed paper so they don&#39;t stick. You can prepare these crepes a day in advance covered in plastic wrap in the refrigerator. No need to reheat the crepes before filling and baking. Make the ricotta filling: In a large bowl, add all the ingredients for the ricotta filling. With a large wooden spoon or spatula, stir all the ingredients until well blended. Store covered in plastic wrap in the refrigerator until ready to use. You can make this filling the day before. Make the marinara sauce: In a large heavy nonreactive saucepan with a lid, heat the olive oil on medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic and cook until fragrant but NOT browned. Add the crushed tomatoes to the pan and crush further with a potato masher. Simmer 30 minutes, slightly covered, on medium-low heat, stirring every so often. Add the parsley, basil leaves and salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer for another 10 minutes until the sauce is slightly reduced. Taste and re-season as necessary. Put it all together: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with 1 cup of the prepared marinara sauce. Spoon 3 tablespoons of the prepared ricotta filling 1 inch from the edge of a crepe. Roll evenly into a log, keeping the filling even as you roll. Repeat with the remaining crepes. Place manicotti seam side down and side by side in the sauced baking pan. Spoon 1 to 2 cups of sauce over the top of the manicotti. Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake about 20 minutes. Uncover and bake another 20 minutes until the topping is golden brown and sides are bubbling. Let rest about 15 minutes before serving to firm up the manicotti filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 68151,&quot;Grilled Pork with Arugula-and-Grape Salad 1 shallot, finely chopped 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 boneless pork chops (about 5 ounces each) 3/4 cup red seedless grapes, halved 4 heaping cups baby arugula 1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola or other blue cheese Instructions: Combine the shallot, vinegar, 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in the olive oil, starting with a few drops and adding the rest in a steady stream. Put the pork chops in a shallow dish and season all over with salt. Add 3 tablespoons of the dressing and the remaining 1 teaspoon thyme. Rub all over the pork and let marinate 5 minutes. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the pork until just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Add the grapes and arugula to the remaining dressing and toss to coat. Transfer the pork chops to a serving platter or individual plates; top with the salad and sprinkle with the gorgonzola. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 68152,&quot;Cucumber Salad with Dill 1 English or 2 regular cucumbers, chopped 1/3 cup lowfat plain yogurt 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper Instructions: Combine all ingredients and toss to combine.

Combine the artichokes with the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and fill pot with enough water to cover the artichokes. Boil for 40 minutes or until tender. Remove artichokes from pot and let cool. Once artichokes have cooled, scoop out the centers with a spoon, to remove the choke. To prepare the sauce, combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, honey and mustard in a small bowl and mix well until smooth. Mix the shrimp with 3 tablespoons of the sauce and add the paprika and saffron. To serve, fill each artichoke with the remaining sauce. Garnish each artichoke by filling each leaf with a shrimp.

Place the halves on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment or baking mats. Preheat the oven to 415 degrees F, then start on the pizza toppings. For the toppings: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and saute the mushrooms and garlic for 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking until the mushrooms are cooked down and the liquid is mostly gone, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. To build the pizzas: brush a thin layer of olive oil in the center of each puff pastry half, leaving a 1/2-inch border. On each piece of pastry, sprinkle on 1/4 cup of the mozzarella, again so that it covers all but a 1/2-inch border around the pastry. Sprinkle the cooked mushrooms on one piece of pastry. On the second, sprinkle on the halved tomatoes and black olives. On the third, lay the pepperoni slices and sliced pepperoncini. Press the toppings lightly into the cheese. Leave the fourth piece of pastry plain (just cheese). Bake for 15 minutes; the pastry could go crazy and puff up in areas here and there, but don&#39;t worry! It&#39;ll be fine. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the goat cheese crumbles and half the basil over the mushroom pizza. Sprinkle the remaining basil over the tomato pizza. Top the pepperoni pizza with the fresh oregano.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the broccoli rabe until just tender, about 90 seconds, and immediately transfer to the ice bath until cooled. Drain water and squeeze out excess liquid, then place in the carafe of a food processor. Add the basil, pistachios, grated Parmesan and smashed garlic. Pulse with olive oil until still chunky but all ingredients have combined, using just enough olive oil to loosen. Add the mascarpone and pulse until just combined into the pesto. Remove the pesto from the carafe and set aside. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil to just barely coat the skillet. Sear the sausages on all sides until cooked through and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Whisk together the red wine vinegar, minced garlic and 1/4 cup olive oil in a small bowl. Season with salt and crushed red pepper. Toss the arugula, endive and escarole together in a bowl with the vinaigrette. Spoon all but a few spoonfuls of the pesto on the bottom of a plate or serving dish.

Butter a 9-by-5-inch glass loaf pan or an 8-inch square glass baking pan.<br> Arrange the brioche on a wire rack to dry out. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk until blended. Add the sugar and whisk until smooth. (Whisk really well or you&#39;ll get scrambled eggs when placed in the oven.) Add the milk, vanilla and salt and whisk until completely blended. Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into another bowl. Whisk in the citrus zest.<br> Place the brioche in the prepared pan, cutting to fit as needed. Pour the custard evenly over the bread, filling the dish to the top. You may not be able to add all of the custard at this point. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes, so that the bread can absorb the custard.<br> Just before baking, top off the dish with more of the remaining custard if the previous addition has been completely absorbed. Cover the dish with foil and bake until it has just set (no color is necessary), about 1 hour 15 minutes for a loaf pan and 35 to 45 minutes for an 8-inch square pan. To test for doneness, uncover the dish, slip a knife into the center and push the bread aside. If the custard is still very liquid, cover the dish and return the pudding to the oven for another 10 minutes. If only a little liquid remains, the pudding is ready to come out of the oven. The custard will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven and it will set up as it cools.<br> Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. You can serve the bread pudding by slicing it and removing each slice with an offset spatula, or by scooping it out with a serving spoon. Divide the bread pudding among plates. Add a scoop of ice cream. Top with Burnt Oranges and drizzle with Caramel Sauce. Top with a dollop of whipped cream.<br> Preheat the grill to medium. Dust the orange wedges with sugar. Grill until char marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, 1/2 cup water, the corn syrup and salt. (Use a good-size pan because the caramel will boil vigorously and the volume will increase dramatically as soon as the hot cream is added.) Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Let the mixture boil, without stirring, until amber colored. Watch the sugar mixture carefully as it cooks to avoid burning the sugar. From the time the mixture started to boil, it takes over 15 minutes to reach an amber color. Remove from the heat. The mixture will continue to cook off the heat and become darker, so make sure to have the cream close by.<br> Carefully and slowly add the warm cream to the caramel. The mixture will boil vigorously at first. Let the mixture simmer down and then whisk until smooth. Add the lemon juice and vanilla.<br> Cut the butter into 1-inch chunks and add to the caramel sauce, one piece at a time, whisking constantly after each addition. Whisk the caramel periodically as it continues to cool. Pour the caramel sauce into an airtight container such as a glass jar and store in the refrigerator. This will keep for up to a month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 68165,&quot;Steakhouse Grillers Prime Patty Melt 2 slices Swiss cheese (2 ounces total) 2 teaspoons butter or margarine 1 cup thinly sliced red onion 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms 2 Grillers Prime?

Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/4 cup cooking water. Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon to make a paste. Cook, stirring, until the paste puffs slightly, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking. Reduce the heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, until the sauce is creamy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons butter and the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the mushrooms and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Season with salt. Push to the side of the pan and repeat with the remaining mushrooms. Reduce the heat under the sauce to low and whisk in both cheeses until smooth. Stir in the mushrooms and pasta and toss, adding the reserved cooking water as needed. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and toast until golden; stir in the parsley. Divide the pasta among 8 small bowls.

Use a sharp knife to make a slit through the shell along the back of each shrimp. Remove the vein, leaving the shell intact. Rinse and pat dry, then transfer to a large bowl. Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, the ginger, paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper to taste in a bowl. Add half of the dressing to the bowl with the shrimp and toss. Add the lemon and zucchini to the remaining dressing and toss, then spread on a large foil-lined baking sheet. Broil until the lemon and zucchini begin to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the shrimp and broil until the shells are pink, about 3 minutes. Turn the shrimp, lemon and zucchini and broil 3 to 4 more minutes. Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, the parsley and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Divide the shrimp, lemon and zucchini among plates and drizzle with the parsley oil. Serve with bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68170,&quot;Braised Short Ribs 6 bone-in short ribs (about 5 3/4 pounds) Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 1 large Spanish onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 ribs celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 carrots, peeled, cut in 1/2 lengthwise, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1 1/2 cups tomato paste 2 to 3 cups hearty red wine 2 cups water 1 bunch fresh thyme, tied with kitchen string 2 bay leaves Instructions: Season each short rib generously with salt. Coat a pot large enough to accommodate all the meat and vegetables with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Add the short ribs to the pan and brown very well, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Do not overcrowd pan. Cook in batches, if necessary. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. While the short ribs are browning, puree all the vegetables and garlic in the food processor until it forms a coarse paste. When the short ribs are very brown on all sides, remove them from the pan. Drain the fat, coat the bottom of same pan with fresh oil and add the pureed vegetables. Season the vegetables generously with salt and brown until they are very dark and a crud has formed on the bottom of the pan, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Scrape the crud and let it reform. Scrape the crud again and add the tomato paste. Brown the tomato paste for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan. Lower the heat if things start to burn. Reduce the mixture by half. Return the short ribs to the pan and add 2 cups water or until the water has just about covered the meat. Add the thyme bundle and bay leaves. Cover the pan and place in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Check periodically during the cooking process and add more water, if needed. Turn the ribs over halfway through the cooking time. Remove the lid during the last 20 minutes of cooking to let things get nice and brown and to let the sauce reduce. When done the meat should be very tender but not falling apart. Serve with the braising liquid. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Barolo]&quot; 68171,&quot;Cole Slaw with Pecans and Spicy Dressing 1 head napa or savoy cabbage, shredded 4 carrots, shredded 2 Granny Smith apples, thinly sliced 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced 1 cup pecans, toasted and chopped Leaves from 1 bunch fresh mint, for garnish 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon ground chipotle 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1 lemon, juiced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine the cabbage, carrots, apples, onion, and pecans in a large bowl.

Add the prosciutto, and cook until crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside. Combine the hazelnuts, pecorino and parsley in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. In a bowl, toss together the escarole, hazelnut mixture and some pickled red onions. Dress with some red onion pickling liquid and olive oil. Season with salt, and garnish with crispy prosciutto. For the chicken Milanese: Set up a standard breading station in three wide, deep plates. Fill one plate with the flour, a second with the beaten eggs, and a third with the panko and Parmesan. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt. Using one hand for dry things and one hand for wet things, take each piece of chicken through the breading procedure: Dredge lightly in the flour, then in the egg wash, and then through the breadcrumbs. Lay the breaded chicken on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Pour olive oil into a large saute pan until it reaches a depth of about 1/2 inch--better a little more than a little less. Bring the oil to medium-high heat. Test by flicking flour or breadcrumbs into it; if it doesn&#39;t sizzle, WAIT! When the oil is hot, test it again by dipping the edge of a piece of chicken; the oil should sizzle gently. In batches, cook the chicken on both sides until crispy and a lovely golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. (Do not crowd the pan or the chicken will become very greasy and soggy.) When the chicken comes out of the oil, drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. If you like, keep the chicken warm in a low oven while the rest of the chicken is cooking. Place the chicken serving plates and top with escarole salad. In a small bowl, combine the red wine vinegar with 1/2 cup cold tap water. Stir in the salt, sugar and hot sauce. Add the sliced onions, and let sit for at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 68173,&quot;Deluxe Chef Salad 2 oz Boar&#39;s Head Ovengold Turkey Breast 1/2 oz Boar&#39;s Head Lacey Swiss Cheese 1/2 oz Boar&#39;s Head Yellow American Cheese 1 oz Avocado, Sliced 1 oz Celery, Julienne 1 oz Cucumber, Halved Lengthwise 1 oz Green Bell Peppers, Julienne 1-1/2 oz Romaine Lettuce 1-1/2 oz Spring Mix Lettuce 1-1/2 oz Tomato, Diced 1 Hard Boiled Egg 2 oz Boar&#39;s Head Deluxe Ham 1 oz Carrots, Julienne Instructions: Slice cucumber and toss with lettuce, celery and carrots.

Spoon a heaping line of half the filling down the center of the dough. Pull the long edges up over the filling and pinch them together. Arrange the strands side by side, with the seams down. Beginning in the middle, cross 1 strand over the other, being careful to keep the seams facing down, and continue to cross the strands until you reach their ends. Pinch the ends together. Bring the ends around to form a ring and pinch the ends together.<br> Carefully pick up the ring, place it seam side down on the prepared pan or sheet, and cover it well with plastic wrap. Let the ring rise until very soft and tripled in size, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, 30 minutes before baking, arrange an oven rack in the lower position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Beat the egg with a pinch of salt for glazing the ring.<br> When the ring has tripled in size and the dough does not push back when gently pressed with your finger but remains indented, brush it with the egg glaze. Sprinkle it with poppy seeds or sesame seeds, if desired. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until very well browned. After 30 minutes of baking, turn the pan around so that the ring browns evenly. When the ring is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool on a rack.<br> Combine all ingredients in a bowl.

Butter 48 mini-muffin tins. (There is enough batter to make 48 cakes in tins with a 2-tablespoon capacity or 16 cakes in standard muffin tins holding 1/3 cup.)<br> Working in a medium mixing bowl with a whisk, beat the egg whites just to break them up. Add the ground almonds, sugar, flour and corn syrup and stir until the batter is smooth. (If you&#39;d like, you can cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for as long as overnight.) Put the butter in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Remove the butter from the heat and stir it into the batter. When the batter is no longer warm, stir in the chocolate chips.<br> Spoon about 1 tablespoon of batter into each muffin tin. (If you are using regular-size tins, use about 3 tablespoons of batter for each muffin mold.) Bake the cakes for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden; a knife inserted in the center of the cakes should come out clean. Allow the cakes to cool for 2 or 3 minutes, then turn them out onto racks to cool to room temperature. When the cakes are cool, you can top them with ganache, if you wish. Put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Pour the cream over the chocolate, let rest 30 seconds, then gently stir the cream into the chocolate with a small whisk. (Stir, do not beat -- you don&#39;t want to beat air into the ganache.) The ganache is now ready to be used as a dip.<br> To dip: Place the tiger cakes upside down on a cooling rack. (To protect your counter, put a sheet of parchment or foil under the rack.) One by one, dip the bottoms of the cakes into the ganache, glazing them with ganache to about the half-way point. Return the cakes to the rack to set \\u2013 about 1 hour at room temperature or 15 minutes in the refrigerator. Keeping: Tigres will keep in a covered container at room temperature for up to 3 days, although ganache-topped tigres are best eaten the day they are made.

Pulse to combine. Pulse, pulse, pulse until the ingredients start to come together and resembles Parmesan. Add the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water. Pulse a couple of more times until the ingredients start to form a ball. If the mixture is exceedingly wet, add some more flour. Or conversely, if the mix is dry, dry, dry, add in a few more drops of water. When the mixture has come together into a ball, turn it out onto a floured work surface and knead it a couple of times to help it come together. Dust it with flour, form it into a disk and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use. This can be done a day ahead. Cook&#39;s Note: When ready to use the dough, remove it from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before rolling, to allow it to warm up and soften. To make the filling: Coat the bottom of a stock pot lightly with olive oil put over medium heat. Add the onions, celery and the carrots and sprinkle with salt, to taste. Saute the vegetables for 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat for another 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt, then add the chicken and the chicken stock. If the stock doesn&#39;t cover the chicken, add water until it does. Bring the stock to a boil, over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. While the chicken is simmering, add the butternut squash to a large bowl, drizzle with some olive oil and add salt, to taste. Toss to coat the squash with the oil and transfer to a baking sheet. Roast until the squash is cooked but still has some texture, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and reserve. Remove the chicken and vegetables from the stock and put into a large bowl. Reserve the stock. When the cool enough to handle, remove the bones from the chicken and stir into the vegetables. Add the roasted squash to the chicken and vegetables. Stir to combine and season with salt, if needed. Stir in the haricots verts and the chopped sage. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the flour and stir to combine with melted butter. Cook stirring frequently until the mixture is the consistency of wet sand and is starting to turn a little beige, about 6 to 7 minutes. Gradually whisk in the reserved chicken stock. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed. When the stock is combined into the roux, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until it has a gravy-like consistency, about 20 to 25 minutes. If the gravy reduces too much and becomes too thick, whisk in a little more chicken stock or water. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the chicken mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish or 4 individual (2 cup) crocks. Ladle the \\gravy\\ over the chicken mixture until the dish(s) are 3/4 filled. Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll the dough into the shape of the casserole dish or large enough to cut circles to cover the individual casserole dishes. Whichever dishes are being used the dough needs to have generous overhang of dough on the edges of the dish. Brush the outside edges of the dish with a little of the egg wash to help \\glue\\ the dough to sides of the dish. Fold the edges of the dough under and press it onto the edges of the dish. Brush the top of the dough with the remaining egg wash. Cut a couple of vents in the top of the dough to allow the steam to escape. Bake in the preheated oven until the dough is golden brown and the inside is hot and bubbly, about 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve hot.

Add the olive oil and saute the garlic, rosemary and sage for a couple of minutes. Add the pork loin to the pan, gently sliding it on top of the herbs to prevent the hot oil from jumping onto your skin.<br> Saute the pork for about 5 minutes on each side, then remove it from the pan and set aside on a plate. Add the wine to the pan and use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan; cook until the smell of the alcohol has disappeared, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Lower the flame to a very low-medium heat. Return the pork to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Partially cover with a lid and cook for about 1 1/2 hours, flipping the pork and scraping the bottom of the pan every 15 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on the sauce, making sure it does not reduce too much; add some warm water if necessary, always in very small increments.<br> When the pork is ready, remove the pan from the heat and let cool for about 30 minutes. Remove the pork to a cutting board.<br> When the sauce is cooled, add the milk and put the pan back on the stove. Heat gently over medium-low heat, stirring the sauce constantly. This will prevent any curd from forming and will produce a wonderful and soft creamy sauce. Slice the pork and serve with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]</p><p>&quot; 68238,&quot;Crispy Onions 1 cup all purpose flour 2 tablespoons hot Hungarian paprika 4 vidalia onions, sliced paper thin on an electric slicer or vegetable slicer Salt to taste Deep fat fryer and oil Instructions: Preheat the deep fat fryer, a stovetop fryer or high sided pot with the recommended amount of oil to 360 degrees. Combine the flour and paprika evenly in a flour sifter and sift into a large bowl. Add the thinly sliced onions to the flour and toss and shake well to coat the onions evenly in seasoned flour. Put the onions into a strainer and shake off any excess flour so that what remains is the thinnest coat possible. Cooking in small batches, put the coated onions in a fryer basket and carefully submerge in the hot oil. Shake the basket to insure even frying and remove from the fryer when the onions have cooked to a deep golden, but not dark brown, color. Continue in this manner until all the onions have been cooked. Season each batch with salt as it&#39;s removed from the fryer.

Once the oil is shimmering, add the onions and season with pinch of salt. Cook until the onions are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, chipotle peppers and tomato paste and saute? until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the turkey, breaking the meat down using a spatula. Add the dried seasonings--the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin and ancho chili powder--and 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons each salt and pepper and mix as you break the meat down more using the spatula. Allow this to cook until all of the meat is browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer the cooked turkey to a medium bowl and set aside. Using the same skillet (don\\u2019t worry about cleaning the skillet out; it\\u2019s okay for those flavors to also mesh with the chorizo), add the beef chorizo and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside. In a large pot, add the chili base, cl sauce and tomato sauce over medium to medium-low heat. Let the brick break down completely, then add the meat mixture and cooked chorizo to the pot.

In a bowl, combine flour, butter, brown sugar, pecans, and smoked paprika. Using a pastry cutter, work the ingredients until a rough dough forms; it should resemble large grains. Place streusel on a nonstick baking sheet in an even layer. Sprinkle cheese on top. Bake until toasty, 15 to 20 minutes. For the apples: In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, add sugar and water. Bring to a low boil, occasionally swirling the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes until the sugar begins to caramelize and turn light brown to amber; this is a little tricky and needs to be watched continuously. When light brown, turn off the heat, add the apples and whisky, and light on fire to flambe (this will cook out some of the alcohol). Then, add the butter and turn heat to low. Cook the apples, flipping to coat in the caramel, about 2 to 4 minutes. In the meantime, combine the whipped cream and creme fraiche.

Add the chicken breasts and then lower to a simmer. Simmer until the chicken is just cooked through and the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes; remove to a bowl. Once cooled, shred the chicken and reserve. Add the orzo or rice to the pot with the chicken stock and cook until al dente, 5 to 8 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and most of the lemon juice, reserving some to add later as needed. Fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. Once combined, ladle in some hot stock to temper the egg mixture, whisking constantly and adding the hot liquid slowly. Very slowly, add the warm whipped egg/lemon mixture into the pot, whisking constantly to prevent any curds or clumps from forming. Continue to cook over medium-low to medium heat, whisking, until the soup thickens, about 10 minutes more. Add the shredded chicken and any reserved juices to the soup. Add the lemon zest and season with salt and plenty of freshly cracked black pepper. Taste and add additional lemon juice if needed.

Stuff each bird with 3 sprigs thyme, 2 cloves garlic, the bay leaf, onion and lemon. As the chickens cook, this will help keep them moist and also flavor the bird from the inside.<br> Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together of each bird, and then tuck the wing tips underneath each body so it cooks evenly. Place the birds on a roasting rack over a roasting tray then sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Place in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the joint between the leg and thigh registers 165 degrees F, approximately 1 hour more. When the chicken is done, the skin will be crispy and golden and the juices of the chicken will run clear.

Line the mini tins with paper liners. In a large bowl combine the mascarpone cheese, egg whites and vegetable oil. Using a hand mixer, beat the ingredients until combined and creamy. Add the cake mix and water and mix until smooth, about 3 minutes. Fill the mini cups to just below the rim and bake until puffed and golden, about 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly in the tin then transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack. Meanwhile, puree the strawberries in a blender or small food processor. Place the powdered sugar in a medium bowl. Pour in the strawberry puree and whisk until smooth. Top the cooled cupcakes with the strawberry glaze. Let the cupcakes sit for a few minutes for the glaze to firm up, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68263,&quot;Brandy Snaps 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 5 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 cup golden syrup, such as Lyle\\u2019s 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream 6 tablespoons confectioners\\u2019 sugar 1 tablespoon brandy, optional 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: For the brandy snaps: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. You\\u2019ll need 2 wooden spoons with 3/4-inch-thick handles to roll the brandy snaps around. If the handles are too thin, tightly wrap foil around them until they are the right thickness. Combine the butter, granulated sugar, golden syrup and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over medium low, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted and the sugar is mostly dissolved (it should never come to a simmer), about 10 minutes. Let cool slightly for 2 minutes, then sift the flour and ginger directly into the saucepan through a fine-mesh sieve. Stir until combined and a smooth, fluid paste. Place 5 to 6 separate heaping teaspoons at least 4 inches apart from each other on the prepared baking sheets. Gently spread each mound into an even 2-inch circle with the back of a spoon. Bake one sheet at a time for 6 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet and continue baking until caramel to toffee brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. (If too pale, the brandy snaps will not get crisp enough.) Let the brandy snaps cool briefly for about 2 minutes on the baking sheet until you can slide a small offset spatula underneath one and lift it off (it should still be warm and flexible). Place on a cutting board rough-side down and roll around the wooden spoon handle, pressing down on the seam to seal. Working quickly, repeat with the remaining brandy snaps, alternating with the 2 wooden spoons and removing the rolled brandy snaps to a rack to cool completely. (If too stiff to roll, return the brandy snaps to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes until flexible again.) Bake and roll the brandy snaps on the second baking sheet, then continue the process of spooning, baking and rolling with the remaining batter, alternating the baking sheets. For the filling: When ready to serve, whip the heavy cream, confectioners\\u2019 sugar, brandy if using, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a piping bag or large resealable plastic bag. Cut the tip and pipe the whipped cream into the rolled brandy snaps. Serve within 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68264,&quot;Mango-Pineapple Juice 1 firm mango, peel and pit removed (about 2 cups chopped) 2 cups pineapple chunks 2 large, juicy limes, peel and pith removed 1 tablespoon chia seeds, optional Instructions: Juice, in this order, the mango, pineapple and limes, following your juicer&#39;s specific settings for each.

Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring frequently and adjusting the heat to maintain a steady stream of bubbles. Cook until the shallots are rust colored, about 15 minutes. Carefully pour through a strainer into a second pot, then transfer the shallots to a paper-towel-lined plate. (Save the oil for stir-fries or for second batch of shallots.) Separate the shallots with a fork and season with salt. Allow to cool completely before storing in a sealed container (will keep for several weeks at room temperature).<br> Sprinkle the beef with 3 tablespoons salt. Set on a rack in a baking dish, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate overnight.<br> The next day, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F and adjust the rack to the lower-middle positions. Roast the beef until it is lightly browned, 35 to 45 minutes. Flip the roast, reduce the heat to 300 degrees F and continue roasting until the center registers 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 minutes to 1 hour longer. Remove from the oven and allow to rest at least 45 minutes. Slice as thinly as possible.<br> Combine the thousand island and horseradish in a small bowl. Split the rolls in half and toast.

Use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Place the vanilla bean seeds, butter, sugar, egg yolks, and ginger in a medium-size mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the ingredients are combined, about 1 minute. Combine the baking powder, salt, cocoa powder and flour and add to the butter mixture all at once. Beat on low speed just until combined, about 1 minute. Do not overmix the dough or it will become tough. Remove the dough from the bowl. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. I baked my cookies in a special flexible baking sheet with dome-shaped cavities. Roll the dough into a rope that is about the same diameter as the cookie mold. Use a knife to cut each piece of dough. Press the dough into the mold. Repeat until all of the cavities are filled. Bake 15 to 20 minutes. To make the chocolate fans: Use an offset spatula to spread a very thin layer of tempered chocolate onto a piece of marble. Use a spatula to clean away chocolate so you are left with a rectangle shape. Let the chocolate set slightly. Place 1 hand on the handle of the cake triangle and rest your thumb on the blade of the triangle. Push the triangle through the chocolate in strips of about 2 inches. Use your thumb to catch 1 side of the chocolate to create small chocolate fans. Pinch the short side to create the handle of the fan. I colored my fans with my airbrush but you could also use a paintbrush. If using an airbrush, place a few drops of color in the airbrush. If using a paintbrush, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Apply color where you are inspired to do so. When the cookies have cooled, use a sharp knife to cut a wedge from the top of each cookie. Position the chocolate fans on top of each cookie.

Butter the inside of a 2 1/2quart souffle dish. In a large saucepan, melt the butter, add the flour and whisk to form a smooth roux. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove the mixture from the heat, add the chevre and stir until the cheese is melted and wellincorporated. Stir in the egg yolks and season generously with salt and pepper (the seasoning should be intense here to compensate for the later addition of the egg whites). With an electric mixer or by hand with a whisk, whip the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it, then carefully fold in the remaining egg whites. Fill the prepared souffle mold; it should be about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the top of the souffle with the dried thyme. Bake in the preheated oven until risen, golden brown and just barely firm in the center, 40 to 45 minutes.

Spread the shredded coconut on a baking sheet and toast until light golden brown, stirring a few times, about 7 minutes. Cool slightly, then transfer to a blender or food processor and process until coarsely chopped. Spread the almonds on the baking sheet and toast until fragrant, stirring once, about 5 minutes. Immediately transfer to a medium bowl, add the honey, and toss to coat. Add the coconut and stir to coat the almonds. Line the baking sheet with parchment and spray with nonstick spray. Spread the coated almonds on the parchment and set aside for about 2 hours, until set?the almonds will remain slightly sticky. Coarsely chop the almonds before serving. For the oatmeal: In a medium saucepan, whisk 3 cups water with the milk, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the oats, return to a boil and then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oats are soft and the mixture has thickened, about 30 minutes; the oats should be very cream. Add more water if the mixture becomes too dry and the oats need more cooking time. Divide the oatmeal among four serving bowls and top with banana, mango, crystallized ginger and chopped almonds. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 68322,&quot;Pork Belly Po&#39; Boy 3 pounds pork belly, sliced into 1-inch cubes 1/2 cup salt, plus more for seasoning Peanut oil, for frying Black pepper 1 cup mayonnaise 6 tablespoons maple syrup Six 6-inch French baguettes, halved horizontally and toasted Louisiana-style hot sauce, for spreading 2 cups chopped lettuce 1 cup sliced dill pickles Instructions: Fully submerge the pork belly in a pot of water, add the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the pork belly is flaky and tender, 3 to 4 hours. Turn off the heat and drain. Heat peanut oil in a fryer or large pot to 350 degrees F. Gently place handfuls of the rendered pork belly into the fryer until golden crispiness, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68323,&quot;Alligator Eclairs 1 cup water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 to 4 eggs, plus 1 2 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 6 egg yolks 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 4 ounces semisweet chocolate 1/2 cup milk 1 tube green frosting Instructions: To make the eclairs: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt, and granulated sugar to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once, and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 30 seconds to evaporate some of the moisture. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, and working 1 egg at a time, add 3 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add the remaining egg and mix until incorporated. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip, pipe the dough onto the baking sheet, in 3-inch long segments. Whisk the remaining egg with 1 1/2 teaspoons water. Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash (you may not use all the egg wash). Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F, and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 25 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. Meanwhile, make the fillings: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Pour into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. (The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Refrigerate until 1 hour before using.) To make the chocolate piping ganache, heat the cream to boil it and pour in over the chopped chocolate, whisking to blend. Let sit until thick enough to pipe. Place in a pastry bag with a small plain tip. Using a long serrated knife, cut the eclairs partly open starting at one end and cutting halfway through to the middle of the eclair. Using a clean pastry bag, pipe the custard filling onto the eclair starting to fill in the uncut end then moving down to the cut end. With the piping ganache, pipe a top and bottom row of teeth along the cut edge. Pipe a strip of green frosting on the top to make his back. With the chocolate ganache, pipe 2 eyes on the top of the eclair, 2 nostrils, and some wiggle-y, scaly looking lines like eyebrows over the eyes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68324,&quot;Phyllo Berry Sabayon Tart 4 to 6 sheets of phyllo 3 to 4 tablespoons melted butter 1/4 cup sugar 6 egg yolks 1 cup Muscat wine or any other sweet wine 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups heavy cream Assorted berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, etc.) Powdered sugar for dusting Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. To make the tarts you can use muffin tins to form the individual tarts or you can use small tart rings. To begin you should have your sugar and melted butter with a pastry brush ready. If not using immediately keep the phyllo dough covered with a damp towel as it has a tendency to dry out very quickly. Brush each sheet with enough butter to lightly coat. Sprinkle with sugar and fold the dough in half and then cut the rectangle in half creating 2 squares. Place each square in muffin tins and the dough may bunch up on top that is okay it will appear ruffled when baked. Repeat this method as many times as you need for each serving. Bake phyllo for 10 minutes or until golden brown and set. Whisk together the egg yolks, sweet wine, and sugar in a large bowl. (Remember this is going to need room to grow 3 times its volume). Place this bowl on top of a pot of simmering water and begin to whip constantly. It will probably take 10 minutes or so, so you may want to have a relief whisker available. Once the sabayon is light and airy yet you can see the tracks made by the whip take off the double boiler and place bowl inside of a larger bowl that has water and ice in it to cool the cream down. Once cooled you can whip 2 cups of heavy cream until medium to stiff peaks. Fold into the sabayon. To assemble the tarts, place the baked phyllo cups on plates and spoon in sabayon cream, then pile high with any berries you like. Dust with powdered sugar and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Cava]</p><p>&quot; 68325,&quot;Ramen with Charred Pork 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth 6 thick slices fresh ginger, plus 2 teaspoons minced<br> 4 cloves garlic (3 smashed, 1 minced) 2 scallions, cut into thirds, plus sliced scallions for topping 3/4 cup dried shiitake mushrooms 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 4 boneless pork chops (1/2 inch thick; about 4 ounces each)<br> 2 large eggs 1 1/2 pounds fresh ramen noodles 1 5-ounce package baby spinach Shichimi togarashi (Japanese spice mix), for topping Instructions: Combine the chicken broth, 2 1/2 cups water, the sliced ginger, 3 smashed garlic cloves, 2 cut-up scallions, the shiitake mushrooms, soy sauce and rice wine in a large pot.

Cook until the shells open slightly (wide enough to slide a knife in), 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the size of the oysters.<br> Carefully remove the roasting pan from the grill. Insert the tip of an oyster knife or small sharp paring knife in the shell opening and run the knife along the inside of the top shell to release the oyster; remove the top shell. Run the knife under the oyster meat in the bottom shell to release the oyster, keeping the oyster and juices in the shell. Repeat with the remaining oysters, placing 12 of them on a platter and the remainder back in the pan. Serve the oysters on the platter immediately with the mignonette, or refrigerate until ready to serve. (See Cook&#39;s Note.)<br> Spoon the bourbon BBQ sauce over 12 of the remaining oysters in the roasting pan (about 1 teaspoon each). Top each with some of the bacon and chives.<br> Put a dollop of the scampi butter over the 12 remaining oysters in the roasting pan (about 1 teaspoon each).<br> Return the roasting pan to the grill, close the lid and cook until the oyster fillings are just starting to bubble, about 5 minutes. Remove from the grill and transfer to a serving platter.<br> Sprinkle the scampi butter oysters with the remaining 1 tablespoon chopped parsley and serve immediately.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 68342,&quot;Black and White Cookies 1/3 cup cream 7 ounces dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces 3/4 cup sugar 1 (18-ounce) package sugar cookie dough Instructions: Place a small pan over medium heat. Add the cream and warm until almost boiling, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the chocolate. Stir for 1 to 2 minutes until the chocolate melts. Place the chocolate mixture into a small bowl. Cool the chocolate until firm enough to roll into balls. (To cool quickly, place the chocolate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.) Once the chocolate is firm, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the sugar in an empty pie dish. Roll the chocolate into teaspoon-sized balls and set aside. Roll a walnut-sized ball of cookie dough into a thin log about 3 inches long. Place a chocolate ball on a work surface and wrap a cookie dough log around the chocolate ball and press to adhere. It should look like a cookie version of the planet Saturn. Roll the cookie in the sugar to coat. Place the cookie on a large baking sheet and continue forming the remaining cookies and rolling them in sugar. Once all the cookie balls are on the baking sheets, use the bottom of a drinking glass to flatten the cookies to about 1/4 inch thick. Bake the cookies for 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 68343,&quot;Amalfi Lemon Chicken 4 teaspoons lemon zest, from 3 large lemons 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves<br> 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup olive oil, divided<br> 3 lemons, sliced 1/3 inch thick (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 (3 1/2 pound) chicken, back bone and breast bone removed<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Combine the cumin, garlic powder, ginger, mustard, onion powder, pepper, chili powder and 1 tablespoon of the salt in a small mixing bowl. Sprinkle the pork all over with half of the spice rub; set the other half aside. Add the oil to the multi-cooker and sear the pork on all sides. You may need to sear in batches. Pour in the stock, vinegar and half of the jam. Add the mustard and garlic. Close and lock the multi-cooker and set the valve to the sealing position. Turn on, select the high-pressure function and set the timer for 45 minutes. Once the cook time ends, move the valve to the venting position (using a towel to protect your hand) to quickly release the steam. Turn off the cooker and transfer the pork to a cutting board. Strain the pot liquor into a fat separator. While the pork is cooling, assemble the BBQ sauce in the bowl of the multi-cooker: Pour in 1/4 cup of the strained pot liquor and the remaining jam, spice rub and 1 teaspoon salt. Whisk in the tomato sauce, molasses, soy sauce and Worcestershire until evenly combined. Turn on the sear/saute function and cook until the sauce begins to simmer, 2 to 3 minutes. Once the sauce has thickened slightly, turn off the multi-cooker. Pull the tender pork into large chunks using two forks. Add the pulled pork to the hot sauce and toss to combine. Top with parsley.

Slice the garlic horizontally, drizzle with olive oil and wrap in tin foil. Place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove, cool and mash the cloves into a paste. While the garlic is cooking, get a small saute pan hot over medium-low heat and toast the cumin seeds for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Then either grind up the toasted cumin in a spice grinder or chop with a knife until fine. Mix the sour cream with the toasted cumin, parsley and the roasted garlic. Reserve. For the latkes: Fill a pot three-quarters of the way up with water and add the potatoes. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn down the heat to a low boil. Boil until the potatoes are completely cooked (a knife slides in very easily), 20 to 30 minutes. While the potatoes are boiling, heat up a pan over medium heat with 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Saute the leeks with the garlic until soft with no color. Season well with salt and pepper, lower the heat to medium-low and cook for another 3 minutes. Then take off the heat. Once the potatoes are ready, place in a large bowl and mix in the sauteed leek mixture, nutmeg, the remaining 5 tablespoons butter and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper, and reserve. Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl or dish and set aside. Add the breadcrumbs and the flour to two separate plates. Season the flour well with salt and pepper. Roll a ball with the potato mixture that easily fits in the palms of your hands, about 2 tablespoons, and flatten slightly to make a patty. You don&#39;t want them too thick or too big. Dredge the potato patty with the flour, shaking off the excess. Dunk in the eggs and then coat with the breadcrumbs. Get a large pan hot over medium-high heat, add an inch of canola oil and fry when the temperature reaches 350 degrees F. Remove from oil when the latkes are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

Place the brisket in a heavy roasting pan. In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, garlic, and oregano. Rub the mixture on the brisket. Pile the carrots, celery, onions, and bay leaves on the brisket and pour in enough tomato juice to come about 3/4 of the way up the meat and vegetables. Cover the top of the pan with 2 sheets of parchment paper, then with aluminum foil. (The tomato juice will react unpleasantly with the aluminum foil if they touch.) Bake for 3 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender. Remove the meat from the pan and keep it warm. Place the pan on 2 burners and boil the vegetables and sauce over medium heat for another 30 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened. To serve, slice the meat across the grain.

Brush the green onions with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until charred and just wilted, turning once. Combine the vinegar, 3/4 cup water, the sugar, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, the coriander seeds, garlic and jalapeno in a medium nonreactive saucepan, bring to a boil and cook until the sugar has melted. Remove from the heat, transfer to a nonreactive bowl, add the green onions, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. For the duck sliders: Prepare the Caja China according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Make some balls out of aluminum foil to prop up the Caja China rack that sits over the drip pan--the rack should be slightly elevated in the drip pan so that the ducks stay above the fat that will render into the pan during the cooking process. Put the rack on the foil in the pan. Brush the ducks on both sides with canola oil and sprinkle with the ancho powder and some salt and pepper. Put the ducks in breast side-down on the rack, put the cover on and put the hot coals on top. Add about a chimney full of cold coals to the hot--they will catch and cook as the hot coals burn. Add more cold coals as needed to keep the fire hot throughout the cooking process. Cook the ducks for 45 minutes. Remove the coals and lid, brush the backs of the ducks with some of the barbecue sauce, flip over, brush the tops with more of the sauce and continue cooking until golden brown and cooked through and the skin is crispy, about 45 minutes more. While the ducks cook, combine the remaining barbecue sauce, the apple juice concentrate, sugar, fennel, cinnamon, star anise and habanero in a medium saucepan and cook until heated through and slightly reduced, about 30 minutes; stir in the cilantro. Remove 1/4 cup of the sauce and set aside until cool enough to add to the creme fraiche. Remove the ducks to a cutting board, let rest for 15 minutes and shred into bite-sized pieces. Put the meat in a bowl and toss with the sauce. Whisk together the creme fraiche, cooled reserved sauce and the lime zest and juice in a medium bowl. To assemble, spread some of the creme fraiche mixture on the top and bottom buns. Mound some of the duck on the bottom of the buns, top with some of the pickled green onions, put the bun tops on top and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 68356,&quot;Creamy Broccoli Stem Gratin 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for buttering the baking dish 1 large clove garlic, minced 1 1/4 pounds Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced (about 6) 2 bunches broccoli stems, peeled and thinly sliced (about 3 cups; see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves Pinch freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups grated Gruyere (about 8 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Rub the ribs all over with the five-spice powder; then season generously with salt and pepper. Put the ribs in a single layer in a roasting pan and slow-roast until they are almost tender, about 2 hours. Meanwhile make the glaze. In a large bowl combine the soy sauce, grapefruit juice, hoisin sauce, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, chili, garlic and ginger in a saucepan. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until the sauce reduces and thickens then remove from the heat. Strain the sauce and reserve. When the ribs are about 30 minutes away from being done, baste them with the teriyaki sauce. Cook until the meat pulls easily from the bone (about 1/2-inch of bone will show). Just before serving, preheat the broiler. Baste the ribs again with the teriyaki sauce and brown them under the broiler for 5 to 8 minutes. (Keep a close eye on these guys - ribs go from perfectly crisp to perfectly burnt in seconds.) Separate the ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife, pile them on a platter, and pour on the remaining sauce.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the flours, oats, baking powder, sugar and salt. Blend the cold butter in at the lowest speed and mix until the butter is in pea-size pieces. Combine the buttermilk, maple syrup and eggs and add quickly to the flour-and-butter mixture. Mix until just blended. The dough may be sticky. Dump the dough out onto a well-floured surface and be sure it is combined. Flour your hands and a rolling pin and roll the dough 3/4 to 1 inch thick. You should see lumps of butter in the dough. Cut into 3-inch rounds with a plain or fluted cutter and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with egg wash. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are crisp and the insides are done. To make the glaze, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, maple syrup and vanilla. When the scones are done, cool for 5 minutes and drizzle each scone with 1 tablespoon of the glaze. I like to sprinkle some uncooked oats on the top, for garnish.

Add 1 stick butter and pulse until combined. Add the remaining 2 sticks butter and pulse three times, or until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the vinegar, then gradually add 1/3 cup ice water through the feed tube, pulsing four times, until evenly combined. Squeeze the dough between your fingers. If it doesn&#39;t hold its shape, add up to 2 tablespoons ice water and pulse two more times (the dough should still be crumbly). Turn out onto a clean surface and press into a ball; divide in half, wrap in plastic wrap and flatten into two 1-inch-thick rectangles. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Make the filling: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until slightly brown, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and let cool. Slice the potatoes and apples very thinly; toss in a bowl with the thyme, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Line an 8-inch square baking dish with foil, leaving a 1-inch overhang on all sides. On a floured surface, roll out one piece of dough into a 12-inch square, about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to the prepared dish, tucking the dough into the edges and corners; do not trim the overhang. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the dough and add the onion. Lay the mortadella on top, then sprinkle with about one-third of the cheese. Layer half of the potatoes and apples on top in a single layer; Season with salt and pepper to taste, then sprinkle with another one-third of the cheese. Top with the remaining potatoes, apples; season again and finish with cheese. Roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch square and place on top of the filling. Press the overhang of the two crusts together, then roll the dough under itself and pinch to make a 3/4-inch-high edge. Make slits in the top crust with a knife to allow steam to escape. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Bake the pie until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, brush the crust with cream and continue baking until crisp, about 35 more minutes. Cool 25 minutes, then lift out of the pan and slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 68361,&quot;Mocha Served with Chiacchere Peanut oil or canola oil, for deep frying 1 1/2 cups flour, sifted 2 heaping tablespoons brown sugar 2 eggs 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons apple-flavored brandy (recommended: Calvados) Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting 4 Espressos 4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 4 tablespoons brown sugar 2 cups milk Pinch ground cayenne pepper or ground cinnamon, for topping mochas Instructions: Heat enough peanut oil to come halfway up the sides of a heavy-bottomed pot until an oil thermometer reads 375 degrees F or heat the oil in a deep fat fryer. To make the chiacchere: In a big bowl, combine the flour and brown sugar. Make a hole in the center of the mixture and pour in the eggs, unsalted butter and apple-flavored brandy. Carefully mix the center with a fork until the eggs are beaten. Slowly bring a bit of flour towards the center, keep doing this until all the flour is damp with egg mixture. Knead it together until you get a stiff dough. Add a bit of flour if dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball, cover it with a damp towel and let it sit for 1 hour. Roll out the dough about 1/8-inch thick. Use a pastry cutter to slice it into 1-inch wide by 5-inch long ribbons. Fry the ribbons in the oil until they become golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack set over a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Dust the fried dough with confectioners&#39; sugar. To make the mocha: Make 4 espressos. In a jar, combine the cocoa powder, brown sugar and 1/2 a cup of milk. Shake vigorously until smooth. Pour the chocolate mixture into a pot, add 1 1/2 cups milk and whisk together. Heat the chocolate mixture over medium-low heat. The second that it begins to steam, cover the pot and take it off of the heat. In a coffee bowl, pour together equal parts espresso and chocolate milk. Sprinkle with a pinch cayenne pepper or cinnamon. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 68362,&quot;Drumsticks en Croute 2 tablespoons dried oregano 1 tablespoon cl powder 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon salt 3 pounds chicken drumsticks 1 package filo dough, thawed 3 tablespoons honey Dijon mustard 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the spices and mix well. Rub the chicken evenly with the spice mixture and place on a baking sheet. Place in the oven and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove to cool. While chicken is cooling, unfold the filo, stacking the layers so the ends are aligned, and cut into 6-inch wide strips the length of the dough. Cover with a damp towel until ready to use. Once chicken is cool enough to handle, make a small slit in the leg and add about 1 to 2 teaspoons of the mustard. Working with 1 sheet of filo at a time, lightly brush with butter, top with another sheet, and lightly brush with butter again. Repeat so there are 3 to 4 layers of filo evenly stacked on top of one another. Roll 1 leg inside the stacked and brushed filo, leaving the bone end of the drumstick exposed. Brush lightly with butter and repeat with remaining filo and drumsticks. Return to the oven and bake until golden and crispy, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68363,&quot;Pig in a Biscuit 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 tablespoons sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/3 cup whole milk 1/4 cup sour cream 6 small breakfast (pork or chicken) sausages (about 8 ounces) Honey mustard Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar together in bowl. Rub in 2 tablespoons of butter until absorbed, and then rub in the remaining butter until mixture resembles coarse sand. Whisk the milk and sour cream into a liquid measuring cup; stir the sour cream and milk into the dry ingredients. Turn the dough out of the bowl and knead very lightly and flatten into a square. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 9 by 12-inch rectangle. Trim dough&#39;s rough edges with a pizza cutter or a knife, and then cut it in half lengthwise to make 2 rectangles. Lay 3 sausage links end to end, lengthwise, down the center of each piece of dough. Fold the dough over the sausages into long rolls with overlapping dough on the bottom. Slice each roll crosswise into 8 (1 1/2-inch) pieces. Transfer rolls to a baking sheet. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes.

Position the oven rack in the upper third of the oven. You may to shorten the cooking time slightly if the broiler rack is close to the heat. Quarter the lobsters, removing the tomalley and the roe if present. Place the pieces of lobster, shell side down, on a plate. Place the tomalley and roe in a small bowl. With a fork, break them into small pieces. Cover. Place a heavy 12-inch saute pan over the highest heat possible. Allow the pan to heat for 3 to 5 minutes until it becomes extremely hot. Add the oil and heat until it forms a film on the surface of the pan. Slide the lobster pieces, shell side down, into the hot oil. Using tongs, move the pieces in order to evenly sear all the shells. Because the lobster pieces are not flat, you will need to hold them with the tongs and press the shells into the hot oil to accomplish this. The claws need to be seared on only one side. When the shells have all turned bright red, which should take no longer than 2 minutes, turn the pieces over. The oil will also have taken on a beautiful red tinge. Add the tomalley and roe into the pan. Place the pan in the oven. If using the broiler, cook 2 minutes. If using the oven, cook for 3 minutes. The shells should be slightly browned, even a bit charred in places. Remove the pan from the oven and return it to the stove at maximum heat. Turn off the oven and put your plates in to warm. This will take only a minute. Warning: The handle of the pan will be red hot and will stay hot until the dish is complete. To avoid burns, wear oven mitts from now until the dish is complete. Add the shallots to the fat in the pan and stir. Add the bourbon and ignite. Shake the pan until the flames die down. Add the wine and let liquids in the pan reduce until the pan is almost dry. Turn the heat to low. Quickly remove the pieces of lobster and place, shell side down, on warm plates. Return the pan to the heat and add the butter, chervil, and chives. Swirl or stir the butter into the pan to create a creamy sauce with the pan juices. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use very little salt, if any, because the lobster adds its own salt. Spoon the sauce over the lobster pieces and serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 68376,&quot;Low-Fat Raspberry-Corn Muffins Cooking spray 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 2 cups low-fat buttermilk 1/2 cup apricot nectar 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 teaspoon orange zest 4 large egg whites 2 cups frozen raspberries<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners or 6-inch squares of parchment paper and mist with cooking spray.

Drizzle the oil over the pork and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Transfer the pork to a rack over a heavy-bottomed roasting pan. Roast the pork until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loin reads 140 degrees F, about 1 hour. Let the pork rest for 10 minutes. Set aside 1 1/4 pounds for the soup, cut into 1/2-inch chunks, and then reserve the rest for another recipe. For the soup: Roast the poblano over a flame until charred all over. Place the poblano in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap until it softens. Once cool enough to handle, remove the charred skin from the poblano as well as the stem and seeds. Cut into a 1/4-inch dice. Add the oil to a large Dutch oven or saucepot over medium heat. Add the onions and sweat until translucent and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and poblano and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the coriander and cumin and cook until slightly darkened and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the salsa verde and cook until it just comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Add the stock and bring back to a boil. Meanwhile prep all of your garnishes. Once the soup comes to a boil, continue to cook for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to develop. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. When you are ready to serve, add the roasted pork just to heat through. Serve over rice and with any or all garnishes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 68389,&quot;TD PB Crisp A-la Mode 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 cup sugar 1 small egg, beaten 1/2 cup butter, softened 3 tablespoons butter, softened 1 cup peanut butter 1 cup powdered sugar 1 cup oatmeal 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 cup brown sugar 4 tablespoons butter, softened 5 cups vanilla ice cream, softened 1 cup grape preserves 1/4 cup boysenberry syrup Instructions: Mix all of the dry ingredients, for the crust, together in a bowl.

Set aside and allow the mixture to cool to the touch, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the crust. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or crush using a rolling pin in a resealable plastic bag with the air taken out until they are evenly sized crumbs. Transfer the graham cracker crumbs to a bowl, add the sugar and mix until evenly combined. Next, pour in the melted butter and fold the mixture until the butter is distributed. It should be the texture of wet sand. Transfer the crumb mixture to a 9-inch pie pan, reserving a few pinches for garnishing the finished pie later. Press the crumbs into the bottom and sides of the pan to form a crust. Some will come up and over the top of the pan. When the marshmallow mixture has cooled, add the vanilla to the remaining heavy cream. Whip the cream by hand with a whisk or in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment to soft peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cooled marshmallow mixture. Transfer the filling to the prepared crust and smooth out with a spatula. Sprinkle with the reserved graham crumb mixture and dot with the maraschino cherries, putting one directly in the center.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour rum over raisins and microwave on high for 25 seconds to plump raisins (let sit 10 minutes). In a large bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar, and plumped raisins. In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil and egg whites, being sure to mix them well. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on work surface and lightly brush with the oil-egg white mixture.

Add the sugar, reduce to medium heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add the orange liqueur and orange sections. Set aside. In a pot, combine the orange zest and grenadine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 minutes. Set aside. Working in batches, gently place a crepe into the pan holding the orange juice and orange sections. Leave for 1 minute to absorb some juice. Using a narrow spatula, remove the crepe to a warm serving plate. Roll the crepe into a cylinder. Spoon on some orange sections. Using a fork, pick some orange zest from the grenadine syrup and distribute it over the crepe. Top with vanilla ice cream and serve immediately. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until the butter becomes brownish ? this gives it a nutty flavor. Don&#39;t let any of the butter turn black. Have a small bowl nearby so that you can pour off the butter as soon as it turns brown. Let cool. In a large mixing bowl (alternately, use a blender to mix all ingredients together), blend the sugar, cake flour, and salt. Add the eggs and whisk well. Whisk in the oil and the brown butter. Pour in about 1/2 cup milk and whisk ? the mixture should form a thick paste. Pour in the remaining milk a little at a time while mixing and then add the rum (or Grand Marnier or vanilla bean), and lemon zest. Heat the crepe pan over medium heat for about a minute. Cover the surface of the pan with clarified butter until it gets sizzling hot. Ladle some batter onto the middle of the 8-inch crepe pan and immediately start swirling the pan to distribute the batter over the surface. Pour the batter so that it&#39;s very thin on the pan ? and remember, move the pan, not the ladle. Cook the crepe for about 30 to 60 seconds (heat may vary) or until it&#39;s brown around the edge and dry in the center. Using a thin spatula (it resembles a long tongue depressor), flip the crepe quickly and cook for about 15 seconds. Using the spatula, remove the crepe to a warm plate. Sprinkle the crepe with sugar. Repeat with the remaining batter.

Prepare the cake mix as directed; pour into the bowl. Bake at 325 degrees F until a toothpick comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool completely. Unmold the cake from the bowl and position rounded-side down. Using a long serrated knife, trim off the domed top to make the cake level. Use a small serrated knife to cut a circle into the top of the cake, about 3/4 inch in from the edge and 1 1/2 inches deep. Use your fingers or a fork to pull out the cake in the middle. Flip the cake over and place on a cardboard circle or plate lined with wax paper. Cover the rounded side with frosting, leaving the flat base unfrosted. Cut out a small cardboard circle and place on the unfrosted base. Flip the cake over onto another piece of wax paper. Frost the lip and the inside of the cake (the inside doesn&#39;t have to be perfect-it will be covered with ice cream). Transfer to the freezer until the frosting sets, 30 minutes. Dip an offset spatula in hot water and wipe dry; smooth out the frosting. Microwave the ice cream until softened but not melted. Scoop into the cavity of the cake and smooth with the spatula.

Throw the flour and 2 teaspoons salt into a sifter and sift them straight into the bowl. Whisk until it&#39;s nice and smooth, then refrigerate until the prime rib is ready. After the beef is removed from the pan, increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Use a slotted spoon to remove the peppercorns, herbs and excess salt from the drippings. Pour the remaining drippings into a separate container. They should be speckled and lovely! Pour a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon or so) of the drippings into each cup of a standard muffin pan and place the pan in the hot oven for a couple of minutes, or until just before the drippings begin to smoke. Carefully remove the pan from the oven and immediately fill the muffin cups about 1/2 to 2/3 full. Bake 13 to 14 minutes, or until they&#39;ve \\popped\\ about as much as they can pop. Serve them in a basket with a pretty napkin right next to the prime rib. Move the oven rack to the bottom and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, then start with the seasoning: Grab the peppercorns and throw them in a big plastic bag and pound them with a rolling pin to break them open. Pull the leaves off the rosemary and thyme sprigs. Throw the crushed peppercorns into a bowl with the salt and herb leaves and add the minced garlic. Use your fingers to toss it all together, then set it aside. Place the beef, fat-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Drizzle the olive oil all over the surface and rub it in with your hands. Sprinkle the peppercorn-herb-salt mixture all over the surface of the beef, pressing it lightly with your hands. Roast the beef 45 minutes for the first stage. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and insert a meat thermometer sideways into the roast. Roast the beef an additional 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the thermometer registers 120 degrees F to 135 degrees F in the center for medium rare. (The meat will continue to cook for a bit after you remove it from the oven.) Remove the beef from the rack and let it rest about 15 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.

Slice roast tableside. Preheat a hotel pan or heavy metal baking dish in a 375 oven. Toss the potatoes, garlic, olive oil, and chervil with salt and pepper. When the pan is hot, add the potatoes. They should sizzle. Roast until they turn brown, then turn oven down to 350 degrees. Cook for about 30 minutes or until a knife easily pierces the spuds. Mix the 2 powders together and add enough water to make a paste. Mix in the sugar and Dijon. Serve in a small side dish. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 68422,&quot;Cinnamon Crumble Buns 5 cups bread flour, plus up to 1/2 cup more if needed 3/4 cup plain instant mashed potato flakes, pulsed fine in a food processor 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon instant yeast 2 teaspoons fine sea salt 1 3/4 cups whole milk, at room temperature<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the baking pan<br> Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature<br> Crumble, frozen, recipe follows 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 5 cups all-purpose flour 1 pound unsalted butter, melted 1 cup brown sugar<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> Instructions: For the dough: Whisk together the bread flour, mashed potato flakes, granulated sugar, cinnamon, yeast and salt in a large bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the milk, vanilla and eggs; whisk to break up the eggs. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until the dough just comes together. Add the butter, one piece at a time, mixing until incorporated. Continue to mix until the dough comes together in a ball. If the dough is sticking a lot to the sides of the bowl, add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until most of the dough no longer sticks. (A little sticking to the bottom of the bowl, beneath the hook, is fine. Adding too much flour will make the buns dry, so use a light hand.) Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand until shiny and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. (The dough should be very soft but not wet and sticky; a little tacky is OK.) Place the dough in a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray; lightly spray the top of the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm corner of your kitchen until doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes. For the filling: Stir together the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Roll the dough out into a long rectangle, about 10-by-21 inches. Brush with the melted butter, then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar, followed by 4 cups of frozen Crumble. Starting from a long side, roll the dough into a jelly roll. Cut the log into 2-inch pieces and place, cut-side down, in a buttered 10-inch square baking pan. Sprinkle 1 cup of Crumble over the top. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy and nearly doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns, loosely wrapped in foil, for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until golden brown on top, about 5 more minutes. For the glaze: Meanwhile, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl and stir until smooth. While the buns are still warm (but not hot), drizzle with the glaze. Serve warm. Combine the all-purpose flour, melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar and salt in a large bowl. Stir together and then work with a spoon or your fingers until the butter is absorbed and the mixture forms clumps. Place in a resealable plastic bag and freeze until needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 68423,&quot;Trout in Puff Pastry 12 (4-ounce) trout fillets, skin removed or 6 whole trout, cleaned, scaled, filleted and skinned Salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves 1 pound fresh pike fillets, skin removed 2 eggs 2 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 pounds puff pastry Chive Butter Sauce, recipe follows 4 shallots, minced 1/2 bunch tarragon, cleaned and leaves chopped 1 cup white wine 1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 cup heavy cream 3/4 pound butter 1 lemon, juiced Salt and pepper 2 bunches chives, minced Instructions: Season the trout with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the tarragon. Reserve in the refrigerator. To make the fish mousse: Puree the pike in a food processor. Add 1 egg, mix well, and with the motor running, add the cream. Refrigerate for 2 hours. Divide the pastry dough in half and roll out each piece so it is approximately 1/3 inch thick. Cut the pastry into 12 equal pieces that are all slightly larger then the fish fillets. Place half of the pastry pieces on a baking sheet. Place 1 fish fillet in the center of each piece of pastry, skin-side down. Spread the chilled mousse over the fillets and cover with another fillet, skin-side up. Lightly beat the remaining egg for egg wash. Brush the pastry around the edge of the fish and cover with a second sheet of pastry. Press the layers of pastry around the edges of the fish to seal. Trim the pastry following the outlines of the fish, and use the leftover dough to decorate the fish with scales, an eye, and gills. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When ready, bake the fish for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the center of the mousse is hot (when you insert a skewer in the center for 1 minute, it should be hot when touched to the lip). Sprinkle fish with remaining 1 tablespoon tarragon. Serve the fish with Chive Butter Sauce. In a saucepan, combine shallots, tarragon, wine, and thyme. Reduce until only 1/4 cup of the liquid remains. Add the cream and reduce until the mixture thickens slightly. Slowly whisk in the butter, 1 small piece at a time. Add the lemon juice, salt, and pepper, to taste. Strain the sauce into a small saucepan and stir in the chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68424,&quot;Gingerbread People Truffles 2 cups finely crushed gingersnap cookie crumbs 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled<br> 1 packed tablespoon light brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon molasses Heavy cream, for loosening the batter<br> 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice<br> 8 ounces semisweet chocolate or chocolate chips, chopped 2 tablespoons coconut oil<br> 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 2 tablespoons meringue powder<br> 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> Red and green food coloring, for decorating<br> Instructions: For the gingerbread truffles: Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with plastic wrap to extend over the sides by several inches. Combine the gingersnap crumbs, butter, brown sugar, molasses and pumpkin pie spice in a food processor and pulse to combine. (You may add a little of the cream to get the mixture more malleable.) Spread the mixture into the baking pan, cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and press it smooth with your hands. Refrigerate 4 hours. For coating and decorating the truffles: Set a wire rack over a parchment-lined baking sheet. Using the plastic overhang as handles, remove the truffle mixture in one piece. Flip onto your work surface and remove the plastic so the smoothest side faces up. Use a 1 1/2-inch gingerbread person cutter to cut out 12 gingerbread men. (After cutting the gingerbread men, you may roll the extra truffle mixture into balls for round truffles, if desired.) Place the gingerbread men (and truffle balls, if making) on the rack and place in the freezer while you melt the chocolate. Melt the chocolate and coconut oil in a medium bowl at 50 percent power in the microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until completely smooth, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes total. Allow the chocolate to cool 20 minutes. Put a gingerbread man, smooth-side up, on a fork, and spoon the chocolate over, lightly tapping the fork to let the excess drip back into the bowl to achieve a smooth coating of chocolate. Return the gingerbread person to the rack and repeat with the remaining men (and truffle balls, if desired). Refrigerate while you prepare the royal icing for decoration. For the royal icing, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk to combine. With the mixer on low speed, add the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons water and mix until smooth, then scrape down the sides of the bowl and add about 1 tablespoon more water, a little at a time, to make an icing that drizzles slowly from a spoon dipped into the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until the icing is very smooth, about 1 minute. Spoon a third of the icing into a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip. (Alternatively, transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner.) Divide the rest of the icing between 2 small bowls, using food coloring to color one red and one green. Transfer the icing to 2 more piping bags, fitted with small plain tips (#3 or #4) or resealable plastic bags. (You will have icing left over.) Decorate the gingerbread men (and truffle balls, if desired) with the royal icing. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 68425,&quot;Sausage Balls 1 pound ground pork sausage, such as Jimmy Dean, at room temperature (see Cook\\u2019s Note) 2 cups biscuit baking mix, such as Bisquick (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, optional<br> One 8-ounce package sharp Cheddar, grated Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment.

In a bowl, stir to combine sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon; set aside. Open can of biscuits and separate into individual biscuits. Sprinkle a rolling surface with some of the sugar-spice mixture. One at a time, press each biscuit into the bowl of sugar-spice mixture. Roll each biscuit on sugared surface to a 5-inch diameter. Using 2-inch and/or 3-inch leaf cutters, cut leaf shapes for your wreath; reserve dough scraps. Position leaves overlapping around the circle drawn on parchment. Set aside. Lightly beat egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Using a pastry brush, paint egg wash between the leaves where they overlap. Re-roll extra dough to cut out single leaf shapes or to make mini individual wreaths. Bake in preheated oven for 14 to 17 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely before moving. While wreath is baking, stir together sifted powdered sugar and maple syrup until smooth. Cover and set aside. Once wreath has cooled, use a clean paint brush to apply glaze to leaves - painting every other leaf so that there is separation. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 68428,&quot;Chickpea Soup 1 cup dried chickpeas, washed and soaked overnight in 10 cups water 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic, mashed to a paste 2 onions, finely diced 1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro Salt and pepper to taste 1 teaspoon dry mustard Cayenne Instructions: In a saucepan bring chickpeas and soaking water to a boil.

Butter and flour a 12 x 18 x 1-inch baking sheet. Melt together the butter, 1 pound of chocolate chips, and the unsweetened chocolate in a medium bowl over simmering water. Allow to cool slightly. In a large bowl, stir (do not beat) together the eggs, coffee granules, vanilla, and sugar. Stir the warm chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and allow to cool to room temperature. In a medium bowl, sift together 1 cup of flour, the baking powder, and salt. Add to the cooled chocolate mixture. Toss the walnuts and 12 ounces of chocolate chips in a medium bowl with 1/4 cup of flour, then add them to the chocolate batter. Pour into the baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes, then rap the baking sheet against the oven shelf to force the air to escape from between the pan and the brownie dough. Bake for about 15 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Do not overbake! Allow to cool thoroughly, refrigerate, and cut into 20 large squares. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 68436,&quot;Bacon-Wrapped Bread Sticks 1 pound high-quality bacon strips 1 large package grissini-style bread sticks 1 box dark brown sugar Instructions: Cut bacon strips in half and lay them out on a cutting board. Break the bread sticks into 4-inch lengths. Sprinkle the bacon with brown sugar so that the bacon is completely coated. Press the sugar onto the bacon with your fingers. Continue to sprinkle sugar and press it on until no more sugar will adhere. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Set a rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. Roll the bacon strips, sugar side in, around the bread sticks in a spiral fashion. Be sure to begin as close to the bread stick edge as possible and roll very tightly. Place seam side down on the rack. Bake about 20 minutes, but watch carefully so that the sugar doesn&#39;t burn in the last minutes of cooking. Remove them from the oven and let rest for an hour on the rack to become firm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68437,&quot;Chicken and the Bodacious Bulb 1 (4 to 5-pound) chicken, organic if possible 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more for sprinkling 2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 cup Garlic Oil, divided, plus 1 tablespoon, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups cloves garlic, reserved from Garlic Oil 8 sprigs fresh thyme 1 onion, peeled and quartered 1 carrot, peeled and cut into 4 pieces 1 celery stalk, trimmed and cut into 4 pieces 2 1/2 cups chicken stock, plus more to loosen fond and thicken gravy 2 cups water 6 large cloves garlic, sliced thin 1/2 cup flour 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons seeded and diced Roma tomatoes 2 cups olive oil 2 cups garlic cloves Instructions: Rinse and pat the chicken dry. On a stable surface, cut the chicken with a sharp knife into 8 pieces, plus the backbone. Season all the pieces with 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate all but the backbone. In a large saucepan or small stockpot over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of garlic oil and, when hot, add in the seasoned chicken backbone. Brown for 4 to 5 minutes, then add in the reserved garlic cloves, thyme, and the cut vegetables. Turn the backbone over and continue to cook until well browned, an additional 5 minutes. (Guy&#39;s tip: for easy removal when making gravy later, tie the garlic cloves in cheesecloth before adding to the pot). Deglaze the pan with a little of the stock to loosen the fond from the bottom of the pan, and add the remaining stock and the water. Bring to a strong simmer and let cook for 45 minutes. Strain the solids but reserve the garlic cloves in a bowl. Let sit and skim the fat from the top. Set aside. You should have about 3 cups. This can be prepared ahead. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. In a large, deep-sided pan over high heat, add 1/4 cup of the garlic oil. When it just starts to smoke, add the sliced garlic cloves and cook until just crisp and light golden brown, 30 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with a touch of salt. Add in the chicken and carefully brown the pieces, turning as needed, and getting a nice even dark golden brown on all sides. As the pieces finish, remove to a baking sheet and hold warm in the oven. Drain the excess fat from the pan the chicken was cooked in and set heat at medium-high. Add in the remaining 1/4 cup garlic oil and the flour and stir constantly until a paste forms. Allow the roux to cook for 1 to 2 minutes, with continued stirring, and then slowly whisk in the stock. Add about 1/2 cup at a time and continue to incorporate. Reduce the heat to low once the mixture has thickened and then add in the reserved cooked garlic cloves. Whisk these into the roux, adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed, and hold warm until service over low heat. Place 1/2 cup of the garlic gravy on a plate and position a couple pieces of chicken on top. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the gravy on top of the chicken and garnish with the parsley, diced tomatoes, and the fried garlic slices. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add half of the oil and all of the garlic. Heat through and cook for 10 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed. Allow to cool to room temperature. In a 16-ounce clean glass jar, add the prepared garlic and the remaining oil. Cover and refrigerate. Use within 2 to 3 weeks. Guy&#39;s Tips: Use a good quality olive oil in this, but not extra-virgin. You want an olive oil that can withstand some heat, as you will soon be cooking everything with this oil! Find the freshest, firmest, whitest garlic bulbs you can find. Gently break apart the bulb, and then carefully trim the stem end from each clove and peel the skins. Be picky, use the biggest ones and leave the smaller ones for another recipe. Use the oil for cooking, use the garlic for everything.

Then with the processor running, drizzle in the cold vodka 1 tablespoon at a time until it forms into a ball. Take it out and divide in half. Place on a piece of plastic wrap and pat each piece into a disk. Wrap and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out 1 piece of pie crust on a lightly floured surface slightly larger than your pie tin. (Reserve the other half for another use.) Place into the tin, trim the edges and crimp the edges decoratively. Place a piece of parchment inside the pie shell, fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the pie weights and continue to bake until the pie crust is golden brown, another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the crust to cool completely. For the filling: Combine the sweetened condensed milk, lime juice, sour cream, egg yolks and lime zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed for 2 minutes. Scrape the filling into your cooled pie crust. Bake until the filling only wiggles a bit in the center when you gently shake the pan back and forth, 15 to 20 minutes. Don&#39;t allow the pie to brown. Cool the pie on your counter for at least 15 minutes, then place in the freezer for an hour. For the whipped cream: Put the cream cheese, powdered sugar, tequila and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Whip on high speed until creamy and smooth. Scrape down the mixing bowl. Add the cream and start on low speed to incorporate, and then turn to high speed and whip until stiff peaks form. Scrape the whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip and decorate your chilled pie.

Meanwhile, combine the kombu and 6 cups cold water in a medium saucepan and let sit for about 30 minutes. (You can skip this step if you are short on time, but it does lend a little extra flavor.) Heat over medium heat until the water comes to a near boil, but doesn\\u2019t actually boil, about 10 minutes. Discard the kombu. Sprinkle the katsuobushi evenly over the water, bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately remove from the heat. Let steep for about 10 minutes without stirring. Pour the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer into a small saucepan. Do not press down on the katsuobushi, which can make the dashi cloudy and bitter. Stir in the mirin, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, ginger and 1 teaspoon salt. Check the seasonings (the broth should be a bit \\u201cstrong;\\u201d it will get a little diluted when you add the other ingredients). Bring to a simmer, cover and keep hot. Cook the soba in one of the pots of boiling water about 30 seconds less than the package directions. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to remove any excess starch. Shake off any excess water, then divide the noodles among 4 deep bowls and set aside (if possible, warm the bowls first). Season the water in the second pot with salt, add the bok choy stems and boil for about 30 seconds. Add the bok choy leaves, shrimp and leek and cook until the shrimp is just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a colander. Divide the vegetables and shrimp among the bowls of noodles. Ladle the hot broth over the top and garnish with the radishes and sesame seeds.

Drain the mushrooms, then combine in a pot with 2 cups water; bring to a boil and cook until hydrated and plump, about 5 minutes. Strain the mushroom broth into a separate pot (just the broth will be used to make the rice). Set the broth aside. (If using bouillon cubes, boil the cubes with 2 cups water until dissolved.) Season the shrimp with the adobo seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, half of the garlic, the green bell pepper, scallions and thyme. Puncture 1 Scotch bonnet with the whole cloves (so they don\\u2019t get lost in the rice) and add to the pot. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Add the lima beans to the pot, then add the reserved mushroom broth and 2 more cups water. Bring to a boil. Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste. Add 1 tablespoon butter and let melt. Add the rice and gently stir with a fork to evenly spread. Rapidly simmer until the water is evaporated, about 10 minutes.<br> Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with foil and place a lid on top of the foil (this allows the rice to steam); secure the lid so no air can circulate in or out of the pot.

Place the chicken breasts in between plastic wrap and pound lightly with the flat side of a meat mallet to flatten and even out the chicken. Reserve. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil, add the onions and sprinkle with salt and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat and cook the onions until they are soft and very aromatic but have no color, 7 to 8 minutes. Toss in the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Crumble the chorizo and add to the pan. Cook the chorizo until it is cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly. Transfer the chorizo mixture to a mixing bowl and stir in the breadcrumbs, Manchego, parsley, almonds and egg. Taste to make sure the stuffing is delicious. Divide the filling among the 4 chicken breasts. Make a log of stuffing across the widest part of the chicken breast. Fold the ends over the stuffing and roll the chicken up to enclose the stuffing. Secure the rolls shut with a toothpick. For the breading: Set up a standard breading procedure with 3 bowls: 1 with flour, 1 with 2 eggs beaten together with 2 tablespoons water and 1 with the panko breadcrumbs. Dust each chicken roll lightly with flour, then dip in the egg wash and then roll in the panko. Once all the chicken rolls have been breaded, let them hang out in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add olive oil to a large, straight-sided saute pan until it reaches a depth of 1/2-inch and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. Brown the chicken rolls on all sides. When the chicken is brown, remove from the pan and blot on paper towels. Transfer the rolls to a sheet tray and place in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes. For the sauce: Add a few drops of oil to a saute pan and add the shallots. Sprinkle with salt and bring the pan to a medium heat. Cook the shallots for 3 to 4 minutes and then add the sherry vinegar. Reduce the vinegar by half. Add half the chicken stock, season with salt and bring it to a boil. When the stock has reduced by half, add the remaining stock and reduce by half again. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed (it probably will). Turn the heat to medium and swirl in 1 pat of butter at a time. Remove the chicken from the oven, slice each roll into 4 or 5 slices, plate and spoon the sauce over.

Make the sauce. In the same pan, add the mushrooms and cook until they are wilted and slightly darkened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the onions, garlic and thyme. Season with a pinch of salt and more than a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring constantly (to protect the garlic from browning), until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the flour evenly over the top and stir until the flour disappears. Continue to stir for a few more minutes. In a liquid measuring cup or bowl, whisk together the yogurt, horseradish and Worcestershire sauce. Slowly pour the beef stock into the yogurt mixture, whisking, making sure to whisk out any clumps. Pour this mixture over the sauted vegetables in the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, whisking constantly, until incorporated and thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. The sauce will break at first, but it will come together as it thickens and is whisked to emulsify. Add the seared beef back to the pan and stir. Prepare the noodles and serve. In a large bowl, toss the noodles with the parsley. Serve in shallow, wide bowls, with egg noodles on the bottom and topped with a scoop of the sauce and beef cubes. Garnish with a sprinkle of parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68481,&quot;Chicken Bouillabaisse 1 (4-to 5-pound) chicken, cut into 8 to 10 pieces Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary leaves Good olive oil 1 large head garlic, separated into cloves and peeled 1 teaspoon saffron threads 1 teaspoon whole fennel seeds 1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree 1 1/2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade 1 cup dry white wine 3 tablespoons Pernod 1 pound baby Yukon Gold potatoes, halved Rouille, for serving (recipe follows) Crusty French bread, for serving 4 large garlic cloves 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 extra-large egg yolk, at room temperature 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 cup good olive oil Instructions: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season it generously with salt, pepper, and the rosemary. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in a large Dutch oven and brown the chicken pieces in batches until nicely browned all over, about 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Transfer the browned chicken pieces to a plate and set aside. Lower the heat to medium-low and add the garlic, saffron, fennel seeds, tomato puree, chicken stock, white wine, Pernod, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper to the pot. Stir and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom, and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, until the garlic is very tender, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Carefully pour the sauce into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Puree until smooth. Return the sauce to the Dutch oven and add the potatoes and browned chicken pieces with their juices. Stir carefully. Cover the pot and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is done. Check the seasonings and serve hot in shallow bowls with big dollops of rouille and slices of crusty bread. Place the garlic and salt on a cutting board and mince together. Transfer the mixture to a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Add the egg yolk, lemon juice, saffron, and red pepper flakes. Process until smooth. With the machine running, pour the olive oil in a thin, steady stream through the feed tube to make a thick mayonnaise emulsion. Transfer the rouille to a serving bowl and store it in the refrigerator until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 68482,&quot;Lollipop Love Hand Pie Bouquet 230 grams (1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 125 grams (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cubed<br> 25 grams (2 tablespoons) vegetable shortening 25 grams (2 tablespoons) superfine sugar, plus more for sprinkling Pinch salt<br> 50 milliliters (3 tablespoons) ice water<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons raspberry jam 1 egg, whisked Instructions: For the pie dough: Place the flour, butter, shortening, sugar and salt into a large mixing bowl. Rub the mixture between your fingers and thumbs repeatedly until the lumps of butter are much smaller and the entire mixture has a breadcrumb-like texture. This should take 2 to 3 minutes. Next, slowly pour in the ice water (you may not need all of it), mixing it into the dough with your hands as you pour. Add just enough water to the point where all the flour on the bottom of the bowl has been absorbed, the dough has formed into a rough ball and the bowl appears clean. Once you&#39;ve incorporated the water, place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it with your hands 2 to 3 times; gently shape into a flat disc. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow to chill in the fridge for 1 hour. The dough can be kept in the fridge for up to 2 days. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C/350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Once the dough has chilled, place it onto a lightly floured work surface. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out evenly until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 16 discs of dough. If you do not have enough dough to cut 16, simply re-roll the scraps of dough and cut out the remaining discs. Place the discs onto the prepared baking sheet. For the filling: Use a small heart-shaped cookie cutter (roughly 1/4 inch wide, but you can make the hearts as big as you want!) to cut hearts out of the center of 8 of the discs. On each of the remaining 8 discs, place 3/4 teaspoon of jam in the middle and lightly egg wash the edges with a pastry brush. Place a 5-inch lollipop stick into the center of each jam disc. Place a heart disc of dough on top of a jam-covered disc. Gently press the discs together at the edges, sealing them against the egg-washed edge. Using a spare lollipop stick, seal the 2 pieces of dough together by pressing the edge of the lollipop stick into the dough to create a small indentation of the stick all the way around the outside of the disc. Repeat with the remaining discs. Lightly egg wash the top of the discs, then sprinkle a pinch of sugar over the top of each. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. To serve, place a Styrofoam ball into the bottom of a flower pot or vase. Using a skewer, gently pierce a hole in the ball, then take a cooled pie pop and push the lollipop stick into the hole you just created. Repeat, creating holes all over the ball until you have filled it with you pie pops. Using some pink ribbon, tie a small bow around the outside of the flower pot and serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 68483,&quot;Dashi 6 cups cold water One 12-inch long piece of kombu, wiped with a damp cloth 1 package shaved dried bonito flakes (0.88-ounce/25 grams) Instructions: In a saucepan, combine the water and kombu.

Whisk in the Marsala and Sherry. Fill a large bowl 1/4 full of ice water set aside. Place first bowl over a pot of boiling water and whisk the egg mixture vigorously for about 5 minutes, until it is thick and tripled in volume. Immediately put over bowl of ice water and whisk until cold. Fold in whipped cream. Refrigerate until ready for use. Sponge cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of two 12- x 18-inch jelly roll pans with parchment paper. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Put the yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Using the whisk attachment, whip on high speed until thick and pale yellow. Reduce to medium speed and slowly add the water and the vanilla. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl. Return to high speed and continue whipping for about 5 minutes, until mixture is thick and ribbony. Fold the dry ingredients into the sugar egg mixture. Put the egg whites in a separate bowl of the mixer. With a clean dry whisk attachment, whip the egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Fold half the egg whites into the batter and then fold in remaining whites. Divide batter between the two pans and spread out evenly. Bake for 15 minutes, until golden brown and springs back when lightly touched. Assembly: Cut the sponge cakes into three 9-inch round circles and then cut each in half horizontally, to make six 9-inch circles. You will need 5 for this recipe. (Freeze others for later use.) Put a cake circle in bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Top the cake layer with 1 1/4 cups of zabaglione. Continue layering cake and zabaglione in this manner, ending with a layer of cake. Refrigerate the cake for 1 to 2 hours to allow to set. Unmold the cake by running a hot dry knife around the edge of the pan and then releasing the latch on the springform. Put the heavy cream and the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. With the whisk attachment, whip on high speed until soft peaks form. Frost the sides and top of the cake. Decorate the top with chocolate shavings and sides with crushed amaretto cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68488,&quot;Mickey and Minnie Cupcakes 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 1 cup red candy melts 1/4 cup white candy melts 36 chocolate sandwich cookies 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 2 tablespoons milk 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar and beat until creamy, about 4 more minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until just combined. Divide the batter among the muffin cups. Bake until the tops spring back when gently pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the cupcakes to a rack and let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then remove to the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the bows: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the red candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip a small corner. Pipe 2 1/2-inch bows onto the parchment (make a few extra bows in case some break). Put the white candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth; let cool slightly. Transfer to another resealable plastic bag and snip a small corner. Pipe white dots on the bows; let set, 15 to 20 minutes. Make the topping: Finely grind 24 cookies in a food processor; transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Wipe out the food processor. Make the frosting: Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Pulse the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar, melted chocolate, cocoa powder, milk and vanilla in the food processor until smooth. Spread on the cupcakes. Dip the cupcakes in the cookie crumbs, pressing to adhere. Separate the remaining 12 sandwich cookies; arrange 2 halves upright on each cupcake for the ears, pressing the cookies into the frosting. Carefully lift the bows off the parchment; lean them up against the cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 68489,&quot;Pork Tenderloin with Guava Barbeque Sauce 3 pork tenderloins (1 to 1 1/2 pounds each) 1/2 bottle red wine 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar 6 garlic cloves, peeled Olive oil or vegetable oil for grilling Guava Barbeque Sauce, recipe follows Papaya Salsa, recipe follows 12 ounces guava paste, cut into small cubes 1/4 cup red wine 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 garlic cloves, minced 4 tablespoons honey 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups papaya, cubed into 1/2-inch squares 1 Hass avocado, cut into small pieces 2 tablespoons diagonally sliced scallions 1/4 cup lemon juice Pinch sugar Pinch salt Instructions: Marinate the pork overnight in the wine, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Preheat the grill on high. When hot, brush the pork tenderloins with olive oil and sear each side for about a minute. Lower the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes per side, brushing generously with the guava barbeque sauce at least twice. Remove the pork tenderloins from the heat, glaze with another thick coat of the barbeque sauce, and let rest on a plate for at least 5 minutes. Then slice the tenderloins into 1-inch medallions. The pork should be served warm with a side of papaya salsa. In a small saucepan, combine all the sauce ingredients. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until the guava paste dissolves and the ingredients combine to form a thick, syrupy sauce, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature.

Add the celery and onion and cook, stirring often, until softened but not brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with the sage, bouillon cubes and 1 teaspoon pepper and stir in 1/4 cup water. Cook, stirring often, until the bouillon is dissolved and has coated all the vegetables and the water has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook on low speed, stir in the warm water and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, mixing until the flour is completely moistened. Let stand 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt and knead on medium speed for 5 minutes. (The dough will tighten up, then begin to relax. After 5 minutes, it will be very wet and stick to the bottom of the mixer but not the sides.) With the mixer on low, add the cooled vegetables and the parsley. Rub 2 tablespoons olive oil around the bottom and sides of a large mixing bowl (big enough to hold at least double the volume of the dough). Using a scraper or spatula, transfer the dough to the bowl, flipping once to coat completely with oil. Cover with a plate and let sit until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with the back of a spoon, until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool to room temperature. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil into the bottom of an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Use your hands to evenly distribute the oil along the bottom and up the sides. Scrape the dough into the baking sheet, flattening it slightly with your hands. Flip the dough once and gently stretch it to fit into an even layer in the baking sheet. (The dough may not stretch to the edges at this point. If it starts to pull back, let rest 10 minutes and re-stretch, making sure to pull from the center as well as the edges to get an even thickness.) Top evenly with the sausage and use your fingertips to make dimples over the surface of the focaccia, pressing firmly but not so hard you make holes in the dough. For the brine and finish: Dissolve 1 teaspoon kosher salt in 1/4 cup warm water. Drizzle over the surface of the focaccia, letting it pool in the dimples. Cover with an inverted baking sheet or cover loosely with plastic wrap that has been lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Let sit in a warm place for 45 minutes to relax and rise again. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Uncover the dough and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake, rotating the baking sheet once halfway through, until the focaccia is deep golden brown on the top and bottom, 30 to 35 minutes. Drizzle with the olive oil and let sit for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to remove the focaccia to a wire rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68494,&quot;Grilled Broccolini 1 large bunch broccolini 2 tablespoons olive oil Red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 lemon Shaved Parmesan, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.

Add the sausage and fry, stirring often, until browned on most sides, 6 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.<br> The aromatics and braising liquid: Pour off and discard the fat from the pan. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper and saute, stirring, until the onion begins to soften and brown on the edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, stir and saute for another minute, until fragrant. Add the white wine, stir and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, and boil until the wine is reduced by about half, about 4 minutes. Add the vinegar, stir, and boil for a minute or two. Add the stock and bring to a simmer.<br> The braise: Season the pork all over with salt and pepper. Add the chops to the skillet, and immediately reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. One by one, tear the peppers into small pieces, discard the seeds and stems, and adding the pieces to the skillet. (I like to hold them over the skillet while I tear them so that the juices fall directly into the pan. The only trouble with this approach is that a few errant seeds will fall in too, making the dish spicier still. If you&#39;d prefer to minimize the peppers&#39; heat, tear them over a cutting board so that any juices drip onto the board, then scrape every last seed to the side, and add the peppers and as much of the juices as you like to the skillet.) Cover the skillet and braise the pork quietly, checking after 5 minutes to see that the liquid is not simmering too furiously. If it is, lower the heat or set a heat diffuser beneath the pan. After 20 minutes, turn the pork with tongs. Continue to braise at a gentle simmer until the pork is fork-tender, about 40 minutes total.<br> The finish: Transfer the chops to a platter or plates and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Bring the cooking juices to a boil over medium-high heat. Skim any surface fat with a large spoon. Boil until the juices are tasty and slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Lower the heat to a simmer, add the sausage to the sauce, and simmer for about 3 minutes to heat through. Taste for salt and pepper. Spoon over the pork and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 68496,&quot;Potatoes in Cartoccio 3 pounds small red-skinned potatoes, scrubbed well and quartered 2 ounces pancetta, sliced very thin 2 sprigs sage, leaves picked Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat a grill on medium-high to high heat. Tear 2 squares of heavy-duty aluminum foil, approximately 20 by 20 inches, and lay them side by side and flat on a work surface. Divide the potatoes and layer them evenly on each piece of foil with the pancetta, sage, salt and pepper. Fold up the sides slightly to form a bowl shape. Drizzle with the olive oil (about 2 tablespoon per pouch). Secure the tops of the pouches by folding over the foil to seal in the steam and keep the olive oil from leaking out.<br> Cook on the shelf of the grill for 20 minutes, or over direct heat for 10 minutes and indirect heat (with half of the burners ignited on the grill or coals pushed to one side) for another 10 minutes. When done, the potatoes should be tender and cooked through, with some of them beginning to caramelize on the bottom of the pouch.<br> Being careful of the steam inside the pouch, open the pouch and transfer to a serving vessel--or serve from the aluminum foil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 68497,&quot;Garlic Mashed Potatoes 1 head garlic 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks<br> 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, hot, plus more if needed 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> Flaky sea salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Slice the top third off the head of garlic. Place on a piece of aluminum foil and drizzle with the olive oil. Sprinkle with the thyme leaves and some kosher salt and pepper, then place the top back on the garlic. Wrap in the foil and roast until the garlic is brown and very soft, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cover the potatoes with cold water in a large pot. Add 1 tablespoon of kosher salt to the water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, about 15 minutes. Simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, another 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the hot chicken broth.

Grind the toasted spices along with the cardamom pods, nutmeg and red pepper flakes in a spice grinder until fine, about 1 minute. Transfer roughly two-thirds of the spice mixture (about 2 tablespoons plus 2 1/2 teaspoons), the yogurt, 1 teaspoon of the salt and the turkey thighs to a 1-gallon zip-top bag. Seal the bag, squish to fully coat the thighs and refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours. Place a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the canola oil and when shimmering, add the onion and the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the ginger, garlic and chiles. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is evenly brown, 7 to 8 minutes more. Add the remaining spice mixture and the tomatoes and cook until reduced and darkened in color, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk and lime juice. Kill the heat and cover to keep warm. Park a grill pan over medium heat for 5 minutes, then lightly brush with oil. Remove the turkey from the bag, keeping as much yogurt on the meat as possible, and grill until the yogurt is well-charred, approximately 5 minutes per side. Remove the thighs from the heat and rest for 5 minutes before cutting into bite-sized pieces. Add the turkey pieces to the sauce and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 20 minutes, taking care to not let the sauce boil as the yogurt may curdle. To serve, spoon over basmati or jasmine rice and garnish with fresh mint and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 68499,&quot;Asparagus, Cherry Pepper and Bacon Quiche Store-bought or Homemade Pie Dough, recipe follows 1/3 cup chopped roasted asparagus 1/3 cup roughly chopped jarred cherry peppers 1/3 cup sauteed sliced onions 1/2 cup crumbled cooked bacon 3/4 to 1 cup shredded jarlsberg cheese 3 large eggs 1 1/4 cups heavy cream, half-and-half or milk Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon paprika or cl powder, or some grated lemon zest (optional) 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, diced and chilled 4 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or white vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. Cut a piece of 2 colors. Make into 2 big cigars. Combine the 2 colors by twisting them around each other. Roll to a thickness of about 1/2-inch. Use the scissors to cut the pieces of candy from the end. Cut a 1/2-inch piece, give the roll a half turn, cut again and continue until you&#39;ve used the whole roll. Be careful the candy does not touch the other pieces or it will stick together. That?s Berlingot. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Prosecco]&quot; 68508,&quot;Frozen Ravioli Pierogies One 20-ounce package frozen cheese ravioli 4 tablespoons butter, plus 2 tablespoons more if needed 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1 pound Italian sausage, crumbled<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2 large onions, cut in half and sliced<br> One 16-ounce tub sour cream<br> 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil.

Set aside. Grate the tofu on the large holes of a box grater onto a baking sheet or large flat plate. Evenly spread out the grated tofu and top with 2 layers of paper towels. Use your hands to firmly press the paper towels into the tofu until they&#39;re completed soaked with liquid. Repeat the pressing with another 2 layers of paper towels until the tofu is dry and looks like shredded chicken. Add the pressed tofu to the medium bowl and gently fold to combine. Sprinkle in the flour and gently fold it in. In a 10- to 12-inch high-sided skillet, heat 1/2 inch of the oil to 350 degrees F. Line another baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. While the oil heats, use a 2-tablespoon ice cream scoop to portion out 20 tofu nuggets onto the first baking sheet. Using an offset spatula, slightly flatten each portion into the shape of a 1/2-inch-thick nugget. Carefully add a few tofu nuggets to the hot oil. Don\\u2019t overcrowd the skillet or the oil temperature will drop too much (it shouldn&#39;t drop below 300 degrees F). Fry the nuggets, flipping halfway through, until the nuggets are golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes 30 seconds. Remove to the lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining nuggets, heating the oil back to 350 degrees F between each batch.

Add the chicken and cook, tossing occasionally, until brown. Add the carrots, celery, onions and 1 tablespoon of salt and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the corn and 3 1/2 cups of the chicken stock and simmer. Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter in a separate medium saucepot. Whisk in the flour, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Slowly whisk in the cream and the remaining cup of chicken stock. Cook until the mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cream mixture to the chicken mixture and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the Pie Dough to 1/4 inch thickness on a floured surface. Line the mason jars with the dough: Cut a circle of dough with the jar lid and then place the dough circle on the bottom of the jar. Use small handfuls of dough to build up the sides to the rim.

Drain the beans into a strainer or colander and then they should be shocked by dunking the strainer of beans into a waiting bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process, and will help them retain a bright green color. Drain and set aside in refrigerator until needed. Place the lime in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. The lime will be hot coming from the microwave, so let it cool just enough so you can handle it, before squeezing it. Turn on the blender and through the feed opening, add the rosemary, tarragon, cilantro, stone ground mustard, rice wine vinegar, and fresh ginger, and blend together until a smooth paste has formed. At this point the lime should be cool enough to squeeze. With the power on, add the lime juice through the blender feed-tube, and then very slowly add the oil and water until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside in refrigerator until needed. (When chilled, the dressing should resemble something like mayonnaise.) Reserve some of the dressing to drizzle on the plate later. Then, mix the beans, onion, and tomato with the dressing (adjusting the amount to your preference) and refrigerate for only a couple of hours. (Don&#39;t mix too far ahead, because the salad ingredients will bleed and you will have a very runny dressing). &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 68532,&quot;Nacho Baked Veg with Crispy Black Beans 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled or washed, each cut into 4 to 6 wedges 1/2 head cauliflower, cut into florets 1 large red onion, cut into 8 to 10 wedges 3 tablespoons olive oil (45 milliliters) 2 teaspoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon onion powder Kosher salt One 15-ounce can black beans (540 milliliters), drained and rinsed 1 1/2 to 2 cups grated jalape?o jack cheese or nacho cheese blend 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 1 avocado, diced 3 green onions, thinly sliced Pickled jalape?os Cilantro Prepared salsa Plain Greek yogurt or skyr Lime wedges Hot sauce Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to become tender and are just beginning to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper. Move the potatoes to the far edge of the pan, leaving a space to brown the pork chops. Add the pork chops to the pan and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. As the pork chops cook, give the potatoes an occasional stir so they continue to brown evenly. Place the pork chops on top of the potatoes, shingling them to leave as much room in the pan as possible. Reduce the heat to low and add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the bare area of the pan. Add the olives, capers, garlic and thyme and cook, stirring continuously, until fragrant and golden, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Increase the heat to medium, add the tomatoes and wine and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in the chicken broth. Put the pork chops in the sauce and carefully nestle the potatoes around them. Cook 3 to 5 minutes more until the pork chops register 145 degrees F in the center on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the pork chops from the sauce and transfer to shallow bowls or a serving platter. Taste the sauce and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. If most of the liquid in the pan evaporates while you are cooking the pork, stir in tablespoons of water at a time to get it back to a saucy consistency. If the sauce is a little thin and weak, after you take the chops out, turn the heat up and cook 1 to 2 minutes more to thicken and concentrate the flavors. Stir the parsley into the sauce, remove the thyme sprigs, spoon the sauce over the chops and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM blend]</p><p>&quot; 68542,&quot;Melon Balls with Honeylime Yogurt 1 small ripe cantaloupe 1/2 large ripe honeydew 1 wedge of watermelon 1/2 cup freshly-squeezed orange juice 1 generous tablespoon honey, or to taste Juice of one large lime, about 1 tablespoon, or to taste 2 cups plain yogurt Instructions: Use a melon baller to scoop out balls of flesh from the cantaloupe; place balls in a large bowl.

Gently toss the spinach leaves in extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper. For a special presentation, Chef Boswell likes to spread the vinaigrette dressing (about 1/3 cup) on the bottom of the plate and arrange the grapes in a decorative pattern on top. The grapes can be left whole but, at his award-winning restaurant Stella!, Chef Boswell cuts the ends off of each grape so they are a uniform size and can be stood up on end in a checkerboard or mosaic pattern. The grapes are then garnished with the toasted walnuts and baby spinach leaves or other fresh greens. *To toast walnuts: Place walnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 4 minutes at 350 degrees F. Gently crumble walnuts after they have cooled. Optional: If a softer texture of grape is desired, blanch the grapes in boiling water for 7 seconds, then shock in ice water and peel gently. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 68564,&quot;Oatmeal Crusted Pork Loin 4 tablespoons canola oil 1 (3 to 4-pound) pork loin, boned and trimmed 4 tablespoons paprika Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cloves minced garlic 2 teaspoons chopped thyme leaves 2 teaspoons chopped tarragon leaves 2 teaspoons chopped sage leaves 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs 1 cup oatmeal 1/4 cup melted butter 1/2 cup apricot preserves 2 tablespoons water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large skillet over a medium-high heat, add the oil until smoking hot. Season the pork loin with paprika and salt and pepper, to taste. Add to the hot skillet, turning on all sides until golden brown. Remove from the skillet to a plate and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile in a kitchen blender add all of the chopped fresh herbs, the bread crumbs and the oatmeal and pulse until looks a little like course powder. Add the melted butter and combine until slightly wet. Warm the apricot preserves and water in a small saucepan over low heat until melted together. Spread sparingly over the rested pork loin and then top with the oatmeal and bread crumb mixture. Press it down firmly so it adheres to the pork. Transfer the pork to a small roasting pan and put in the preheated oven to roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and continue to cook until the pork reaches the correct doneness, about 15 minutes. The internal temperature should register 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for at least 10 minutes. Slice and arrange on a serving platter to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68565,&quot;Mussel Mariniere 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 stalk celery, finely diced 4 tablespoons minced parsley 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 dozen mussels, cleaned 6 to 8 ounces fresh fettucine or linguine, preferably spinach Salt and pepper Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta.

You can mold chocolate in almost anything but not all molds are filled the same way. For the techniques demonstrated in this recipe, I used plastic eggs of various sizes. You can buy the ones filled with Easter candy and, if necessary, cut them in half. Keep in mind that the temperature in your kitchen will affect the speed at which the chocolate sets. Also, if you want to use a silk screen, you&#39;ll need to have it made at a local art store before you begin the process. You can use store-bought candies to decorate your eggs. The children will have fun with that! To make the medallion, I started with a little of the same chocolate plastic that we used to make the flowers in the previous recipe. Use a rolling pin to roll out one color of chocolate plastic using cornstarch to \\flour\\ the work surface. The rolled chocolate should be about 1/8-inch thick. When using a silk screen, it will be easier if you cut the medallion after you have transferred the design to it. Melt the dark chocolate over a double boiler. Hold the silk screen over the rolled out chocolate. Use a plastic scraper with a straight edge. Apply about a teaspoon of chocolate to the scraper and gently pull the chocolate across the design. Carefully lift off the silkscreen. It will dry almost immediately. Use a paring knife Before you begin the next step, you have to decide if you would like to color the chocolate for the egg. If you do, be sure to use powdered food coloring or the chocolate will seize. Add the color slowly and sparingly until you have the desired color. Don&#39;t forget to save some melted chocolate uncolored so you can use it to finish the decoration. Place the medallion design side down inside one of the egg halves. Use a very clean and dry pastry brush to coat the inside of a mold with chocolate. The pastry brush must be clean and dry. Dip the brush in the chocolate so it permeates the bristles and brings them to the temperature of the chocolate. This tempers the brush so the chocolate will not set on the bristles while you are coating the mold. Apply a total of 3 layers of chocolate, allowing each to set almost completely before applying the next layer. These layers will make the molded chocolate thick enough to handle without breaking easily. When each layer is almost set, use a paring knife to scrape the edge of the mold clean. This will make it easier to unmold the egg. Placing the coated mold in the refrigerator will help the chocolate to harden. If the chocolate is properly tempered, you should be able to lift it from the egg mold. Use some melted chocolate to \\glue\\ the 2 halves together. If you place the pieces in the refrigerator first, the egg will set faster, as the cold chocolate will cause the chocolate \\glue\\ to harden and set quickly. Make a cornet and fill it with tempered white chocolate. Use it to draw decorations on the outside of the egg. I added decorating cake gems that resembled pearls to finish my Faberge egg. Tip: It is easier to work with more chocolate than you need. A larger amount will hold its temper longer. You can allow any leftover chocolate to harden. Wrap it well and store at room temperature. You can melt it again for your next project. Work in glass bowls. Then, if needed, you can use the microwave to melt the chocolate. Variation: When I have a really large mold, I like to create the illusion of texture to lighten the overall effect. Marbleizing chocolate is a simple way to do this. Start by drizzling both white and dark chocolate in the bottom of the mold. Dip your clean, dry fingers in the bowl of tempered dark chocolate and use them to spread the chocolate over the drizzles to create a marbled effect. Dipping your fingers in chocolate coats them and adds a thin layer of chocolate to the mold, which makes it easier to create the marble pattern. When the mold is marbleized, use a ladle to add just enough dark chocolate to coat the sides completely. Empty any excess into the bowl of chocolate and invert the mold over the wire rack to drain further. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge of the mold clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate is completely set, you should be able to gently slide the shell out of the mold by pushing on one side. The mold can be placed in the refrigerator to help the chocolate to harden. If you are using a clear plastic mold, you will be able to see the chocolate is ready to be unmolded when it automatically pulls away from the sides of the mold.

Reduce the heat to medium-high, cover, and cook until the cauliflower is soft and fork-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Thoroughly drain, then return the vegetables to the pot and use a potato masher or fork to lightly mash them (they should still be chunky, just more incorporated). Set aside. Peel the potatoes, put them in a bowl, and use the potato masher or fork to mash them (don&#39;t worry if there are still a few small lumps). Set aside. In a medium pan over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Once the oil begins to shimmer, swirl in the turmeric. Add the coriander, red cl powder, and tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes have started to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add 2 tablespoons water and the green cl, and simmer for about 4 minutes, using a spoon or spatula to mash the tomatoes into a chunky sauce as they cook. Add the mashed potatoes, the cauliflower-pea mixture, the salt, and 1/4 cup water. Increase the heat to medium-low and cook until the mixture starts to resemble a thick stew, 5 to 7 minutes. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if it&#39;s looking too dry. Taste and adjust the salt if needed. Stir in the cilantro, turn off the heat, and transfer the bhaji to a bowl. Wipe out the pan. Make the pav: Split each bun in half and butter each side. Warm the pan you used for the bhaji over high heat and toast the buns in the pan, buttered-side down, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Assemble the pav bhaji: Evenly portion the bhaji on each bun half (like an open-faced sandwich) and top each with a tablespoon of diced onion plus a generous squeeze of lime juice. Serve with remaining onion and lime wedges alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 68580,&quot;Sesame and Ginger Beef Sandwiches 1 pound refrigerated pizza dough (fresh, not frozen) 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for greasing 2 tablespoons sesame seeds Kosher salt 2 cups shredded coleslaw mix 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon chili oil 6 ounces deli-sliced roast beef 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon grated peeled ginger 1/2 cup fresh cilantro Instructions: Microwave the pizza dough on 50 percent power to soften, 1 to 2 minutes, then let rest 5 minutes.

After brushing, run an oiled towel over the grates to pick up any loosened crud or soot. Drizzle each fig half with vinegar and fill each fig center with goat cheese. Sprinkle a couple flakes of crushed red pepper, if using, on top of the goat cheese and wrap each fig with a slice of prosciutto. Paint the outside of each fig very lightly with olive oil. Put the figs on a cooler spot of the preheated grill. The idea here is that we want to grill the figs gently to cook the fig all the way through but to still get the char on the outside. Grill the figs on all sides so the prosciutto is starting to become crispy and the fig feels soft when squeezed, about 5 to 6 minutes. While the figs are grilling, in a large bowl, toss the arugula with a little extra-virgin olive oil, some balsamic vinegar and the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Taste, and add salt, if needed. Arrange on individual serving plates or a serving platter and top with the figs. Drizzle a couple of drops of balsamic on each fig and serve. Its figgy delicious! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 68584,&quot;Big Bob Gibson&#39;s Alabama White BBQ Sauce 1 quart mayonnaise 3/4 quart apple cider vinegar 1/2 cup corn syrup 1/4 tablespoon cayenne pepper Prepared horseradish Lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place all ingredients in a very large blender or food processor.

Add the bulgur and quinoa and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer the grains to a fine-mesh strainer and hold under cold water to stop the cooking. Let the grains drain in the strainer for 15 minutes, then spread them out on a thick layer of paper towels to absorb any extra moisture. Meanwhile, coarsely grind the flaxseeds in a spice grinder, just to break them open. Stir together the warm water, agave and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Whisk the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl; add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil and mix together with a stiff rubber spatula. When the dough starts to come together, mix in the cooked grains, ground flaxseeds and sunflower seeds; form the dough into a uniform ball in the center of the bowl. Be sure to scrape and use any dough stuck to the sides. The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on a clean, dry work surface. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface and knead for a couple of minutes, working in just enough flour to make the dough less sticky but still moist to the touch. Flour your hands periodically to prevent sticking. Form the dough into one single ball or divide it into smaller balls. Place the dough ball(s) on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let the dough rest for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the dough can be shaped and cooked as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 68592,&quot;Steamed Clams with Spicy Garlic Bread 2 tablespoons olive oil 8 ounces andouille or smoked sausage, sliced<br> 1 shallot, thinly sliced<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 1 cup dry white wine<br> 1/3 cup coconut milk<br> 1 tablespoon salted butter<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric<br> 1 pound clams, shells scrubbed<br> 1 tablespoon lime juice<br> 3 sprigs lemon thyme or thyme, leaves stripped Spicy Garlic Bread, recipe follows One 12-ounce loaf French bread 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture. Make the dough in a food processor. With the machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. Make the filling. Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve, and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apple with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the apples, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes. Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to get as much liquid as possible. Return the juices to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, toss the apples with the reduced juice and spices. Set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 6 months.) Cut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half of dough into a disc about 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Put the apple filling in the pan and mound it slightly in the center. Brush the top edges of the dough with the egg. Place the second disc of dough over the top. Fold the top layer of dough under the edge of the bottom layer and press the edges together to form a seal. Flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Pierce the top of the dough in several places to allow steam to escape while baking. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. Bake the pie on a baking sheet until the crust is golden, about 50 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving. The pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68598,&quot;Froscato Sunrise 1 1/2 cups orange juice, plus more for blending One 750-milliliter bottle Moscato<br> 1 cup pink lemonade, plus more for blending 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon grenadine<br> 4 maraschino cherries Instructions: Mix together the orange juice with 2 cups Moscato in a large measuring cup or bowl.

(If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator, 3 to 4 hours. or on the countertop for 1 to 2 hours. If time demands, you can thaw on the countertop. If time demands you can thaw on the countertop 1 to 2 hours, but be careful not let it sit too long before you begin working with it, as a cold cake is easier to cut.) Clear a space in the refrigerator large enough for the cake on a cake board. The mousse cake will need several hours to set up. If making the Coconut Simple Syrup now, let cool to room temperature. Make the Coconut Mousse as directed, allowing time for the gelatin-sugar mixture to cool before finishing. Set a revolving cake stand on a clean, dry work surface and place the cake, top-side up, on the stand. Using a serrated knife and holding the blade perfectly horizontal, remove any curve from the top of the cake to level it. While you saw gently with the knife, use your other hand to rotate the stand gradually and bring the cake toward you. Get eye level to the cake as needed to make sure you are holding the knife exactly level. Repeat to split the cake into three or four equal layers. Arrange all the cake layers on the work surface. Using your hands, tap off and brush away excess crumbs. Turn the original bottom layer flat-dark-side, or pan-side, up; reserve this to be the top layer of the assembled cake. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of each layer with an ample amount of the coconut syrup. Line a clean 6-by-3-inch cake pan with plastic wrap, leaving about 3 inches of overhang all around the sides to use later as a handle. Take up the original top of the cake, which you leveled, to be the bottom layer of the assembled cake. Place the first layer of cake, syrup-side up, in the lined pan. Scoop 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the mousse on top of the cake layer and use an offset spatula to level it. Top with the second layer of cake, syrup-side up, and press down lightly to seal and secure. Add another layer of mousse. Repeat with the third layer if making a four-layer cake. Place the reserved top piece, flat-dark-side up, on top. Cover with plastic wrap and carefully transfer the cake to the refrigerator. Let set for at least 3 hours and up to 2 days. To unmold the mousse cake, wrap a hot towel around the pan for 1 minute and gently shake to loosen the cake. Invert the pan onto a cake board on a clean work surface, then gently lift the pan off. If it resists, give a little tug on the plastic-wrap \\handle.\\ When the pan is off, peel the plastic-wrap lining from the cake. Transfer the cake on its board onto the revolving cake stand, with a nonslip pad or damp paper towel underneath. This cake requires only one coat of icing. Using the offset spatula, smear a generous scoop of the icing on one side of the cake. Keeping the spatula in front of you, rotate the cake stand to spread the icing in a smooth coat about 1 inch thick. (It needs to be thick enough to hide the sides of the cake, but not drooping down the sides.) Add more icing as you go, but do NOT back track! The icing will be covered with coconut, so it is not important for it to be perfect; however, you want the cake layers aligned perfectly and the coat of icing to be straight up and down on all sides, as well as crumb free and smooth. As you frost the sides, push the icing up over the top edge of the cake to make sure the coverage is complete, then use this excess to frost the top, using the spatula to pull the icing across the cake toward the center. There should be enough icing from the sides to cover the top, but if necessary, add another small scoop. Using a cupped hand, apply the dried coconut to the sides and top of the cake, pressing gently to help it adhere. Very carefully transfer the cake on the board to a presentation platter. Gather up any excess coconut and press it onto the cake, or reserve for another use. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. Stir 1/2 cup coconut milk into 1/2 cup Simple Syrup. Store tightly sealed in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 68609,&quot;Hotter-Than-Hell Sliders 2 ounces ground chuck Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 ounce fresh sliced jalapeno 1/2 ounce fresh sliced white onion 1 ounce American cheese 1 Hawaiian roll, halved 1 ounce your favorite hot sauce Instructions: Make a loose ball out of the ground chuck.

Zydco Sauce: To make the sauce, combine mayonnaise, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, mixing whole grain, pepper sauce and red pepper flakes in a bowl mixing well; cover and refrigerate. To make the slaw, combine the Napa cabbage, purple cabbage, red onion, fennel and yellow pepper in a bowl and chill. Prepare the slaw dressing by combining the sugar cane vinegar, whole grain mustard and slowly incorporate the extra-virgin olive oil while whisking. Refrigerate the dressing. 15 minutes before serving pour the dressing over the slaw mixture and toss. Add the crumbled blue cheese and toss again evening combining the cheese. Add salt and pepper. Drain off excess liquid and chill the slaw. To make the glaze, combine root beer soda, chili sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, dark brown sugar, molasses, liquid smoke, root beer extract, ginger, garlic powder and onion powder in a heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to approximately 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Glaze should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season the glaze to taste with salt and pepper. Set the glaze aside (it will thicken slightly as it cools). For burgers place ground chuck in a large bowl in a cold refrigerator for 1 hour prior. Add in pepper sauce, green onions, salt and pepper. Handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting it, mix well. Quickly shape beef mixture into 6 round, equally sized patties. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until ready to grill. Brush grill rack with oil and place patties on grill, cover and cook, turning once, until done to preference, 5 to 7 minutes on each side for medium. Just before patties are done brush with root beer glaze. Meanwhile, brush melted butter on top and bottom buns. Position buns; cut size down, on the outer edges of the grill for the last 2 minutes of grilling to toast lightly. When patties are cooked, remove from grill, and keep warm while resting. To assemble burgers, spread a generous amount of the Zydeco sauce over the cut sides of the buns. On each bun bottom, add a burger patty and brush again with root beer glaze. Add a portion of blue cheese Mardi gras slaw.

This is similar to Panettone but I discovered it in Lugano, an Italian part of Switzerland on Lake Lugano. We stayed in Gandria where there are no cars so we took boats everyday and walked wherever we needed to go. We went to a bakery called Munger&#39;s in Lungano and sampled their Kirsch filled Amereti Cookies that have bottoms dipped in chocolate, Rhubarb tart and this Triestine bread, which was $18.00 but worth it! It comes originally from the town of Triest in Switzerland (I believe) and uses candied orange peel and citron peel plus sugared almonds instead of Panettone&#39;s traditional golden raisins. It lasts for days, staying moist and delicious and it&#39;s wonderful toasted as well. We bought one on our honeymoon and noshed on it in our hotel room for almost week, bringing hunks of it down to breakfast in the morning to have with the best milky cafe con leche ever. It even made it back to Chicago for us to snack on while we reminisced about our fabulous trip. To make the Biga: In a mixer with a dough hook, dissolve the yeast with warm water; then add the sugar and let rest 5 minutes. Add the flour and mix on low until smooth. Cover and let rise until it triples in bulk. To make the Dough?1st Stage: In a small cup, dissolve yeast in warm water and let sit 5 minutes. Add it to the biga and mix with the dough hook.

Knead with the dough hook on medium speed, add the remaining sugar, salt, and vanilla extract. Knead 5 more minutes. With the mixer running, add 10 tablespoons butter, one tablespoon at a time. The dough should look smooth and shiny and pull away from the sides of the bowl. Place it on a work surface and schmear it with the remaining tablespoon of butter and add the orange peel and citron and knead by hand until blended. Shape into a ball and place in a covered bowl and let double in bulk. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and divide into 2 balls. Place the chopped almonds on a surface and roll the balls in them to coat well; then roll the balls in powdered sugar to coat heavily. Place each ball in a buttered panettone mold (straight walled paper cake pan). Let rise covered for 1 hour or until it springs back when poked and risen past the rim.

To make the pastry, combine the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in the chunks of cold butter with a pastry blender, a little at a time, until the dough resembles cornmeal. Add the egg yolk and the ice water, and blend for a second just to pull the dough together and moisten. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. To make the caramel sauce: place the sugar and water in a small pot and cook, without stirring, over medium-low heat until the sugar has melted and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the burner and add the cream and wine slowly. It may bubble and spit, so be careful. When the sauce has calmed down, return it to the flame, add the vanilla bean and heat it slowly, until the wine and caramel are smooth and continue to slowly cook until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and cool until thickened. Fill a large bowl with cold water and squeeze in the lemon juice. Peel the apples with a paring knife, cut them in half, and remove the core with a melon baller. Put the apple halves in the lemon-water (this will keep them from going brown). Toss the apples with the flour and cinnamon. Take the dough out of the refrigerator, unwrap the plastic, and cut the ball in half. Rewrap and return 1 of the balls to the refrigerator, until ready for the top crust. Let the dough rest on the counter for 15 minutes so it will be pliable enough to roll out. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin and lay it inside a 10-inch glass pie pan. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slice a couple of the apples at a time using a mandolin or a very sharp knife. The apples need to be thinly sliced so that as the pie bakes, they collapse on top of each other with no air pockets. This makes a dense, meaty apple pie. Cover the bottom of the pastry with a layer of apples, shingling the slices so there are no gaps. Ladle about 2 ounces of the cooled red wine caramel sauce evenly over the apple slices. Repeat the layers, until the pie is slightly overfilled and domed on the top; the apples will shrink down as the pie cooks. Top the apples with pieces of the butter. Now, roll out the other ball of dough just as you did the first. Brush the bottom lip of the pie pastry with a little beaten egg white to form a seal. Place the pastry circle on top of the pie, and using some kitchen scissors, trim off the overhanging excess from around the pie. Crimp the edges of dough together with your fingers to make a tight seal. Cut slits in the top of the pie so steam can escape while baking. Place the pie on a sheet tray and tent it with a piece of aluminum foil, so the crust does not cook faster than the apples. Bake the caramel apple pie for 25 minutes on the middle rack. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar with the freshly grated cinnamon. Remove the foil from the pie and brush the top with the remaining egg white. Sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon sugar and return to the oven. Continue to bake for another 25 minutes, until the pie is golden and bubbling. Let the apple pie rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour to allow the fruit pectin to gel and set; otherwise the pie will fall apart when you cut into it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68646,&quot;French Onion Dip 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 Vidalia onions, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rings 2 large shallots, sliced into -inch-thick rings 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 cups sour cream 1 cup mayonnaise 1 teaspoon celery salt 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Salt and freshly ground pepper Chopped chives, for garnish Potato chips, for serving Instructions: In a large saute pan, heat the butter over medium-high heat.

Scrub the beets and put them on a large piece of aluminum foil; season with salt and pepper, add 3 thyme sprigs, and drizzle with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Bake until the beets are tender, about 1 hour. Set aside. When the beets are cool enough to handle but still warm, slip off their skins, and chop them into large chunks. In a large heavy bottomed pot over medium heat, add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Put in the onion, carrots, garlic, and remaining 3 thyme sprigs and cook until softened and just starting to color, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken stock and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs. Put the chopped beets into a blender and add the cooked vegetables and most of the stock. Blend until smooth, add more stock if the puree is too thick. Add the vinegar and honey; season with salt and pepper. Blend again to incorporate flavors. Borscht can be served hot or cold.

Cut off the core of the escarole, wash it and then place it in a pot with a couple cups of water to steam it. While escarole is steaming, put the meat in a bowl and cover it lightly with a layer of garlic salt, layer of black pepper and 2 layers of cheese. Then, add a layer of breadcrumbs and 1 egg. Mix well. Roll the mixture into 1/2-inch meatballs. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the cooked meatballs from the oven and place them in a brown paper bag with a paper towel. Shake the bag a few times to eliminate excess grease. Drain the steamed escarole and chop it. After chopping the escarole, drain it again. Fill a 16 quart stock pot a little more than halfway with cold water. Add chicken, celery, carrots and salt and pepper to taste. Cook on medium heat for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours, skimming the top of the pot every 15 minutes or so. Be careful not to add too much salt to the soup until it is finished because the escarole, eggs and cheese have salt in them. After cooking, remove the chicken from the broth and let cool. Turn the stove up to high and bring the broth to a boil. Once the broth comes to a boil, add the escarole and the meatballs. Stir until completely mixed. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and add to the soup. Bring soup back to a boil. In a bowl, mix together the eggs and cheese with a wire whisk. Slowly stir the egg/cheese mixture into the boiling soup. Reseason if necessary. Cover the pot and remove from the heat.

F. Coat a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray. Heat the milk in the microwave until steaming, 30 to 45 seconds. Put the cocoa powder in a large bowl; pour the hot milk on top and whisk to combine. Let the cocoa steep, about 5 minutes. Add the egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, the vegetable oil, vanilla and espresso powder to the cocoa mixture; whisk to combine. Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt; whisk to combine. Combine the egg whites and cream of tartar in a separate large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high and beat in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Whisk one-third of the egg white mixture into the batter to lighten. Gently fold in the remaining egg white mixture in 2 batches until fully combined and there are no white streaks remaining. Scrape the batter onto the baking sheet; spread evenly to the edges. Bake until the cake just springs back to the touch and no longer looks wet in the center, 12 to 16 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let the cake cool 10 minutes in the pan, then invert onto the rack and carefully peel off the parchment. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Transfer the cake to a cutting board, cut in half crosswise and lightly wrap each half in plastic wrap. Freeze the cake halves until almost frozen and firm, about 2 hours. In the last 15 to 30 minutes of freezing the cakes, remove the ice cream from the freezer and let soften until spreadable but not melted. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving a 6-inch overhang on the sides. Unwrap the cake halves; place 1 cake half in the bottom of the dish.

Mix the coffee liqueur and espresso in a small bowl, then add to the remaining dough in the mixer along with the chocolate, pulsing until combined. Transfer the chocolate dough to another sheet of parchment paper. Pat each portion of dough into a 10-by-6-inch rectangle and cover with another sheet of parchment paper. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Roll out each portion of dough between the parchment sheets into a 12-by-8-inch rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Peel off the top parchment sheets and carefully invert the lighter dough onto the darker dough. Run a rolling pin over the dough to press it together. Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Roll over the dough a few more times to make it slightly thinner, then peel off the top sheet of parchment paper and trim the dough into an even rectangle. Position the dough with a long side facing you and roll it away from you into a tight spiral, using the parchment paper to help. (The dough should be just soft enough to roll; chill or let stand at room temperature as needed.) Wrap the log with the parchment paper and freeze until firm, at least 1 hour. (The dough will keep in the freezer for up to 2 months.) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice the log of dough into 1/4-inch-thick rounds; place about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with the raw sugar, if desired.
