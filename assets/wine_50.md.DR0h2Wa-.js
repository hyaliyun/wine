There's a dusty note as well, and the richness keeps bringing in more nuances of English Breakfast tea, sweet stone fruits and lightly tropical papaya. Supple, round and luscious, it has excellent length and a clean exit.","designation":"","title":"Upland Estates 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Snipes Mountain)"},{"country":"US","description":"A welcome return to form after the disappointing 2005.

The blend continues as before 54% Merlot, 33% Cab Franc, 7% Petit Verdot, and 6% Malbec, all estate-grown. The wine opens with barrel scents and flavors of tea, tobacco and wood smoke.

Now Merry Edwards has her own bottling, and it's right up there.

Siro Pacenti's 2004 Brunello is not the concentrated blackberry and chocolate fudge bomb of the past. It's still a meaty, layered wine laced with pretty layers of spice, mineral and ash. But instead of black concentration, it now exhibits ruby luminosity and a fresh, menthol finish. We are impressed.","designation":"","title":"Siro Pacenti 2004  Brunello di Montalcino"},{"country":"de","description":"Like the Im Sonnenschein, this wine shows a touch of green on the nose, but there are also some riper notes that bring to mind tangerines.

But there's a great, deep heart of black currants longing to blossom.","designation":"Estate","title":"Chalk Hill 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)"},{"country":"it","description":"This is among our favorite 2004 Brunellos. Winemaker Andrea Cortonesi who once said,  the best irrigation is sweat,  has worked hard to craft this plush, modern and penetrating wine.

It's round and supple and shines simpatico.","designation":"","title":"Uccelliera 2004  Brunello di Montalcino"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a tremendous Syrah, in every sense of the word. It's too young to drink now, although most of the 4,800 bottles produced will be opened too soon.

Better after 2011.","designation":"Mitchell Vineyard","title":"Honig 2005 Mitchell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful Cab, lush, ripe and fat, yet always maintains elegant balance.

A pronounced peppery, black licorice note adds extra length to the finely textured finish. Drink nowC2020.","designation":"Old Vine","title":"Kaesler 2006 Old Vine Shiraz (Barossa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a tremendous Cabernet Sauvignon, but be warned, it's so tannic, it makes your tongue curl. That's what mountain grapes, grown at 2,000 feet with low yields and small berries, do. Such is the core of black currants, however, that aging is not a problem. With its dryness, intensity and overall balance, it should easily negotiate the next decade. Really displays Napa mountain Cab at its best.","designation":"Rattlesnake Hill","title":"Barnett 2006 Rattlesnake Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)"},{"country":"US","description":"The huge, thick tannins are all from the wine's 1,500-foot mountain vineyard, but they're so soft and refined, the wine is instantly drinkable, although it will age for many years.

It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative.

Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon.

It's almost exactly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and smells like beautifully ripe blackberries, boysenberries and cassis. It sets up in the mouth firm and textural, and adds layers of chocolate and baking spices as it winds through the finish.

The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape.

This is a good price, especially compared to what's going on in Napa Valley.","designation":"Landslide Vineyard","title":"Simi 2005 Landslide Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"There is a little Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Syrah (4%) in the blend also. This is a silky, yet muscular  let's say it, masculine style of Merlot. Meaning that the fruit is concentrated with deep blue and black berry and cassis flavors, augmented with lead pencil. Beautiful polish and concentration characterize this wine, yet it's quite approachable.","designation":"","title":"Woodward Canyon 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.","designation":"Greg La Follette Van de Kamp Vineyard","title":"Lookout Ridge 2006 Greg La Follette Van de Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain)"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.","designation":"","title":"Olivier Leflaive 2006  Corton-Charlemagne"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years.","designation":"Les Preuses Grand Cru","title":"La Chablisienne 2006 Les Preuses Grand Cru  (Chablis)"},{"country":"US","description":"This barrel-selection bottling honors the winemaker's father-in-law, and comes from the best lots of Syrah. Sixty percent was whole-cluster fermented, yielding an intense, peppery, spicy and almost laser-like wine with sharp streaks of mint, herb, wild berry and earth. It opens elegantly into a smooth, almost silky finish, adding sweet chocolate to the mix.","designation":"John Lewis","title":"Gramercy 2006 John Lewis Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells young and juvenile, a bit raw. Shows briary aromas of wild berries, thyme, cherries and mocha. A chewy wine, tannic and spicy. Hard now, a bit austere, but beautifully structured, with a thick, currant-infused taste. Needs time.","designation":"St. Eden","title":"BOND 2005 St. Eden Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Big, powerful brush strokes of ripe fruits, spice and rich creaminess paint this wine with vividness. The fruit envelops the mouth, the pears, green plums and ripe apples working with a citrus edge. Impressive, and with a great finishing freshness.","designation":"Les Preuses Grand Cru","title":"William F vre 2006 Les Preuses Grand Cru  (Chablis)"},{"country":"US","description":"A brilliant Pinot Noir, grown organically from the winery's new vineyard in a cool part of the coastal mountains. More tannic and acidic than Pinots from the estate vineyard in Green Valley, it offers lush, deep flavors of cherries, black raspberries, gingersnap cookies and almond biscotti. Just terrific, and will take a few years of bottle age in a cool cellar.","designation":"Mas Cavalls Do?a Margarita Vineyard","title":"Marimar Estate 2006 Mas Cavalls Do?a Margarita Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique.","designation":"Rosella's Vineyard","title":"Zepaltas 2006 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)"},{"country":"fr","description":"The Chateau Grenouilles vineyard, wholly owned by members of the La Chablisienne cooperative, is in the upper part of Grenouilles Grand Cru. As such, this is major Chablis, a wine that needs maybe 10 years' aging. But already, you can discern the richness of this wine, its powerful yellow fruits, honey and toast, dense in texture as well as vivid with acidity.","designation":"Chateau Grenouilles Grand Cru","title":"La Chablisienne 2006 Chateau Grenouilles Grand Cru  (Chablis)"},{"country":"fr","description":"This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.","designation":"Domaine Long-Depaquit Moutonne Grand Cru","title":"Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine Long-Depaquit Moutonne Grand Cru  (Chablis)"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is from a sub-division of the Corton vineyard, at the northern end of the Grand Cru. It shows both depth of flavor and freshness, a ripe wine that brings in delicious, appetizing acidity and spicy toast. It will obviously age, the nuts and secondary flavors still waiting to show, but as a fruitier style it will be ready in a year.","designation":"","title":"Chanson P re et Fils 2006  Corton Vergennes"},{"country":"US","description":"Gigantic, huge. Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.","designation":"Bancroft Ranch Vineyard","title":"Beringer 2005 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Howell Mountain)"},{"country":"US","description":"Gorgeous and delicious, this low-production bottling is a best-of-barrels selection named for Marimar Torres's daughter. It's an exceptional wine that's compelling not only for its vivacity but also its complexity. Offers wave after wave of cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb pie, roasted coconut, red licorice, tangerine zest, sweet vanilla oak and Asian spices through a long finish.","designation":"Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard","title":"Marimar Estate 2005 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power. This serious new Napa Cab is great now, and should develop for many years.","designation":"Exposure","title":"Oakville East 2005 Exposure Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)"},{"country":"US","description":"Although this Cab is quite tannic, it's really good now. Shows impeccable balance in a New World style that oozes black and red currants, dark chocolate, licorice, cedar and plums, with a note of raw, bloody meat. Very high quality, an excellent rendition of western Paso Robles hillside Cabernet. Good through 2015, with proper cellaring.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Justin 2006 Reserve Cabernet (Paso Robles)"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised.

Full-bodied and dry, it's balanced and rich, with complex flavors of currants, minerals, cedar and spice. The tannins are strong, but ultra-refined. Drink this high-quality wine now and through 2015.","designation":"Trilogy","title":"Flora Springs 2005 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.","designation":"Insignia","title":"Joseph Phelps 2005 Insignia Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Voluptuous, lush, a wine of great power. Packed with cedar-inspired flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, currants, cassis, cola, licorice and spice, wrapped into a texture of velvet and silk. Delicious and compelling. Only 126 cases produced.","designation":"Widdoes Vineyard","title":"Lost Canyon 2007 Widdoes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is Woodward Canyon's reserve the best lots of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot create this very limited wine. It is built to age, and reflects the tight and muscular style that Rick Small has developed over the years. There is a strong mineral-metal vein running through the black and blue fruits, and some very lively spicy highlights. Tannins are ripe but firm, and this is a wine that will benefit from further cellaring.","designation":"Estate Red Wine","title":"Woodward Canyon 2006 Estate Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors.

Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years.","designation":"","title":"Harlan Estate 2005 Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Black in color, glyceriney. Massive, deep, tremendous. Some will find it overpowering in New World extraction, but it's a real beauty in that style. Explodes in black currants, chocolate and new oak, almost overripe, with suggestions of raisins. Almost dessert-like, but stays dry and elegant. Defines modern Napa Valley cult Cabernet Sauvignon.","designation":"Estate","title":"Staglin 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)"},{"country":"hu","description":"This famed Hungarian dessert wine never disappoints. An elegant nose of honey, apricot, butterscotch and spice is followed by a luxuriant, mouth-coating wave of satiny honey and apricot flavors, balanced by citrusy acidity. Complex, perfectly poised, it's a wine with both pedigree and charm delicious when sipped alone or paired with a mild Roquefort or fruit.","designation":"Essencia","title":"Royal Tokaji 2000 Essencia  (Tokaji)"},{"country":"fr","description":"What makes a great Chablis grand cru? It's the intensity of flavor, which can be found in this wine.

Drink now through 2015.","designation":"Melbury","title":"BOND 2005 Melbury Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"fr","description":"The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness. At the end, acidity lifts the wine, finishing with freshness as well as intensity.","designation":"","title":"Domaine Leflaive 2006  Batard-Montrachet"},{"country":"US","description":"Price be damned, this is an authentically gorgeous, important Cabernet Sauvignon. It calls to mind the amazing 2001, with its huge, perfect tannins and acids and artistic appliqu  of new oak. But the star of the show surely is the fruit. Mounds of ripe blackberries and cherries pile up, veering into currants and cassis and something wild and decadently animal, like charred meat. Fabulous now despite the firm tannins, and should evolve for many years.","designation":"Backus","title":"Joseph Phelps 2005 Backus Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty.

Should age.","designation":"The Maiden","title":"Harlan Estate 2005 The Maiden Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This year's Matriarch is very similar to Harlan Estate in structure, and in some ways, a superior wine, or at least more delicious now. Shows the most beautiful black currant, cedar, blueberry pie and Asian spice flavors. What makes the structure so gorgeous are the firm tannins. Ultimately, it's a refined, exquisite red wine. Hard to imagine a better one for drinking over the next decade, and just shows that price sometimes has no relationship to quality.","designation":"The Matriarch","title":"BOND 2005 The Matriarch Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"es","description":"Murky and dusty, with additional nutty, dirty aromas.

Blackberries rule here, but there is a strong menthol/mint streak as well, which leaves the palate feeling as if a curiously strong breath mint has recently passed through.

It has a touch of leafiness on the nose but also dark fruit, shoe polish and style. Gets better as it airs out, and thus the raspberry and plum flavors take on a forward, easygoing likability.

Drink now through 2010.","designation":"Finca El Puig","title":"Fuentes 2004 Finca El Puig Red (Priorat)"},{"country":"es","description":"Heavily roasted and loaded up with coffee, mocha and other huge oak-based aromas. Frankly, there's so much new-barrel influence on this youngster that it's hard to assess. Once you're past the oak, there's deep fruit in the blackberry and cassis realm, and then fierce tannins that dry out the palate. Needs time.","designation":"Mas La Plana","title":"Torres 2005 Mas La Plana Cabernet Sauvignon (Pened s)"},{"country":"US","description":"Made for the long haul, this 100% Cab was fermented in 100% new French oak. Right now, it's a hard, tannic wine, with little to relieve the astringency. The dominant flavors are of primary fruit black currants and sweet, charred wood. The score reflects the current drinkability, but it's a wine that could improve dramatically over the years.","designation":"Leonardini Vineyard","title":"Whitehall Lane 2005 Leonardini Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)"},{"country":"US","description":"Light and spicy, this berry-flavored young wine has lovely aromas that could pass for Pinot Noir.

Some heat in the finish from the almost-15% alcohol.","designation":"Scorched Earth Vineyard","title":"Sineann 2007 Scorched Earth Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (OR))"},{"country":"es","description":"Aromas of citrus peel, candy and sweet fruit are challenging at first and better as they evolve. There's a pine or fir quality to the wine, which makes it herbal and almost juniper-like. Surrounding that there's cherry, berry and scratchy tannins.

There's plenty of acid rarely an issue in Oregon but not much depth. It's got fruit and malted chocolate, and the finish lasts a bit longer than you might expect from the light fruit.","designation":"Shaw Mountain Vineyard","title":"Siduri 2006 Shaw Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Kudos to Siduri for offering a serious Oregon Pinot Noir at alcohol levels (13%) reminiscent of Burgundy. It's a welcome tilt for the state that once was tagged as the new world's Burgundian hope, but which has sometimes seemed more like a California wannabe.

The mouthfeel is raw, but firm.","designation":"Vigna Rionde","title":"Roagna 2004 Vigna Rionde  (Barolo)"},{"country":"it","description":"This vintage of Barbaresco from the excellent Paj  cru is very focused on wild strawberries, red currant and cassis but behind the fruit you will find white mineral, ash and smoke.

The wine is ready to drink and would pair with risotto and white truffles.","designation":"Paj ","title":"Roagna 2000 Paj   (Barbaresco)"},{"country":"pt","description":"Herbal, almost medicinal aromas set a complex scene for this densely structured wine. The flavors throughout, while rich, are also severe, a wrinkle on the otherwise ripe fa?ade. That certainly suggests aging, and the dry tannins support this.

The palate is still lively and pithy, with mango, nectarine, apricot and apple flavors.

With this vintage, the team from Chateau Chasse-Spleen has taken charge, and it shows in the structured density of the tannins, maybe edged with austerity, but also based upon rich, black fruits and a mouthful of vivid acidity.","designation":"","title":"Chateau de Camensac 2006  Haut-M doc"},{"country":"de","description":"Plump, mouthfilling and sweet, this is an easy-to-appreciate auslese loaded with fruit-driven flavor. Honeyed apples and pear lead the way, garnished by touches of stone fruit, orange marmalade and hints of slaty minerality.

This 100% varietal Syrah is herbaceous and aromatic, with rich scents that mix the purple fruits with intimations of herb, chocolate and cracker.

Pure, focused and expressive, it is both tightly defined and bursting with bright, spicy red and black fruit. What is given away in terms of breadth (from a lack of blending grapes) is gained in terms of depth; this really shows the varietal character (in Washington) as well as the character (rock, streaks of iron) of the Red Mountain AVA.
