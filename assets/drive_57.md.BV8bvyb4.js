That likely is due to the long hangtime of the Santa Rita Hills.

The neck of the bottle is lined with purple sediment that is almost psychedelic it's so intense.

It is joined by notions of barley-sugar and candied apricot. There is a more tart notion of passion fruit, too, as well as a guiding, lightning flash of welcome acidity that brings a punch of citrus zest. This TBA is like a very potent flavor bomb that not only delivers luscious sweetness but also a counterpoint of acidic thrill. Needless to say, this simply lingers and lasts. Nectar indeed.","designation":"Nouvelle Vague Nr. 6 Grande Cuv√©e Trockenbeerenauslese"},{"country":"morocco","description":"Aromas of peach, green apple and freesia yield to flavors of apricot, peach, orange zest and rose petal.

A slightly soft body and flavors of green herbs, melon and white pepper finish well.","designation":"Kila"},{"country":"us","description":"Juicy blackberry and boysenberry flavors fill out this deeply colored, bold-tasting, full-bodied but not oaky wine. More fruit nuances and concentration develop with each sip, and the richly tannic texture coats the sides of the mouth, propelling the ripe fruit through the finish. It's a great way to enjoy this Bordeaux grape variety bottled on its own instead of in a blend, as usual.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"This is buttery to a fault, with the overpowering aroma of microwave popcorn.

Drink now for its bold, decadent style.","designation":"Saulheimer Kalkstein Trocken"},{"country":"at","description":"A warm but fresh green and yellow pear peel scent on the nose gains even more currency on the palate of this wine. The midpalate exudes a savory, yeasty, textural element that provides structure and interest, yet the finish is very fresh.","designation":"Von Stokstal"},{"country":"us","description":"Though less expensive than the Artisan series releases from Foundry, the Alla Prima seems better balanced.

There is something of the Meursault richness here, in the full white fruit flavors, but this is also a wine that needs to age.","designation":"Les Tessons"},{"country":"au","description":"Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate.

Only 25 cases made.","designation":"Son Negre"},{"country":"us","description":"A citrus-rind aroma takes on an earthy bee-pollen tone on the nose.

Typical notes of plum and berry support a steady palate.","designation":"Selection"},{"country":"us","description":"This opens with pretty cherry fruit flavors, underscored with a touch of mineral and mocha. But there it ends, feeling one dimensional and fading fast in the finish. Three bottles tasted with similar results.","designation":"Founders' Selection"},{"country":"cl","description":"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc dessert bottling is fermented in new French oak, and is aged one year on lees. Rich honey, peach and nectarine fruit could have rendered this wine too sweet and sloppy; instead, its light, gravelly texture keeps it from being too cloying. Honey, mustard grains and light talc on the nose, and a nutty, cr√®me brulee-like finish add elegance where, again, candy could otherwise have reigned.","designation":"Edicion Limitada Golden Harvest"},{"country":"us","description":"Smoky in dark clove and black pepper, this is a smooth, bright Zinfandel from head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in the 19th century.

Light and even melon and pear flavors with herb accents grace the paalte and the fairly extended finish shows an attractive, slight spiciness.","designation":"Le Lune"},{"country":"us","description":"A bit of skin contact gives this Viognier some extra character and texture. Quite aromatic on the nose, peach and pineapple juice aromas are shot through with pink peppercorns and grapefruit spray. The rich palate shows good acidic verve, however it feels slightly hot.

In the end, fruit tones prevail and linger on a moderate finish.","designation":"Cellar Select"},{"country":"us","description":"The first sniffs show plenty of toasty oak, with brambly, tart red fruits and a bit of stem in the tannins.
