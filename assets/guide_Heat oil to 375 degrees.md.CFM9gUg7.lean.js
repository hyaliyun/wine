Cut the beef into large 6-inch sections. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in an extra large skillet on high heat. Do not let the oil smoke. Add the seasoned portions of beef. Brown all sides until a nice crust forms on all pieces, about 10 minutes. Remove from the skillet and let rest for 10 minutes. Peel the shallots and carrots. Cut the carrots and celery into quartered sections. Cut the shallots into wedges. Pour the wine in a large saucepan. Add half the thyme, rosemary and bay leaves with the wine. Reduce the wine by half at a low simmer, about 30 minutes. Heat a deep cast-iron pot or Dutch oven on medium-high. Add enough oil to cover the bottom. Add the shallots to the bottom of the pan and saute, stirring constantly, until translucent, for about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, garlic, and remaining thyme, rosemary and bay leaves. Add a dash of salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are slightly soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Place the beef on top of the vegetables. Pour in the reduced wine and herb mixture and add the beef broth and veal demi-glace. Throw in a dash of salt and pepper. Stir the ingredients and cover. Simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.

Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork and microwave on high for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating each potato a few times. The potatoes are done once a toothpick or skewer easily pierces the flesh. Allow the potatoes to cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, lay the bacon in a large nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat, turning once, until golden and crispy, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain (reserve the drippings in the skillet), then finely chop. Return the skillet with the bacon drippings to medium heat and stir in the half-and-half, a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is hot and steaming; remove from the heat. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a lengthwise slit in the center of each potato. Carefully remove enough flesh to leave about a 1/2-inch-thick wall around the inside. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the potato flesh for another use, then add the remaining flesh to a mixing bowl along with the half-and-half mixture, scallion whites, half of the bacon, a large pinch of salt and 2 1/2 cups of the Parmesan. Mash with a potato masher until mostly smooth. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Put the potato-skin shells on a baking sheet. Divide the mashed potato mixture evenly among the skins. Make a large well in each potato deep enough to hold an egg and crack an egg into the well. Bake the potatoes until the eggs are just starting to set, about 10 minutes. Remove the potatoes and cover the eggs with the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Switch the oven to broil and broil, checking frequently, until the eggs no longer wiggle when you shake the baking sheet, 3 to 5 minutes. To serve, top each potato with the scallion greens and remaining bacon and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22522,&quot;Scott Elley&#39;s Sloppy Joes 35 pounds meatloaf mix (equal amounts of ground beef, ground veal and ground pork) 1 to 1-1/2 cups Worcestershire Sauce<br> 6 large Spanish onions, coarsely chopped 6 red peppers, coarsely chopped 6 yellow peppers, coarsely chopped 6 orange peppers, coarsely chopped 6 green peppers, coarsely chopped Salt 2 tablespoons dried oregano 4 tablespoons granulated garlic 1 gallon barbeque sauce, homemade or store bought 2 tablespoons olive oil 36 sweet Italian pork sausages, casings removed 90-100 fresh hamburger buns or rolls, for serving Instructions: Divide the meatloaf mix between 2 large commercial-size pots and brown the meat for 3-5 minutes under a high flame.

Rinse, then spread each shrimp wide open, leaving the shell on. Sprinkle with salt and the freshly ground black pepper. Set aside for 1/2 hour. In a large, heavy pan, with a tight-fitting lid - preferably a large wok - heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the chicken thighs well with salt and pepper, then add them to the hot oil, skin-side down. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the skin just begins to brown. Add the chorizo slices, and toss them with the chicken. Cook for 1 minute. Add the shallots, garlic and string beans. Mix well. Add the rice and half of the parsley, stirring to coat the rice thoroughly with oil. Add the chicken stock, saffron and paprika. Stir well.

To make the Dough: In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter until soft and smooth. Add the sugar and continue mixing until well blended. Add the vanilla and mix until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, stir together the cocoa powder, cornstarch and flour. With the mixer running at low speed, add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and blend just until combined. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours or overnight. On a floured work surface, using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick, or as thin as you can possibly get it. Use flour-dipped cookie cutters to cut out 1 1/2 inch diameter circles and place them on an ungreased sheet pan, leaving 1-inch between the cookies. You can re-roll the scraps. To make them look more like store bought, prick the disks with a fork a little. Bake until crisp, 12 to 14 minutes, then let cool on the pan To make the Marshmallows: Combine the 1/4 cup water, the corn syrup, and the sugar in a saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil and cook to \\soft-ball\\ stage, or about 235 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a standing mixer fitted with a whisk, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Sprinkle the gelatin over the 2 tablespoons water and let dissolve. When the syrup reaches 235 degrees F, remove it from the heat, add the gelatin, and mix. Pour the syrup into the whipped egg whites. Add the vanilla and continue whipping until stiff. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a round tip. Pipe a \\kiss\\ of marshmallow onto half of the cookies, and top with the rest to make sandwiches. Let set at room temperature for 2 hours. To make the Chocolate Coating: Melt the 2 ingredients together in the top of a double boiler or a bowl set over barely simmering water, stirring occasionally. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. One at a time, gently drop the marshmallow-filled cookies into the hot chocolate. Lift out with a fork and let the excess chocolate drip back into the bowl. Place on the cookie sheet and let set at room temperature until the coating is firm, about 1 to 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22529,&quot;Striped Bass in Salt Dome 1 striped bass, 5 to 6 pounds, gills removed, fins trimmed 4 egg whites 1/2 cup water 2 (3 pound) boxes of kosher salt 1 handful parsley 1 fennel bulb, (with stem) quartered Several sprigs thyme 1 lemon, sliced thin 1/2 orange, sliced thin Olive oil Instructions: Heat oven to 450 degrees. Cover the bottom of a baking sheet large enough to hold the fish with parchment paper. Rinse fish inside and out with cold water and drain. Dry with paper towels. Stuff body cavity with herbs and citrus, saving a few lemon slices for garnish. Set aside. Pour 1 box of salt into a large bowl, add egg whites and water, then the second box of salt. Use your hands to work mixture to a mortar-like consistency. Lay down a 1/2-inch thick bed for the fish to lay on with a 1-inch clearance on all sides. Lay the fish on this bed and pile the remainder of the salt mortar on top. Work into a smooth dome completely encasing the fish. (Don&#39;t worry if the head or tail poke out a little.) Cook approximately 35 minutes. Check for doneness by pushing the probe of an instant read thermometer through the salt into the fish. When temperature reaches 130 degrees, remove from oven, and rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Open the fish at the table by hitting the dome several times with a small hammer and lifting off the slabs of salt. Brush away any stray salt. Gently pull out dorsal (back) fin. Using a fish knife or serrated pie server, make a single incision all the way down the back of the fish and around the gill plate. Then lift the skin off working from the head to the tail. Remove meat from top side of fish, going down one side of the spine then the other. Grasp the tail and remove the skeleton, (it should come up intact). The meat revealed below will slide right off the skin. Sprinkle meat with a little virgin oil and lemon juice.

Toss the potatoes with the oil, lemon juice and pepper in a medium bowl; season liberally with salt. Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until tender and the skins start to loosen from the insides, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the butter, sour cream and lemon zest with a wooden spoon. Season with some salt and pepper. When the potatoes are done, use a fork slice to slice halfway through the potatoes lengthwise, and push the ends together. This will make the insides fluff up. Top each potato with some sour cream butter and a 1/2 teaspoon or so of caviar and chives, and serve hot.

Place a cup of the chopped almonds with 1/4 cup corn syrup in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over low heat to liquify the corn syrup. You only want to heat the mixture until the corn syrup is thin enough to coat the nuts evenly; this will take 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Using a large slotted spoon, allow the excess corn syrup to drain as you scoop the coated nuts onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Repeat method with the pistachio and the hazelnuts. Be sure to spread them in an even layer so they will roast evenly in the oven. Bake until they are evenly caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. To test for doneness, you can also break a nut in half and check to see if it is light brown on the inside. Keep an eye on the nuts because the sugar will burn very soon after it caramelizes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place on a wire rack. When the nuts are completely cooled, break apart any that are clustered together. Fill a cornet half full with the tempered bittersweet chocolate. Pipe a chocolate circle 3 1/2 inches in diameter onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. If you do not have a cornet, you can use a spoon; drop a spoonful of the chocolate onto the parchment paper and spread it into a 3 1/2-inch diameter circle with the back of the spoon. In either case, keep the thickness of the circle as even as possible. Make about 5 circles. Then, create your own design as you top each circle with the nuts and fruits. Work quickly, or the chocolate will set before you&#39;ve accomplished this. If the nuts and fruit do not stick to the chocolate, lightly dip them in the bowl of tempered chocolate and \\glue\\ them to the top of the disk. When you finish these, repeat the process until you have used all of the tempered chocolate, nuts, and fruit. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 22534,&quot;Chicken Coconut Soup 2 1/2 cups desiccated coconut 3 cups milk 4 stalks fresh lemongrass 4 cups chicken stock 15 quarter-sized slices fresh galanga, or fresh gingerroot 10 whole black peppercorns, crushed 3 serrano chiles, thinly sliced 12 fresh lime leaves (or scant 1/4 teaspoon grated lime zest) 2 cups coconut milk 1 whole chicken breast, boneless, skinless, cut into bite-size pieces 1 cup canned straw mushrooms, drained well 1/2 cup julienned snow peas 1/2 cup julienned carrots 2 tablespoons fish sauce Juice of 2 limes Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: Combine the coconut with the milk in a heavy saucepan.

Butter and flour 2 (8-inch) round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment well too. Pulse the pineapple in a food processor fitted with a metal blade until it is finely chopped. Put the eggs in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat the eggs for 10 seconds. Add the oil, 1/4 cup melted butter, vanilla, carrots, chopped pineapple and grated fresh ginger and mix until combined. Whisk together the flour, sugars, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt in a bowl until combined. Add the wet ingredients and beat on low speed just until combined. Remove and fold in the crystallized ginger and pecans. Divide the batter between the 2 pans. Bake until the tops are a very golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 40 to 55 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then invert them onto a wire rack and let them cool completely. Remove the parchment from the bottoms of each cake. Cool completely before frosting. In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, bring the water, corn syrup, 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar and vanilla bean to 246 degrees F. Before adding the syrup to the egg whites below, carefully remove the vanilla bean. In the meantime, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes. Still whisking, sprinkle in the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and continue to whisk until the whites hold very soft peaks, about 2 minutes. While mixing on slow speed, carefully drizzle in the hot syrup. Turn the mixer to high and whisk until thick, fluffy and just warm, about 7 minutes. Turn the mixer to low and whisk in the reserved vanilla seeds. Scrape the fluff into a bowl. Wash the bowl and whisk and return them to the machine. Combine the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of the mixer and mix until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low until combined. Increase the speed and whip until light and fluffy. Add about 2 cups of Fluff and the vanilla and whip until combined. Refrigerate for 15 minutes if too soft to use as frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22540,&quot;Stuffed Eggplant Parmesan 2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound each) 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 medium yellow onion, chopped<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped<br> 1 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 4 ounces)<br> 1 1/3 cups shredded low moisture mozzarella (about 6 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Halve each eggplant lengthwise. Leaving a 1/2-inch border, score the eggplant flesh into 1/2-inch pieces. Scoop out the eggplant cubes with a spoon to create a boat out of the shell. Place the eggplant cubes on a rimmed baking sheet, breaking the large pieces apart with your hands, and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and black pepper and set aside. Brush the inside of the eggplant shells with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Place in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Bake the eggplant shells and cubes, rotating the baking sheet and dish halfway through, until tender, about 20 minutes for the cubes and 30 minutes for the shells. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the red pepper flakes and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until a deep brick red, about 2 minutes. Break up the tomatoes with your hands and add to the skillet along with their juices. Swirl 1/4 cup water around the tomato can and add the liquid to the sauce. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of the dried oregano and the basil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Toss together the panko, parsley, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano in a medium bowl. Season with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss to combine. Set aside. Preheat the oven to broil. Combine the cooked eggplant cubes, 2 cups of the sauce, the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan, 1 cup of the mozzarella and 1/2 cup of the panko mixture in a large bowl. Spoon the eggplant mixture into the 4 shells and top with the remaining 1/3 cup mozzarella and the remaining panko mixture. Broil until the top is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, watching carefully. Serve the remaining sauce alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 22541,&quot;Chocolate-Peanut Brittle Cupcakes 3 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder 3 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/4 cups buttermilk 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter 1/4 cup butterscotch chips 1 cup heavy cream 2 10-ounce bags peanut butter chips Instructions: Make the cupcakes: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F using the convection setting, if available. Line two 12-cup muffin pans with paper liners. Put the butter, cocoa powder and 3/4 cup water in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and microwave until the butter melts, about 2 minutes. Whisk to combine, then whisk in the brown sugar. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the warm cocoa mixture. In another bowl, beat the buttermilk, eggs and vanilla; stir into the batter until just combined but don&#39;t overmix. Divide the batter among the prepared cups, filling each three-quarters of the way. Bake until the cupcakes are slightly domed and spring back when lightly pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pans 10 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Make the brittle: Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Place the granulated sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring to a boil and cook, swirling the pan but not stirring, until it turns amber. Remove from the heat; stir in the peanut butter and butterscotch chips until smooth. Immediately pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, smooth into a thin layer with a spatula and let cool. Break the brittle into pieces, place in a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin. Make the frosting: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat, add the peanut butter chips and let stand about 5 minutes. Whisk until smooth.

Mix well then add a little more water, if necessary, to make a smooth, creamy glaze. Cover the glaze directly with plastic wrap and reserve. (For tips on making flavored glazes see the Cook&#39;s Note below.) To make doughnuts: Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium-heat. When the milk reaches a simmer pour it into a mixing bowl and allow it to cool.<br> Meanwhile, measure 1/4 cup of lukewarm water into a small bowl. Sprinkle the yeast into the water then let the mixture stand until the yeast dissolves, about 7 minutes. Stir the yeast mixture into the milk along with 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Mix in 1 1/2 cups of the flour (by hand or with an electric mixer) then cover the dough starter with a clean towel and set it aside to rise and rest in a warm place for 1 hour. When the dough has relaxed, cream the butter with the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Beat the butter mixture into the dough a little at a time. Mix in the egg and salt then mix in the remaining 3 cups flour. Work the dough until it is smooth then place it in a well-greased bowl. Cover again with a clean towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled in bulk, at least one hour.<br> Turn the dough out onto floured board and roll it out about 1/2-inch thick. Using a floured doughnut cutter, cut out the doughnuts. Transfer the doughnuts to a clean floured board or baking sheet. Cover once again with a clean towel, and set aside to rise until doubled. Heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 375 degrees F. Working in batches of 2 or 3, fry the doughnuts until they float. Once they bob to the surface of the oil, carefully flip them over. Continue cooking, turning as necessary, until the doughnuts are uniformly golden-brown.<br> Transfer the cooked doughnuts to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. While the doughnuts are still warm, dip 1 side of each into the glaze then set aside to cool until the glaze firms. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22545,&quot;Hot Chocolate 6 cups whole milk* Enriched Chocolate Sauce, recipe follows Rum to taste, optional Whipped cream, optional 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate shavings or small pieces 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 4 ounces semisweet chocolate 2 teaspoons dark rum 1/8 teaspoon grated orange zest Instructions: Heat the milk (or a mixture of cream and milk for a richer result) until it simmers and whisk it into the chocolate.

Set to pressure cook on high for 35 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> After the pressure cook cycle is complete, turn off the heat and let the steam release naturally for 25 minutes. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for steam release and allow any residual steam to air out. Be careful of any remaining steam and unlock and remove the lid. Carefully use the rack handle to lift out the cheesecake and set it over a cooling rack. Remove the foil from around the pan, then use paper towels to blot off any excess liquid from the top and sides of the cheesecake. Use a small offset spatula or the tip of a paring knife to loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan. Allow to sit at room temperature until mostly cooled, about 1 hour. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Remove the plastic wrap from the cheesecake and use a small offset spatula or the tip of a paring knife to again loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan. Remove the outer ring from the pan and set the cheesecake aside. Bring 3 cups water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Set a medium heatproof bowl over the top, then add the chocolate and let melt, stirring occasionally, until completely melted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a liquid measuring cup and let cool, 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pulse the remaining 4 cookies in a food processor until finely ground. Set aside until ready to use. Set the chilled cheesecake on a serving plate or cake stand and pour the melted chocolate on top. Spread evenly with an offset spatula, allowing some of the excess to drip down the sides. Let the chocolate set for 5 minutes, then sprinkle the cookie crumbs in a crescent moon shape over the top of the cake (it&#39;s okay if some of the crumbs land on the platter). Let the chocolate set at room temperature, 1 hour, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22561,&quot;Boot Tracks 1/2 cup salted butter 2/3 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour 6 tablespoons cocoa powder 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder (optional) Confectioners&#39; sugar for dusting Instructions: To Make Ahead: Store in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Dust with additional confectioners&#39; sugar just before serving. Patti Anderson, a professional quilter, had never entered a cooking contest before she took our challenge. This quick, no-fuss, chewy chocolate cookie is made on your waffle iron. No need to haul out the big mixer, you can mix the batter with a small hand mixer or even by hand. Kids love these! Preheat a nonstick (not Belgian) waffle iron. Cream butter and sugar in a medium bowl. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Add flour, cocoa powder, oil and espresso powder (if using). Beat until thoroughly combined. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoonfuls about 1 inch apart onto the preheated ungreased waffle iron. (To avoid burnt fingers, use two spoons, one to scoop and one to scrape dough onto the waffle iron.) Close and cook until the cookies are puffed and cooked through, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Waffle irons vary, so watch closely and don&#39;t let the cookies get too dark. Transfer to a wire rack to cool until just warm. Dust the cookies with confectioners&#39; sugar while still slightly warm (see Variations). Variations: Instead of confectioners&#39; sugar, drizzle cooled cookies with melted bittersweet and/or white chocolate. Or make a peppermint drizzle: Mix 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, 4 teaspoons water and 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract; add natural green food coloring, if desired.

Crust Preparation: All ingredients should be cold. Combine all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add shortening and butter. Using a pastry blender, cut in the shortening and butter until the mixture resembles course meal. Drop by drop, add the cold water. Mix in with the fingertips, not hands, as the palms will warm the dough. Continue mixing water in until the dough begins to hold together without being sticky but not crumbly. Lightly spray a deep 9-inch pie pan or 8 1/2-inch fluted flan pan. Roll out dough and place in pie pan. allowing the excess pastry to hang over the edge. Chill in the freezer for 10 minutes. Line the pastry shell with parchment and baking beans or beads. Bake the shell for 10 minutes. Remove the paper and beans/beads and return to the oven for 10 more minutes. Cool. Makes pastry for 9-inch single-crust pie. Filling Preparation: Lightly toast 1 cup of shredded coconut in oven, about 7 minutes. Remove and cool. Set aside. Combine egg yolks and sugar. Beat with electric mixer until pale yellow and fluffy. Add cornstarch and melted butter. Blend well and set aside. Heat milk but do not boil. Stir in coconut cream. Gradually add egg and cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly over medium-low heat until filling begins to thicken. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla. Remove filling from heat and let cool. In a mixing bowl, whisk or beat 1 cup of heavy cream on high until it begins to thicken and forms stiff peaks. Set aside. Strain cooled filling through fine mesh sieve to remove lumps. Fold in whipped cream and 1 cup of shredded coconut with pie filling and pour into prepared piecrust. Whisk or beat remaining heavy cream on high until it begins to thicken. Gradually add confectioners&#39; sugar and remaining teaspoon of vanilla. Continue until stiff peaks form. Fold in toasted coconut and spread over top of pie.

Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse 10 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse just until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a floured board and knead quickly into a 5-inch-round flat disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for exactly 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. On a floured board, roll the dough to a rectangle a little larger than 10-by-14 inches. Wrap the dough around your rolling pin and transfer it to the prepared pan. Using a ruler and a small knife, trim the dough to a 10-by-14-inch rectangle. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove the stem of each fig and cut them in quarters through the stem (or in sixths, if the figs are very large.) Place the figs in rows on the dough. Sprinkle with the full 1/2 cup of sugar and dot with the butter. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the pastry is browned and the fruit starts to brown. Rotate the pan once during baking. If the pastry puffs up in one area, cut a little slit with a knife to let the air out. Don&#39;t worry! The juices will burn in the pan but the tart (and the pan!) will be fine! When the tart&#39;s done, loosen it from the pan while it&#39;s still warm and transfer it to a board or clean piece of parchment paper. In a small pan, heat the apricot jelly with 2 tablespoons water and brush the fruit and pastry completely with the mixture. Allow to cool, cut into squares, and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22564,&quot;Sloppy Giuseppes 1 1/2 pounds ground pork sausage meat 1 tablespoon fennel seed 3 tablespoons California chili powder 1 tablespoon New Mexico chili powder Gray salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 tablespoons garlic, minced 1/2 cup red wine 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, roughly pureed or crushed by hand 1 teaspoon dried oregano Chicken broth, beef broth, or water for thinning sauce 6 large soft hamburger buns, split Instructions: In a large bowl, mix together the sausage meat, fennel seed, chili powders, and salt and pepper, to taste.

When it&#39;s at a simmer, stir in the butter, salt and sugar; give it a few minutes until the butter has melted. Place the corn in the pot, cover and cook until tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the corn and cool down enough to handle, and then cut off the kernels with a knife. (Hint: it will be easier to remove the kernels off the cob if still warm.) Mix together the corn, vinegar, cilantro, shallots, garlic and salt and black pepper to taste in a large bowl. For the coulis: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. As that is working, mix together the oil, vinegar, shallots, garlic, peppers, tomatoes, cilantro and some salt and white pepper in a large bowl. Make sure to coat the ingredients evenly with the oil. Place on a baking sheet and roast for about 20 minutes, and then transfer to a blender and mix until smooth. Strain through a fine mesh strainer. Set aside. For the crab cakes: Turn the oven down to 350 degrees F. Mix together the breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, cilantro, egg, onions and peppers in a large bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes while you open and drain the crabmeat. Once the crab is drained of all excess liquid, fold it into the breadcrumb mixture. Form into 8 equal crab cakes. Heat oil to 350 degrees F in a saute pan, and then sear the crab cakes until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to the oven to for 10 minutes. To plate this dish, we use an 8-inch round white plate. First, place a small amount of the corn relish in the center. Place the browned crab cakes directly onto the corn. Finally, spoon a few ounces of the coulis around the corn and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 22571,&quot;Saffron-Pea Basmati Rice Salad 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 medium yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger 6 cardamom pods 1 cinnamon stick 2 cloves 3 1/2 cups water or vegetable stock 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Pinch saffron 2 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained well 3/4 cup frozen peas 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves coarsely chopped 4 scallions, coarsely chopped Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Use a sharp knife to shave off the kernels in rows from the cob. Rotate the corn and cut close enough to the core so that the kernels remain relatively whole, but not so closely that you end up taking fibrous pieces of the cob with you. Repeat with all of the corn. Gather the kernels in a bowl and reserve the cobs. Start the soup: Combine half the olive oil and all the scallions with a generous pinch salt and 1/4 cup water in a large saute pan and cook over medium-low heat until they are translucent and tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. Cook the corn: Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the same saute pan and add all the corn kernels. Season with salt, then stir in the brown sugar and a generous pinch black pepper. Cook over medium heat until the corn becomes tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Finish: Bring the half-and-half and 1 cup water to a gentle simmer in a medium pot over medium heat and add the cobs. Simmer the cobs gently on low heat until they impart their corn flavor to the half-and-half, 12 to 15 minutes. Discard the cobs. Add the Worcestershire and hot sauce and stir to combine. Add the cooked corn and scallions to the pot and simmer on low heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Puree half of the liquid and corn in the blender until smooth and pour back into the rest of the soup. Refrigerate until fully cold, at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Serve: Whisk to blend so some of the remaining corn lands in each bowl as you serve the soup. Taste for seasoning.

Heat butter over medium heat. When it foams, add scallions, and cook until just softened, about 1 minute. Add asparagus and cook until bright green and beginning to soften, about 2 minutes; remove from heat. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, salt, cumin, and pepper in a large bowl until evenly combined. Arrange half of the bread in bottom of prepared dish. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the cheese and half each of jalapenos, cilantro, and asparagus mixture. Pour over half of egg mixture. Repeat layering with remaining bread, another 1/2 cup of the cheese, and remaining chilies, cilantro and asparagus mixture. Pour remaining egg mixture over top. Sprinkle strata with another 1/4 cup of the cheese and push to ensure bread is submerged in egg custard. Cover with plastic wrap, put a plate and a 1-pound weight on top (a large can of tomatoes or rice in a re-sealable plastic bag works well), place in refrigerator for 1 to 12 hours. When ready to bake, heat oven to 325 degrees F and arrange rack in the middle. Let strata sit at room temperature while oven heats, at least 20 minutes. Sprinkle strata with remaining 1/4 cup of the cheese and bake until puffed and edges pull away slightly, about 40 to 45 minutes. Cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.

Add the butter, sugar and salt to the water and stir until the butter is melted, the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is returned to a rolling boil. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. Turn off the heat. Using a heatsafe rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture until it\\u2019s evenly saturated and coming together in a smooth ball. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.<br> Use the spatula to break up the dough into small pieces in the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Using a hand mixer on medium speed, work your way around the bowl incorporating the chunks of dough, egg and vanilla. The mixture will be lumpy at first. After 5 minutes of mixing, it should be evenly hydrated and smooth.<br> Transfer the mixture to a large pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip. Note: A quart container or large cup is very useful to have standing by, since you will be picking up and putting down your pastry bag quite a bit.<br> For the coating: In a baking dish or large bowl, add the sugar, cinnamon and salt. This will be used to coat the churros, so make sure the vessel is large enough that a churro can lay flat in the sugar mixture.<br> To a large heavy-bottomed pot, add 1 1/2 to 2 inches of vegetable oil. Set over medium-high heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F.<br> Reduce the heat to medium and using your pastry bag, pipe four 5-inch-long churros directly into the oil. Use kitchen shears or a paring knife to cut off the dough from the piping bag so that it will fall into the hot oil. (The churros should not feel crowded; the number you can cook at a time will vary depending on your pot size.) Cook until the outsides are dark golden brown and the insides are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. The churros should be a dark golden color before you flip them. Periodically check your thermometer and increase or decrease the heat as needed to keep your oil at 350 degrees F.<br> When the churros are dark golden on both sides, lift them out with tongs and place on a rack to cool slightly and drain excess oil. While they are still warm, toss them in the cinnamon-sugar mixture so they have a nice even coating. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Combine the sugar, butter, cream, vanilla and salt in a large saucepot over high heat. Bring to a boil and then cook until the mixture reaches 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the milk chocolate and white chocolate chips, marshmallow cream and malted milk powder. With the speed set to low, slowly pour in the boiling sugar mixture and paddle until well combined. Pour the fudge into the prepared pan; tap the pan to even out the fudge. Evenly sprinkle the broken malted milk balls over the top of the fudge and lightly press them down into the fudge. Chill the fudge until completely cooled, about 3 hours. Remove the fudge from the pan and cut it into squares. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

Adjust the powdered sugar until the icing is a thick liquid consistency but not too drippy. Add 2 drops of purple food coloring and mix to tint the base. Add 1 to 2 drops of each color and swirl the surface of the icing several times with a skewer or toothpick. Dip a doughnut on one side into the icing, letting the icing drip off for a moment before turning it over and placing it icing-side up on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Continue with the remaining doughnuts. As the food coloring drops become muddled, scoop out the top layer of icing and add new color combinations. You will probably get 2 dips out of each swirl. Sprinkle the doughnuts with edible glitter and let dry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 22580,&quot;Frittata, Fruit Stuffed Crepes, Mango and Arugula Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing 2 cups mushrooms 1/2 cup onions 1/2 cup olives 1/2 cup cheddar cheese 1/2 cup olive oil plus 3 tablespoons Salt and pepper 5 eggs 1/2 cup flour 3/4 cup milk 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons melted butter Fruit of choice, for stuffing 1 mango 1 bunch arugula 1/2 red onion 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar Instructions: Slice the mushrooms, dice the onions, chop the olives and grate the cheese.

For the butter crust: Place the flour, sugar and salt into the well of a food processor and pulse a few times. Add the cold butter cubes and pulse until the mixture is fine and mealy. Add the egg and pulse, then run the food processor until the dough comes together.<br> Turn the dough out onto an 8-inch square tart pan and evenly press into the bottom and sides of the pan. Using a fork, prick the bottom of the crust all over to prevent bubbling. Par-bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until the crust has barely cooked through and is still pale. Remove from the oven and cool completely.<br> For the rhubarb: Trim both ends of each rhubarb stalk so it is 8 inches long. Slice each stalk in half lengthwise, keeping the sliced halves together. Slice each halved stalk into eight 1-inch squares. Slice each square in half to create triangles (128 pieces total). For the almond filling: Place the butter and sugar into a mixing bowl and beat together using an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and continue to mix together. Beat the almond meal, flour and vanilla into the butter mixture until fully incorporated. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and spread evenly using a spatula.<br> To assemble: Starting from the top left corner, take 4 triangles (top pieces) and arrange the pieces together to create a \\frame\\ with a diamond pattern in the center. Repeat until all top triangle pieces have been used, forming 16 \\frames.\\ Take the bottom triangle pieces and arrange them inside each \\frame\\ cut-side up, creating a diamond shape. Repeat until all of the rhubarb pieces have been used and the tart is filled.<br> Brush the top of the tart with a little bit of water and sprinkle with the sugar. Bake the tart for 25 to 30 minutes, until the filling has just cooked through, the top is bubbling and the crust is browned. Allow the tart to cool, about 1 hour.

Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce 1 pound bulk fresh chorizo<br> 1 English cucumber, halved and thinly sliced<br> 1 Fresno cl, seeded and thinly sliced<br> Juice of 1 lime<br> 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced<br> Warm cooked rice, for serving<br> Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Slice 1/2 inch off the bottom of the pineapple to remove the skin and make the bottom flat. Stand the pineapple on a cutting board, holding it from the top, and use a knife to slice away all the skin from the sides. Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise, starting at the crown and going straight down through the core to the bottom. Position one pineapple half core-side down on the cutting board and place a wooden spoon along each long side (this will prevent you from cutting all the way through the pineapple). Make vertical cuts in the pineapple every 1/4 inch, stopping when the knife hits the spoons. Repeat with the remaining pineapple half.<br> Transfer the pineapple halves to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and pour 1 cup of the teriyaki sauce over them. Let sit for 10 minutes, flipping halfway through. Put a small bowl upside down on a work surface and lay one pineapple half over it, core-side down. Gently press the ends of the pineapple half down towards the work surface so the slits open and fan out a bit. Divide the chorizo in half and stuff each slit with some of the chorizo. Repeat with the remaining pineapple half and chorizo.<br> Put the pineapple halves core-side down on the indirect-heat side of the grill and cover the grill. Cook until the chorizo is golden brown and the pineapple halves are dark yellow and tender, 25 to 35 minutes. Brush with 1/4 cup of the teriyaki sauce and transfer to a cutting board.<br> Add the cucumber, cl, lime juice, onion and remaining 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce to a medium bowl and mix to combine.<br> Stand up each pineapple half on a cutting board, hold it firmly by the crown and slice down the length into pieces. Serve over rice with the cucumber salad.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 22590,&quot;Tangerine and Herb Branzino Nonstick cooking spray Two 1 1/4-pound branzino, gutted and scaled (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tangerines or 2 small oranges<br> 4 sprigs fresh oregano, plus 1/2 teaspoon chopped<br> 4 sprigs fresh rosemary<br> 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Use paper towels to pat the whole fish dry. Score the skin of each branzino by making two shallow cuts on a slight diagonal on each side of the fish. Season each branzino inside and out with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Slice 1 tangerine crosswise into 8 rounds (discard any seeds). Halve and squeeze the other tangerine to get 1/4 cup juice. Stuff the cavity of each branzino with the sliced tangerine, oregano sprigs and rosemary sprigs. Close the belly slightly around the filling and tie loosely with a piece of butcher&#39;s string to help hold the filling inside. Heat a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Working one at a time, place the fish in the pan and allow it to sear for 3 minutes, pressing down gently to ensure even browning and crispness. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the first side is golden-brown and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes longer, then flip the fish and repeat on the other side until the fish is golden-brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Transfer the fish to the prepared baking sheet. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan and repeat with the other fish. Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook until the fish are cooked through and the flesh is flaky, about 8 minutes. Remove the fish from the oven and untie and discard the string. Let the fish to rest for 4 minutes. While the fish rests, in a small bowl whisk together the Dijon mustard, chopped oregano, tangerine juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 4 teaspoons olive oil. While the fish is still warm, drizzle the vinaigrette over the fish and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 22591,&quot;Reuben Dog 6 Pastrami Dogs, recipe follows 6 tablespoons salted butter 6 Rye Split Top Hot Dog Buns, recipe follows 6 ounces gruyere, sliced or shredded 3/4 cup 1000 Island Dressing, recipe follows 3 cups Celebration Slaw, recipe follows 3 pounds beef short rib meat or chuck, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (at least 20-percent fat content) Ice, for placing in a bowl 1 1/4 cups ice water 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon powdered dextrose, or 2 teaspoons fine sugar 1 tablespoon ground pickling spice 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons pink salt, such as InstaCure or Prague Powder 1, used for red color, or 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 1/2 tablespoons crushed garlic 1 tablespoon coarsely ground toasted coriander seeds 1 tablespoon coarsely ground toasted black peppercorns 1/4 teaspoon ground juniper berries 2/3 cup nonfat milk powder or textured soy protein 1 tablespoon liquid smoke, use if poaching, not smoking, the dogs 3/4 cup rye flour 3/4 cup warm milk (110 degrees F) 1/4 cup onion, pulverized like an onion smoothie 3 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon instant yeast 3 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour, plus more as needed 3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F) 1 tablespoon caraway seeds, slightly smashed 2 teaspoons kosher salt Nonstick spray 1 egg white 1 cup Garlic Mayo, recipe follows 1/2 cup chopped garlic dill pickles 1/4 cup ketchup 3 tablespoons chili sauce, such as Heinz 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice Salt 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 large egg yolks 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup Garlic Mayo, recipe above 2 tablespoons Creole mustard, such as Zatarain&#39;s 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced fresh scallion 2 teaspoons buttermilk 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Crystal or Frank&#39;s 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 small jalapeno pepper, minced but not deseeded 4 cups store-bought coleslaw mix 1 fresh jalapeno, seeded and julienned Instructions: Preheat a flattop griddle or barbeque grill to medium heat. Cook the Pastrami Dogs on the griddle or grill until the skin becomes very taught and slightly charred, without splitting. If the juice spills out, so does the fun.<br> Spread the salted butter on each side of the Rye Split Top Hot Dog Buns evenly.<br> Split the buns slightly, keeping the bottom intact. Divide the gruyere evenly inside the bun. Try to keep the gruyere on both sides; this is easier to do with slices, but you don&#39;t often find sliced gruyere. And gruyere is so, so good.<br> Grill both sides of the buns until you get that \\grilled cheese\\ look: perfectly golden brown. Put the dogs in the buns. Top each dog with 1 tablespoon of the 1000 Island Dressing and the Celebration Slaw. Be blown away by the awesomeness that is the Reuben Dog. Arrange the meat in a single layer on a plastic-lined sheet tray or in a re-sealable plastic bag. Place the meat in the freezer until the meat is partially but not totally frozen, 30 to 45 minutes. I call this the semifreddo stage.<br> Set a bowl within a larger bowl full of ice. Grind the meat through the largest grinding plate of the meat grinder into the non-ice bowl. Combine the ground meat with the ice water, kosher salt, dextrose, pickling spice, brown sugar and pink salt. Place the meat mixture in a re-sealable plastic bag and cure for 24 to 48 hours.<br> Spread the meat onto a plastic-lined sheet pan. Place the meat in the freezer until the mixture is very stiff (semifreddo again), about 30 minutes.<br> Set a bowl within a larger bowl full of ice. Grind the meat mixture and garlic together using the smallest plate of a meat grinder into the non-ice bowl.<br> Mix the meat in the bowl of a stand mixer with a chilled paddle attachment until the mixture looks like stiff dough, several minutes. The temperature of the meat should be below 35 degrees F at this point.<br> Add the coriander, peppercorns and juniper berries. Add the milk powder and mix, about 2 minutes. Add the liquid smoke if poaching, not smoking, the dogs.<br> Boil a small pot of water to 200 degrees F. Test the meat: create a small meatball wrapped in plastic wrap. Boil the meatball until it reaches 140 degrees F internally, about 10 minutes. Taste the meatball to see if more seasoning is needed. The texture should be firm and springy, like a good hot dog. If the meatball is crumbly, you may need to start over. Sorry.<br> Return the meat to a re-sealable plastic bag and refrigerate until stuffing time or begin stuffing straight away. Stuff the meat into the hog casings, and create links by tying off the casings with the butcher&#39;s twine.<br> Preheat a smoker or charcoal grill with a cover between 180 to 200 degrees F. Smoke the links in the smoker or grill until they reach an internal temperature of 150 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.<br> If smoking on a grill, place the links on one side of the grill and place approximately twenty pieces of charcoal on the other side of the grill. The grill is ready to smoke when the lit charcoal is no longer ablaze. Monitor your grill carefully. If the internal temperature of the grill or smoker gets too high the links will cook too quickly. Alternatively, the links can be poached in 200 degrees F water until the internal temperature of the links are 150 degrees F.<br> Transfer the links to an ice bath and chill until the internal temperature is about 100 degrees F. Combine the rye flour, milk, onion, honey, unsalted butter and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer using the dough hook. Allow to rest, 5 to 10 minutes. The mixture may not bubble much but it should start to swell slightly.<br> Add 2 1/2 cups of the bread flour, the water and caraway seeds. Mix slowly at first and then on medium speed. Add 1/2 cup more of the bread flour and the salt. The dough should come together and have a tacky but not too sticky consistency. Add more of the bread flour, as needed, to get the dough where it just pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue mixing until the dough looks smooth, about 5 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Turn the oven off 3 minutes after reaching the temperature. Spray the inside of a bowl with nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the turned-off oven. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.<br> After the dough rises, remove the bowl from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Punch the dough and transfer to a work space. Separate the dough into 13 pieces, about 3 ounces each, using a bench knife. Use both your hands to roll the dough into tight, uniform balls. Make sure there are no air pockets in the middle of your dough balls.<br> Roll each ball into 7-inch cylinders using both hands and rolling from the middle out. Make sure the cylinders are even in length or your buns will be wonky. Keep whatever dough you are not immediately working with covered loosely with plastic.<br> Line a 15-inch-long, or longer, sheet pan with parchment paper or cover well in nonstick spray. Place each dough cylinder side-by-side up the center of the sheet pan, leaving 1/2-inch space between each one. Cover the pan with plastic and allow to rise until the cylinders are touching, about 15 minutes.<br> Remove the plastic wrap. Combine 1 tablespoon water with the egg white and brush this mixture in an even coat all over the dough. Allow the dough to rise, about 15 minutes.<br> Bake the dough until the buns are nicely golden brown on top and 190 degrees F in the center, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, about 20 minutes total. Allow the buns to rest in the pan, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Transfer the buns in one piece (that&#39;s very important) to a cooling rack to prevent soggy-bottom buns and cool, about 30 minutes.<br> Transfer the buns to a cutting surface. Slice down the center of each tube of dough using a serrated knife (this is the cool part). You will lose half a tube on each end, hence yielding only 12 buns and 2 awesome slices of rye bread that you will eat immediately. The place where the tubes meet is now the center of the bun. They should split naturally but you can use a serrated knife to help them, if you choose.<br> Now you have a beautiful bread wall that you can butter and toast. Wrap the buns in plastic or a re-sealable plastic bag until ready to use. Freeze the buns immediately if you will not be using them the same day. Combine the Garlic Mayo, pickles, ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire, lemon juice and sprinkle with salt. Mix until a homogenous consistency is reached. Combine the lemon juice, mustard, salt, garlic and egg yolks in a blender or food processor. Blend on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil until emulsified. You will hear a \\slapping\\ sound from the blender or food processor when the oil starts to emulsify. Blend the mixture until all of the oil is incorporated; the consistency should be that of a heavy mayonnaise. Use the mayo immediately or refrigerate and keep for up to a month.<br> This recipe can also be made by combining 1 cup store-bought mayo, 1 clove crushed garlic and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Combine the Garlic Mayo, Creole mustard, light brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, scallion, buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, black pepper and jalapenos in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients until incorporated. Set aside. Any of this mixture that you do not used can be stored in the refrigerator, up to 2 weeks.<br> Toss the coleslaw, jalapenos and Garlic Mayo mixture to desired creaminess in a large mixing bowl, about 6 tablespoons Garlic Mayo mixture to 4 cups coleslaw.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until it thickens a bit, about 5 minutes. Let cool. For the thin omelet: Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and coat with a small amount of oil. Use a paper towel to spread it around and wipe up any excess oil. Add a little of the beaten egg and rapidly swirl it around until it coats the bottom. Cook over low heat just until the egg is set, 15 to 30 seconds. It&#39;s done when the edges are dry and the top is just about cooked. Loosen up the edges of the omelet with a spatula, then flip the pan upside down onto a plate. The omelet should flop out like a crepe. Continue with the remaining egg. Roll up the omelets and cut into thin strips. Set aside. For the spring rolls: Remove the crabmeat from the shells. (You can reserve the shells in a freezer bag for making stock). Lay a spring roll wrapper on a work surface so you have a diamond shape. Arrange some scallions, carrot, celery and kimchi in a rectangle in the center of the diamond. Add some of the omelet and spoon over some kimchi. Top with a spoonful of crabmeat and some cilantro. Dip your finger in water and spread a small amount around the edge of the wrapper. Fold in the two sides of the wrapper, then fold the top down and the bottom up to enclose the filling. Cover each roll with damp paper towels as you finish. Heat the canola oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F. Fry the spring rolls, turning them once or twice, until golden and crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve the spring rolls with the dipping sauce. Dissolve the salt in 12 cups (3 liters) cold water. Add the cabbage and refrigerate for 4 hours. Rinse the cabbage thoroughly under cold running water at least 3 times. Pat dry. Bring 1 1/2 cups (375ml) water to a simmer in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk for 3 minutes. Add the sugar and continue to cook, whisking, for 1 minute more. Pulse the red pepper powder, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and onion in a food processor. Add the flour mixture and pulse to combine. Set the kimchi paste aside. Combine the brined cabbage, chives, fish sauce, soy sauce, scallions and cucumbers in a large bowl. Stir in the kimchi paste. Refrigerate until ready to use. You can eat the kimchi fresh, right after making it, or wait 24 hours until it has fermented.

Spray the parchment and ring mold with cooking spray. Melt the praline paste and white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over (but not touching) a saucepan of simmering water, stirring to combine. Fold in the feuilletine. Spread evenly on the bottom of the prepared ring mold. Sprinkle the crushed toffee pieces over the crust. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. For the mousse: Put the milk chocolate in a large bowl. Bloom the gelatin sheets in a bowl of ice water until soft, about 5 minutes. Bring the milk, coffee extract, salt and bloomed gelatin to a boil in a medium saucepan. Puree with an immersion blender until smooth, then strain through a fine mesh sieve over the milk chocolate. Let sit for 5 minutes, then stir with a rubber spatula to combine. Allow to cool to 90 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Meanwhile, whip the cream by hand or with an electric mixer on medium speed until it holds a ribbon on the surface when the whisk is lifted. Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture in 3 additions. Pour over the feuilletine base and smooth evenly with an offset spatula. Allow to set, about 45 minutes, then wrap with plastic wrap and freeze the layered base overnight. For the cremeaux: Put the white chocolate and glucose syrup in a large bowl. Bloom the gelatin sheets in a bowl of ice water until soft, about 5 minutes. Bring the cream, milk and bloomed gelatin to a boil in a large saucepan. Strain through a fine mesh sieve over the white chocolate and glucose. Let sit for 2 minutes, then stir with a rubber spatula to combine. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface so it doesn\\u2019t form a skin and cover the bowl with another piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Flip the frozen layered base over (still in the ring mold), peel off the parchment and place on another parchment-lined baking sheet. Run a hot knife around the edges of the layered base and lift the ring mold to remove. Let sit at room temperature until it can be cut, 15 to 20 minutes and no more than 30 minutes. Test by touching the center with your fingertip. If it leaves a fingerprint, it\\u2019s ready to cut. Cut into 1-by-4-inch inch bars (or whatever size you want).

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, dust with more flour and knead, adding more flour as needed, until smooth but still slightly sticky, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a buttered bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> Make the filling: Mix the mini chocolate chips, granulated sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface, pat and roll out into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the butter over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on one long side. Sprinkle with the chocolate chip mixture and lightly press into the butter. Brush the clean edge with water, then tightly roll up the dough into a log, starting with a long side and rolling toward the clean edge; pinch the seam to seal. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and lightly sprinkle with granulated sugar. Slice the dough log into 12 pieces and arrange cut-side up in the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour, or you can refrigerate overnight, then in the morning let stand at room temperature 2 hours before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Uncover the rolls and bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes in the baking dish.<br> Meanwhile, make the icing: Beat the cream cheese and butter with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla and beat until combined.

So I have come up with a light but tasty alternative that cooks the beef in a fast and furious way - on the wok! It is seasoned with some dried chilli spices and then placed on a bed of baby spinach leaves and dressed with a delicious sweet and tangy dressing. This is one of my favourite fast, delicious healthy suppers and I hope it gets your thumbs up. You can reduce the amount of sugar if you like.

Whisk to blend the ingredients, and then add the very finely chopped cucumber, and cl. Stir, and set aside. For the beef: Heat a wok over high heat, and add the groundnut oil. Add the beef to the hot wok, and stir quickly. Deglaze with the rice wine or sherry, and cook for a few seconds. Add the crushed dried cl flakes, light soy sauce, and white pepper. Cook to your preference: 1 minute longer for well-done or less than a minute for medium. Dress the serving plates with some of the baby spinach leaves, and sliced pak choy. Spoon some of the cl beef into the middle of the platter, and then drizzle generous amounts of the dressing over the top.

With a bench scraper or pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until it forms pea-size chunks. Slowly add the ice water, folding it into the flour until it comes together in a dough; be mindful not to overwork the dough. If the dough is too dry, add another tablespoon of water at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide in half and form into disks. Wrap the two disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the dough rest. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out one of the disks into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured work surface. Roll it up onto the rolling pin and carefully transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the bottom crust into the plate with your fingers. Leave the edges untrimmed. To the bottom crust, add the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, cinnamon, flour, salt, lemon juice and vanilla. Dot with pats of the butter. On the same lightly floured work surface, roll the second disk of dough into a 12-inch round. Lay the top crust over the pie and crimp the edges. Brush the top crust lightly with milk and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Cut vent holes in the center. Bake for 20 minutes; lower the temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for another 45 to 60 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling. Cool completely before serving to allow time for the filling to set up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22736,&quot;Plum Gnocci 24 small Italian prune plums or 6 red or purple plums (or 2 cups chunky apricot or cherry jam) 3/4 cup sugar 1 recipe Gnocci, recipe follows 6 quarts salted water 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter 2 cups coarse plain dry bread crumbs 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 3 large baking potatoes, like Idahos (about 1 3/4 pounds) scrubbed 1 large egg 1 teaspoon salt Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, or as needed Instructions: If using Italian prune plums, halve them lengthwise and remove the pits. Fill each cavity with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and re-form the plums by pressing the halves together. If using larger plums, halve them crosswise, separate the halves neatly, and remove the pits with a small melon baller. Cut them into 1/2-inch dice. In a small sugar bowl, toss the diced plums with 1/4 cup of the sugar. While you prepare the gnocchi dough, bring the water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Flour your hands, the dough, and the work surface. Roll the dough under your palms to form a cylinder 2 inches in diameter and slice it evenly into 24 rounds. Flatten each round in the palm of one hand to a circle about 5 inches in diameter. Place an Italian plum or about 2 tablespoons of the sweetened diced plums (or 2 tablespoons of the jam) in the center of each dough circle. Carefully gather the dough up around the fruit (or jam), enclosing it completely without tearing the dough. Pat the dough between your hands to seal and even the gnocchi. Flour the dough and your hands lightly as you work and place the gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet as you form them. Add as many of the gnocchi as will fit without touching (about half) a few at a time to the boiling water, stirring gently with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. Cook until the dough is tender and the plums are very soft, about 8 minutes after they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, in a heavy, medium-size skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and toast, stirring almost constantly, until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon, and blend thoroughly. Transfer to a large baking dish. Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon, draining them well, and repeat with the remaining gnocchi. Roll the cooked and drained gnocchi while still warm in the bread-crumb mixture until all are well coated. Arrange on a serving plate and sprinkle with any bread crumbs remaining in the baking dish. Serve warm. Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough cold water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook, partially covered, until the potatoes are easily pierced with a skewer but the skins are not split, about 35 minutes. (Alternatively, the potatoes can be baked in a preheated 400-degree oven until tender, about 40 minutes.) Drain the potatoes and let them stand just until cool enough to handle. (The hotter the potatoes are when they are peeled and riced, the lighter the gnocchi will be.) Working quickly and protecting the hand that holds the potatoes with a folded kitchen towel or oven mitt, scrape the skin from the potato with a paring knife. Press the peeled potatoes through a potato ricer. Alternatively, the potatoes can be passed through a food mill fitted with the fine disc, but a ricer makes fluffier potatoes and therefore lighter gnocci. Spread the riced potatoes into a thin, even layer on the work surface, without pressing them or compacting them. Let them cool completely. In a small bowl, beat the egg, salt, and nutmeg together. Gather the cold potatoes into a mound and form a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well. Knead the potato and egg mixtures together with both hands, gradually adding enough of the flour, about 1 1/2 cups, to form a smooth but slightly sticky dough. It should take no longer than 3 minutes to work the flour into the potato mixture; remember, the longer the dough is kneaded, the more flour it will require and the heavier it will become. As you knead the dough, it will stick to your hands and to the work surface: Repeatedly rub this rough dough from your hands and scrape it with a knife or dough scraper from the work surface back into the dough as you knead. Dough is ready to be filled. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 22737,&quot;Crispy Poblano Chiles Stuffed with Black Bean, Pork, Cheese Yellow Rice, and \\Bandera (Mexican Flag)\\ Sauce 1 tablespoon fermented black beans, rinsed and minced 1 tablespoon garlic, minced<br> 2 chopped jalapenos 2 chopped serranos 1 pound ground pork 1/4 cup cilantro, washed, dried, picked, and chopped 1 cup grated Mexican cheese, such as Manchego or Monterey Jack<br> 4 large poblanos, blackened, peeled, seeds removed, slit up one side, and ready to stuff Salt and black pepper Corn oil, to cook 2 cups cooked long grain rice with a pinch of turmeric Corn Tempura batter, recipe follows Bandera Sauce Red, recipe follows Bandera Sauce Green, recipe follows Cilantro Crema, recipe follows Cilantro sprigs, for garnish 1/2 corn meal 1 cup rice flour 1 bottle ice cold sparkling water 4 plum tomatoes, blackened on dry skillet and peeled 2 cloves garlic, toasted in dry skillet 2 chipotle peppers, toasted whole in dry skillet Salt Black pepper 1 small onion, sliced 3 cloves garlic 3 green jalapenos, roasted, de-seeded, de-stemmed 1 cup chicken stock Corn oil, to cook Salt and black pepper 1 cup sour cream 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 1 lime, juiced Salt Pepper Cilantro, for garnish Instructions: Preheat a fryer to 375 degrees F.<br> In a small saute pan coated lightly with oil, saute the black beans and garlic until soft, add the jalapenos, serranos, and saute 2 minutes, add the pork and cook about 8 to 10 minutes on low heat or until cooked through.

Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt to combine. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the eggs and granulated sugar on low speed to thoroughly combine, about 1 minute. Raise the speed and whip until the mixture becomes pale and thick, 5 to 6 minutes. With the mixer running on low speed, add the cream in a slow, steady stream and mix to thoroughly combine. Add the vanilla and mix to combine. Add the flour mixture in 2 to 3 additions, mixing well to fully and smoothly combine. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer, then sprinkle generously with turbinado or sanding sugar. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (or with a few moist crumbs), 65 to 75 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool the cake completely in the pan. For the fruit: Combine the fruit and granulated sugar in a medium bowl and toss well to combine. Macerate at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours before serving. To unmold the cooled cake, run a small offset spatula around the outside edge, then release the outer ring of the pan. Slide an offset spatula under the cake all the way around and gently transfer to a serving platter. Serve slices of cake with a spoonful or two of fruit and their juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 22743,&quot;Red Wine-Poached Fruit 2 firm but ripe pears, peeled, seeded and quartered 1 cup fresh pitted tart cherries 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 cup red wine 2 whole star anise Pinch of kosher salt 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar Vanilla bean ice cream, for serving Instructions: Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Add the pears, cherries, sugar and cornstarch to a large saucepot and mix to coat the fruit. Add the red wine, star anise and salt. Place the saucepot over direct heat, bring the mixture to a boil and cook, simmering, until the wine is reduced and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove the saucepot from the heat and add the red wine vinegar. Discard the star anise. Let cool slightly. Serve by spooning over some vanilla bean ice cream. (Alternatively, you can poach the fruit over medium-high heat on a stovetop.) &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 22744,&quot;Caribbean Jerk Burgers 2 tablespoons reduced-calorie cole slaw dressing or reduced-calorie vegan cole slaw dressing 2 tablespoons fat-free mayonnaise or fat-free vegan mayonnaise 1 1/2 teaspoons Caribbean jerk seasoning 3/4 cup shredded green cabbage or packaged cole slaw mix 3/4 cup shredded red cabbage or packaged cole slaw mix 4 Grillers?

Put on the lid and bring the pot to a boil. After 10 minutes, turn off the burner and strain the bones. Wash the bones under cold water to remove all the scum. Add the cleaned bones back into a clean stock pot, add water and bring to a boil. Char the garlic, ginger, leek and onion in a skillet until they are almost burnt. Set aside. Place the bonito flakes, dried anchovy and kombu in a spice pack and securely tie the end. Put the ground mushroom into a separate spice pack and securely tie the end. Place the charred vegetables, and both spice packs into the pot with the bones. Bring the pot to a boil and boil for 6 hours. Remove the dried anchovy spice pack from the pot. Boil for another 12 hours, then add the salt, sugar and fish powder. Let the broth simmer on low heat for another 6 hours. To create the curry broth, take 64 ounces (2 quarts) of pork broth and add the curry bouillon. Bring to a boil and whisk the broth. For the pork katsu: Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot to 350 degrees F. Tenderize the pork loin using the flat end of a meat mallet and season with salt. Beat the egg and 1 tablespoon water to create an egg wash. Take the pork loin and dredge it in the flour, then the egg wash, then the bread crumbs. Fry the pork loin until golden brown, for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes before cutting. For the ramen bowl: Saute the corn and carrots in a pan with a little oil and set aside. Then saute the cabbage with a little oil. Bring a pot of water to a boil.

Puree, scraping down the sides as needed, until smooth with just a few small chunks remaining. Set aside or refrigerate for up to 3 days in advance. Prepare the steaks: Sprinkle the steaks all over with 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of pepper. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and cook, flipping halfway through, until a nice golden crust has formed on both sides and the temperature registers 125? F (for medium rare) on an instant-read thermometer, 7 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Return the skillet to the heat and turn to medium. Add more butter to the skillet if it is dry and add the za\\u2019atar. Toast until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the peas and saut until tender but still crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate, leaving any remaining butter in the skillet. Mix the arugula and spinach together and place on a platter. Sprinkle with the avocado, radishes, peas and shallots. Slice each steak into thick pieces and place atop the salad. Drizzle with some of the chimichurri and serve immediately with the remaining chimichurri on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</li></ol><p>&quot; 22751,&quot;Pretzel-Crusted Chicken Skewers 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Canola oil, for grilling<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup whole-grain Dijon mustard<br> 1 cup finely crushed pretzels<br> 1/3 cup grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut each piece of chicken lengthwise into 6 slices. Thread each strip through a bamboo skewer. Sprinkle the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Using a rag and tongs, generously oil the grill pan. Place the chicken skewers on the grill. Cook the chicken until lightly charred and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the skewers from the grill to a plate or sheet tray and cover to keep warm. In a small bowl stir together mayonnaise and mustard. Put the crushed pretzels onto a large plate and combine with the grated cheese. Brush a chicken skewer with the Dijon mayonnaise, then roll into the pretzel and cheese mixture to coat completely. Repeat with remaining chicken skewers and serve with extra Dijon mayonnaise for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22752,&quot;Whole Spiny Lobsters Split and Stuffed with Hearts of Palm Slaw 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and pepper 2 (1 1/2 pound) spiny lobsters, split and cleaned 4 small fresh hearts of palm, julienned 1 orange, sectioned and juice reserved 1 yellow or red large round tomato, peeled, seeded, and cut into small strips 1 red onion, julienned 1 bunch cilantro, chopped 1/4 Scotch bonnet cl, seeded and minced 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar Instructions: Preheat a grill.

Just before serving, season with salt and pepper. Place the split lobsters on the grill, flesh side down. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes and then turn over and cook for 5 to 6 more minutes. Place the lobster on serving platters filling in the top, empty part of the shell with the slaw. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 22753,&quot;Lillian Cahn&#39;s Stuffed Chicken Breast Salad 8 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves 3 ounces (6 tablespoons) young, soft goat cheese 1 small clove garlic, peeled and minced Freshly ground black pepper 8 thin slices prosciutto 1 1/4 cups fresh bread crumbs Salt 2 eggs, beaten 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 head romaine salad 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Rinse the chicken well and pat it thoroughly dry. Place the chicken breasts between 2 pieces of waxed paper, and pound on them gently with a rolling pin or a heavy weight until they are about 1/4-inch thick throughout. In a small bowl, mix together the goat cheese, garlic, and a generous amount of pepper. Stuff the chicken breasts. Lay a slice of prosciutto on top of 1 piece of chicken (if the prosciutto is larger than the chicken breast, trim to fit). Place one-eighth of the goat cheese mixture on the top third of the prosciutto, and roll up the chicken breast to enclose the cheese. Set it, seam side down, on a clean counter or plate, and repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. They will stay rolled quite easily without needing anything to secure them. Place the bread crumbs in a shallow bowl or plate, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs in a large shallow bowl and set them next to the bread crumbs. Dip each rolled chicken breast in the bread crumbs to coat it well, then in the beaten egg, then again in the breadcrumbs. Use 1 hand for dipping the chicken in the crumbs, and the other for dipping into the eggs to minimize the amount of crumbs sticking to your fingers. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When it is hot but not smoking, brown the chicken breasts turning them, frequently, until they are golden on all sides, about 7 minutes total. (Do not overcrowd the pan. Brown the chicken breasts in 2 batches if necessary.) Remove them from the pan and arrange them in a single layer in an 8 by 14-inch enamel or ceramic baking dish. Place the dish in the center of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Let cool and refrigerate. Cut into 6 slices. Whisk together oil, vinegar and mustard. Season to taste. Toss salad with vinaigrette. Place on plate. Arrange chicken slices on top of salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 22754,&quot;Gorgonzola and Walnut Fougasse 1 recipe Basic Dough with Pate Fermentee, recipe follows Cornmeal, for dusting, as needed 1 1/2 cups whole or broken walnut halves (about 5 ounces) 7 ounces dry \\mountain-style\\ Gorgonzola cheese (not dulce), crumbled Olive oil, as needed 3 1/2 cups unbleached, unbromated all-purpose flour (1 pound) 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (9 grams) 1 teaspoon minus 1/16 teaspoon instant dry yeast (2.8 grams) 1 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon 63 degree F. water (.67 pound)<br> Instructions: Place a baking stone in the middle of the oven and preheat to 470 degrees F.<br> On a lightly floured work surface, cut the dough into 4 equal pieces with a bench scraper.<br> Using your fingertips, flatten the dough pieces. Transfer 1 of the pieces to the back of a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and lightly dusted with cornmeal. Cover generously with walnuts and Gorgonzola and top with another piece of dough. Press down on the edges to seal. Using a small palette knife, cut 8 evenly spaced holes in the dough. Stretch the dough to enlarge the holes. Lightly brush the fougasse with olive oil and cover lightly with plastic wrap. Place the loaf in a warm place and let rise for 30 minutes. Repeat to make 1 more loaf.<br> Working with 1 loaf a time, slide the fougasse, still on the parchment paper, onto the baking stone. Bake until crispy and brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the fougasse to a rack to cool. Repeat with the remaining loaf. Pate Fermentee just means \\old dough. \\Old dough?, you say. Well, this old dough is basically a starter that is made the day before, and cuts down on the time you eventually spend in the kitchen. Nothing wrong with that. It also makes the bread last longer, gives it a slightly acidic and subtly complex flavor, and helps the inside of the bread form tiny irregular holes that are a sign of great artisanal bread (called \\crumb\\ in baker-speak).<br> If you can, try weighing out the ingredients, instead of using measuring cups and spoons\\u2014it&#39;s much more accurate.<br> Use this dough to make Scali, an Italian sesame seed-crusted bread, or Gorgonzola and Walnut Fougasse\\u2014or both.<br> 1 recipe refrigerated Pate Fermentee (1 3/4 pounds), recipe follows<br> 1 1/2 cups minus 1 tablespoon 80 degree F. water (.71 pound) 3 1/2 cups unbleached, unbromated all-purpose flour (1 pound)<br> 1 teaspoon minus 1/16 teaspoon instant dry yeast (2.8 grams)<br> 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (9 grams) In a large mixing bowl, combine the pate fermentee and water and, using your hands, break up the dough into the water.<br> In another bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the pate fermentee mixture and mix by hand until firm and cohesive, about 3 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough until very elastic and smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 78 degrees F. Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap (the plastic should not touch the dough). Place the bowl in a warm place (about 75 to 78 degrees F.) and let rise for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes, fold the dough and turn it over in the bowl. (It will somewhat deflate the dough, but it is gentler than what&#39;s commonly referred to as \\punching down.)<br> Let the dough rise, undisturbed, for 1 hour more. (The dough will rise considerably at this point.)<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough gently into a rectangle, to degas it. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and, using your hands, mix until incorporated, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, mix in a mixer on the lowest setting possible.) Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm place (about 75 degrees F.). Let the dough ferment for 1 hour. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 75 degrees F.<br> Refrigerate the dough at least 10 hours and up to 36 hours. When ready, it will be roughly doubled in size and have a fine network of filaments and holes. Make this recipe the night before you mix the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 22755,&quot;Barley Bread 10 ounces barley flour, approximately 3 cups 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 ounce baking powder, approximately 2 1/2 tablespoons 2 tablespoons honey 1/4 cup canola oil, plus extra for pan 2 eggs 1 cup whole milk Instructions: Preheat a gas grill on low heat for at least 10 minutes.

Add the egg and yolks to the center of the well. Using a fork, slowly start to incorporate the flour into the eggs to form a rough dough. You may add a splash of water if the dough is too dry or a dusting of flour if it is too wet. Lightly flour a smooth work surface and pour the dough onto the flour. Knead the dough until it springs back when you press a finger into it, 10 to 12 minutes. Flatten the dough into an even square. Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Cut the dough into 3 pieces. Set up a pasta roller according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions and set it at the widest setting. Dust one section of the dough with semolina flour and press firmly to flatten the dough to 1/4 inch. Roll the dough through the machine on the widest setting. Fold the pasta dough in thirds and dust the outside with flour. Send it through the widest setting again. Reduce the setting to the next setting. Send the dough through the machine. Fold it in thirds once again and send through the setting one more time. Continue sending the dough through the machine, reducing the setting each time, until the desired thickness is reached, about 1/8 inch. Lay the sheet out on the counter and dust with flour.

Place the rockfish in the bowl and marinate for 5 to 7 minutes. Cut bottoms of the bok choy and wash, making sure there&#39;s no sand in between the leaves. Trim the bottom of the mushrooms and separate the mushrooms so they&#39;re not too clumped together. Drizzle the grapeseed oil on the vegetables and salt them. Heat a grill pan over high heat for 5 minutes. You want it nice and hot! When a drop of water instantly sizzles and evaporates, add the bok choy and mushrooms. It&#39;s ok if the grill pan is crowded ? that&#39;s what creates the steam. Grill until the bok choy and mushrooms have some char, about 3 minutes. Move the vegetable aside. Remove the rockfish from the marinade and place skin-side down on the grill pan. Cover the top of the fillets with the vegetables, reduce the heat to medium and cover with aluminum foil. Grill/steam the fish and vegetables for 12 to 17 minutes, depending on how thick your fillet is. You may lift the foil to check on it. If the middle of the fillet flakes easily, it&#39;s ready. Pulse the scallions, ginger, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor. If you can find it, add a head of black garlic because it adds a nice sweetness.

Regulate the heat so the vegetables cook without taking on color. Add the thyme and stir. Add the broccoli stems, stock, and salt and pepper, to taste, and bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for about 3 minutes. Add the florets and continue to cook until very tender, about 5 minutes more. Puree the soup in a blender in small batches. Add some of the spinach and some of the lemon zest to each batch and then puree it. (The soup can be made to this point, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month.) Return the soup to the pan and reheat over gentle heat. Stir in the cream. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm. To serve: 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese, optional 2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds, optional Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and cinnamon stick and saute until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken stock and the coriander, if using, and bring to a boil. Simmer for several minutes. Stir in the squash until smooth, then simmer gently to let the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick. Puree the soup in a blender until smooth. (The soup can be made ahead to this point, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for several days or frozen for about 1 month. It will thicken as it cools and may need thinning with stock or water when reheating.) Return the soup to the pan and reheat gently. Add the half-and-half, if using. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm until service. To serve: Ladle the soup into serving bowls. Garnish evenly, with the cheese and pumpkin seeds, if desired. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), molasses and toasted spice rub. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny. Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Serving suggestions: Serve the puree on its own as a side dish for roast chicken, turkey, or pork; stir into polenta just before the end of cooking; use as a stuffing for ravioli; make into a soup; or use to flavor pastina. Or omit the sage, season with ground cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to taste, and use as a substitute for canned pumpkin in your favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Variation for Smoky Butternut Squash: Cook the prepared squash on a baking sheet in a covered grill with soaked chips to give a slightly smoky taste. Substitute in any of the recipes that call for roasted squash. If cooking kabocha, acorn, or other difficult-to-peel squash, cut in half, scoop out the seeds, and rub the insides and cut edges with the vinegar/molasses mixture. Place on a baking sheet, cut sides up, and roast at 400 degrees F until tender. Scoop out and puree. Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put mixture into a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Taste your chili powder before adding and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chilies are almost sweet, not hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22784,&quot;Gold Miner&#39;s Chili 1 1/2 cups finely minced white onion 8 garlic cloves, finely minced 2 (15 1/2-ounce) cans chicken broth, with fat removed 4 ounces tomato sauce 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder 3 tablespoons ground cumin 10 1/2 tablespoons chili powder or 5 tablespoons California cl powder (mild) 4 1/2 tablespoons New Mexico cl powder (medium) 1 tablespoon New Mexico cl powder (hot) 2 teaspoons salt 3 pounds beef, cut into 1/4-inch cubes 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 teaspoon meat tenderizer 1/2 teaspoon light brown sugar 1 teaspoon hot red pepper sauce Instructions: In a large pot simmer onion and minced garlic in 2 cups of chicken broth for 10 minutes.

In a glass baking dish, combine the zest and all but 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice with 1/4 cup of the olive oil, the shallot, garlic, and a little more than 2 tablespoons of each of the chopped fresh herbs. (Reserve the remaining chopped herbs.) Add the pounded chicken breasts to the herb mixture and turn to coat. Season generously with salt and pepper, cover the dish with plastic wrap, and put in the refrigerator to marinate, at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the chicken breasts to the pan and cook, turning once, until cooked through and golden brown on both sides, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Cook the breasts 2 at a time if the pan is too small. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the white wine to the pan, scraping to loosen any brown bits, and reduce until almost dry. Add the chicken broth and reduce by half, then off the heat add the reserved herbs and cold butter, swirling to melt the butter and thicken the sauce. Pour over the chicken paillards and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22786,&quot;Mini Egg and Cheese Breakfast Burritos 4 eggs, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon butter<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1/2 cup grated Cheddar 2 tablespoons chopped roasted peppers Eight 4-inch flour tortillas<br> Instructions: In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the eggs with the butter, stirring constantly, until the eggs are slightly runny, about 3 minutes Take them off the heat and season with salt and pepper.

Place the cauliflower into a steamer basket fitted over the pot, cover, and steam until just tender, about 5 minutes. Finely chop the steamed cauliflower. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, and oil. In a large saucepan, whisk together the milk and flour until the flour is dissolved. Whisking constantly, bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until the mixture thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the cheddar, Gruyere, mustard powder, paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Whisk until the cheeses are melted and the mixture is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chopped cauliflower and macaroni and stir until well coated. Spray an ovenproof 10-inch high-sided skillet with cooking spray. Pour the mixture into the prepared skillet. Sprinkle with the bread crumb mixture, place on a baking sheet, and bake until the top is browned and the cheese is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Homemade bread crumbs are one of those \\chef&#39;s secrets\\ ? important but often overlooked detail that can make a dish. These easy-to-make crumbs are flaky, mild, and versatile?they don&#39;t have that heavy whole-wheat taste and dense texture that most store-bought brands have. Since bread crumbs are a comfort-food cornerstone used in everything from cutlet coatings to casserole toppings, it&#39;s key to have the best. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Place the bread in a food processor and process until fine crumbs form, 25 to 30 seconds. Place the crumbs on a baking sheet, spreading them evenly. Bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Store the bread crumbs in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22790,&quot;Peanut Butter Layer Cake with Peanut Butter Frosting 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pans 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 cup packed light brown sugar 2/3 cup smooth peanut butter 1/2 cup granulated sugar 4 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup milk 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 5 large egg whites Pinch fine salt 1 1/4 cups smooth peanut butter 4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Crushed peanut brittle, for decorating Instructions: For the cake: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, and line the bottom of each with a round piece of parchment. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda together onto a piece of parchment or into a large bowl. Beat the butter, brown sugar, peanut butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until the mixture is light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low, and add the flour mixture in 3 additions and the milk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the flour. Beat until just combined. Evenly divide the batter among the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for a few minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely. Invert each onto a cooling rack, and remove the parchment. (The cakes can be stored at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 1 day.) For the buttercream: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan large enough to hold the heatproof bowl of a stand mixer above the water. Whisk together the granulated sugar, egg whites and salt in the stand mixer bowl. Set the bowl above the boiling water, and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar has completely dissolved. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, about 5 minutes. Beat in 3/4 cup of the peanut butter until smooth. Beat in a couple of chunks of butter at a time, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. Continue beating on medium-high speed until the buttercream thickens into stiff peaks. (The mixture at some point may appear to be very liquidy, but continue to beat.) Beat in the vanilla. To assemble: Slice each cake in half, for a total of 4 cake rounds. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup peanut butter on 3 of the rounds, dividing evenly. Put 1 round, peanut butter-side up, on a cake stand or serving platter, and spread about 3/4 cup of the buttercream on top, leaving about a 1/2-inch border all around. Repeat with 2 more layers of peanut-buttered cake and buttercream. Place the last cake round (without the peanut butter) on top. Frost the outside of the cake with the remaining buttercream. Refrigerate the cake until it sets up (this makes it possible to cut neat slices), at least 4 hours up to overnight. Sprinkle the top with peanut brittle before serving. Serve chilled or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 22791,&quot;Potato Chip-Chocolate Chunk Cookies 5 cups kettle-cooked potato chips (from one 8-ounce bag) 5 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped (or 1 cup chocolate chunks) 5 ounces caramel milk chocolate (such as mini Ghirardelli bars), chopped 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 1/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Flaky sea salt, for topping Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Put 2 heaping cups potato chips in a large bowl and add the semisweet and caramel milk chocolates; set aside. Put the remaining 3 cups potato chips in a resealable plastic bag and finely crush with the bottom of a measuring cup; transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on high speed until very fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, then add the vanilla, beating well after each addition until creamy. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually beat in the flour mixture until combined. Add the potato chip?chocolate mixture and beat until combined. Roll the dough into large balls (about 1/4 cup dough each), then roll in the crushed potato chips. Arrange 2 inches apart on 3 unlined baking sheets. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are browned around the edges but still soft, 20 to 22 minutes. Immediately sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Transfer the pans to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then slide a spatula under the cookies and transfer to the racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 22792,&quot;Easy Kids&#39; Lunches: Fun Shaped Sandwiches 2 slices whole-grain bread 2 slices low-sodium smoked turkey breast 1 slice reduced-fat Cheddar 1 tablespoon hummus 2 slices tomato 1 thin slice cucumber 1 small lettuce leaf Instructions: Punch shapes out of the bread with a cookie cutter.

Set aside. For the crepe batter: Place all ingredients in a blender and process until smooth. Let the batter stand for 30 minutes to allow any bubbles to settle. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For the sauce: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the poblano chiles and cook for 1 minute to blend flavors. Add the heavy cream and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until reduced and the cream coats back of spoon, about 6 minutes. Cool mixture slightly then transfer to blender and process until smooth. Season the poblano sauce with salt and pepper, to taste. Return the sauce to the same skillet and keep warm over low heat until ready to serve. Heat a 10-inch-diameter non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Brush the pan with oil (or spray with non-stick cooking spray). Add scant 1/4 cupful batter to the skillet; tilt to coat the bottom of the pan with an even layer of batter. Cook for about 30 to 45 seconds until golden on the bottom, adjusting the heat, as necessary, to prevent burning, Using a spatula, turn the crepe over and cook for 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter. Stuff each crepe with 1/4 cup of grated cheese and transfer to the prepared backing dish, fitting them snugly into dish.

Uncover and continue cooking until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F, 10 to 15 minutes more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22798,&quot;Hasselback Roasted Potatoes 2 pounds potatoes, medium sized (your choice of type) Salt 1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup canola, vegetable or grapeseed oil 1/4 cup very finely parsley leaves Instructions: Peel the potatoes and rinse to remove any traces of dirt. Cut into the potatoes into uniform pieces. (This will help in cooking time if they are all similar.) Take a sharp knife and beginning on 1 end, cut about 2/3 through the potato. Repeat the same incision from 1 end of the potato to the other, spacing the cuts uniformly. (The idea is to create the look of a fan, which is why you don&#39;t cut all the way through the potato.) Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Add a pinch of salt and cook until just tender. (Do not overcook. The potatoes should remain a little hard, as they will continue to cook during roasting.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Drain the potatoes and place them on absorbent toweling to remove excess water. Mix the flour and salt and pepper, to taste, in a bowl and carefully toss with the already blanched potatoes. Place the floured potatoes onto a baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Bake until golden brown, approximately 30 to 40 minutes. To finish, scoop the potatoes with a slotted spoon onto absorbent paper toweling and to drain any excess oil. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 22799,&quot;Sweet Potato or Pumpkin Biscuits 2 1/4 cups commercial or homemade Self-Rising Flour (recipe follows), divided 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional) 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional) 1/3 cup chilled shortening or lard, roughly cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup mashed cooked sweet potatoes or pumpkin puree 1/4 cup milk (optional) 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons buttermilk or milk Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Select the baking pan by determining if a soft or crisp exterior is desired. For a soft exterior, use an 8- or 9-inch cake pan, pizza pan, or ovenproof skillet where the biscuits will nestle together snugly, creating the soft exterior while baking. For a crisp exterior, select a baking sheet or other baking pan where the biscuits can be placed wider apart, allowing air to circulate and creating a crisper exterior, and brush the pan with butter. Fork-sift or whisk 2 cups of flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl, preferably wider than it is deeper, and set aside the remaining 1/4 cup of flour. Scatter lard over the flour and work in by rubbing fingers with the lard and flour as if snapping thumb and fingers together (or use two forks or knives, or a pastry cutter) until the mixture looks like well-crumbled feta cheese, with no piece larger than a pea. Shake the bowl occasionally to allow the larger pieces of fat to bounce to the top of the flour, revealing the largest lumps that still need rubbing. If this method took longer than 5 minutes, place the bowl in the refrigerator for 5 minutes to rechill the fat.<br> Make a deep hollow in the center of the flour with the back of your hand. Scoop the sweet potatoes into the hollow and stir with a rubber spatula or large metal spoon, using broad circular strokes to quickly pull the flour into the sweet potatoes. Mix just until the dry ingredients are moistened and the sticky dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If too dry, add 1 to 4 tablespoons of milk. Lightly sprinkle a board or other clean surface with some of the reserved flour. Turn the dough out onto the board and sprinkle the top lightly with flour. With floured hands, fold the dough in half, and pat dough out into a 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick round, using a little additional flour only if needed. Flour again if necessary, and fold the dough in half a second time. If the dough is still clumpy, pat and fold a third time. Pat dough out into a 1/2-inch-thick round for a normal biscuit, 3/4-inch-thick for a tall biscuit, and 1-inch-thick for a giant biscuit. Brush off any visible flour from the top. For each biscuit, dip a 2-inch biscuit cutter into the reserved flour and cut out the biscuits, starting at the outside edge and cutting very close together, being careful not to twist the cutter. The scraps may be combined to make additional biscuits, although these scraps make tougher biscuits.<br> Using a metal spatula if necessary, move the biscuits to the pan or baking sheet. Bake the biscuits on the top rack of the oven for a total of 12 to 14 minutes, depending on thickness, until light golden brown. After 6 minutes, rotate the pan in the oven so that the front of the pan is now turned to the back, and check to see if the bottoms are browning too quickly. If so, slide another baking pan underneath to add insulation and retard browning. Continue baking another 6 to 8 minutes until the biscuits are light golden brown.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk until smooth to make an icing. When the biscuits are done, remove from oven and slide them onto a rack over a piece of wax paper. Drizzle the icing over the warm biscuits. Discard the paper with the excess icing. Serve hot right away.

Marinate the pork belly. Saute the shallots. Put the sweet rice in a large mixing bowl and add 4 quarts of water. Soak, uncovered, in the refrigerator overnight. Put the mung beans in a mixing bowl and add 1 quart of water. Soak, uncovered, in the refrigerator overnight. Cut the pork belly into 1/2-inch-thick slices, then cut the slices into 2-inch segments. Combine the sliced pork, fish sauce and 2 teaspoons of the black pepper in a mixing bowl. Toss to coat the pork in the marinade. Cover the pork and marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Add the coconut oil to a saute pan over medium heat. Add the shallots to the oil. Saute the shallots, stirring continuously, until aromatic and softened, 3 to 6 minutes. Transfer the shallots to a mixing bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper on the shallots and stir to combine. Cover the shallots and refrigerate until it\\u2019s time to wrap the bnh ch?ng. Day 2: Steam the mung beans. Prepare the banana leaves. Build and fill the banana leaf box. Cook the bnh ch?ng. To steam the mung beans: Drain the mung beans in a colander. Add them back to the bowl, cover with clean water, rinse and drain again. Repeat once more. Transfer the beans to a steamer lined with cheesecloth. Steam the beans over medium-high heat until tender, at least 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, test the doneness of the beans by removing a single bean and pressing it between your fingers. If the bean mashes easily, it\\u2019s done. If not, continue steaming until done. Transfer the beans to a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the remaining 1 3/4 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper onto the hot beans. Stir to equally disburse the salt and pepper. Cover the beans and refrigerate until it\\u2019s time to assemble the bnh ch?ng. Drain the sweet rice in a colander. Add it back to the bowl, cover with clean water, rinse and drain again. Repeat once more. Set aside to drain further. To prepare the banana leaves: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. Wash the banana leaves. Along the grain, cut the banana leaves into 4-inch-wide strips. Working in batches, quickly dunk the banana strips into the boiling water, then immediately plunge them into the ice water. Remove the strips from the water, dry and set them aside. To build a banana leaf box: Make a fold 4 inches into a banana strip. Place the strip inside a 3.75-by-3.75-by-2-inch bnh ch?ng mold (see Cook&#39;s Note), with the folded edge flush against the left wall of the mold. Make a corresponding fold that lays flush against the right wall of the mold. Fold another banana strip 4 inches into the strip. Place the fold inside the mold, with the folded edge flushed against the top wall of the mold. Make a corresponding fold that lays flush against the bottom wall of the mold. Repeat with 4 more banana strips, alternating the direction of the banana strips. Insert 2 leaves along the interior perimeter of the mold. The resulting banana leaf box is ready for filling. To add the bnh ch?ng filling: Spoon 1 cup of the rice into the box. Tamp the rice down to create a level bottom and build the rice up the sides of the box. Place 2 slices of the pork belly in the center of the box, avoiding the sides of the box. Add 2 tablespoons of the mung beans and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the shallots to the center of the box, again avoiding the sides of the box. Add 1/3 cup of the rice to the box and tamp the rice down so that it\\u2019s level with the lip of the box. Fold down the leaves to enclose the box. Trim off any overhang. Lay a 3-foot-long piece of kitchen twine across the top of the box. Carefully flip the box. Remove the mold. Wrap the twine around the box to bind the leaves into a tight parcel, like you would a birthday present. Set the bnh ch?ng aside and repeat with the remaining banana strips, filling and twine. The bnh ch?ng can now be pressure cooked or steamed on the stovetop. To pressure cook the bnh ch?ng: Place the bnh ch?ng parcels in a 6-quart Instant Pot? and add water to cover them by 1 inch. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 45 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note).\\u202f After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. Or to cook the bnh ch?ng on the stovetop: Place a wire rack inside a tall stockpot with a tight-fitting lid. Place the bnh ch?ng in the pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the bnh ch?ng by 12 inches. Bring the water to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat and simmer for 8 hours. Transfer the bnh ch?ng to a baking sheet. If not serving immediately, rest the bnh ch?ng until they\\u2019re cool enough to handle. Wipe down the bnh ch?ng and store in the refrigerator. To reheat, steam the bnh ch?ng until warmed through, 10 to 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 22831,&quot;PB &amp; J Cups 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Nonstick cooking spray 6 tablespoons strawberry jelly Flaky sea salt, for garnish (optional) Instructions: Line 8 cups in a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler (set a heatproof bowl over a saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water) over medium heat. Stir the chocolate occasionally, until melted, about 5 minutes. Once the chocolate is melted, turn the heat off. Meanwhile, add the peanut butter and confectioners&#39; sugar to a mixing bowl. Mix with a hand mixer until well combined. Set the peanut butter mixture aside. Spoon 1 tablespoon of melted chocolate into each cupcake liner. Use a 1-tablespoon size cookie scoop to portion the peanut butter mixture on to your hand. If the mixture is too sticky, lightly spray your hands with nonstick cooking spray. Slightly flatten the peanut butter, but make sure to keep it smaller than the base of the muffin cup so that the chocolate can encase it. Place the peanut butter on top of the chocolate, slightly pressing to let the chocolate come slightly up the sides of the peanut butter. Repeat the process to fill the remaining 7 muffin cups. Next, use a 1/2-tablespoon size cookie scoop to scoop a portion of jelly on top of the peanut butter. To finish the cups, top the peanut butter and jelly with an additional tablespoon of melted chocolate. Use a spoon to spread the chocolate to completely cover the peanut butter and jelly. Sprinkle each cup with flake salt, if desired. Transfer the muffin tin to the fridge for 30 minutes, until completely set.

Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer and cook until the jowls are fork-tender throughout, about 2 hours 30 minutes. Set aside to cool in cooking liquid. Slice each jowl across the grain into about six 1/4-inch-thick slices. For the amatriciana sauce: Slice the Pancetta into 1/8-inch-thick slices, then cut the slices into 3/4-inch squares. Set aside. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed saucepot over medium-high heat and add onions and pancetta. Turn heat to high and cook, stirring occasionally, until well caramelized. Add the tomatoes, red pepper flakes and garlic and stir to mix well. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm. Season to taste. Heat a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Cook until smoking, then add 2 to 3 slices jowl to the pan. (Don&#39;t crowd them in the pan; give them room to breathe.) Caramelize both sides of the jowl slices until crisped, then remove them to a paper towel to absorb excess oil. Continue with remaining slices. Arrange the slices on a large platter and spoon a generous amount of amatriciana sauce on top.

Cut 4 tablespoons of the butter into pieces and top the gnocchi mixture with the butter pieces and sage leaves. Place on the middle rack and bake, stirring halfway through, until the gnocchi are tender, 16 to 18 minutes. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and keep warm. When the gnocchi are tender, drizzle the mixture with the butter and gently stir to combine with a rubber spatula. Scoop the mixture into a large serving bowl and garnish with the Parmesan and basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 22837,&quot;OSM Waffle 4 eggs 1 quart milk 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 3 cups whole-wheat flour 1/2 cup oats 1/3 cup millet 1/3 cup sunflower seeds 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup cracked wheat 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 cup melted butter Instructions: In a medium bowl, mix the eggs, milk, and brown sugar.

Peel the potatoes and cut into desired French-fry size. Place in a plastic bag along with the oil and shake until potatoes are evenly coated. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Put the potatoes on the baking sheet in a single layer and sprinkle with cayenne and black pepper. Bake, turning potatoes once, until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, to make the ketchup: Stir all ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside. If you like it chunky serve as is. If you don&#39;t want the ketchup chunky, put ingredients into a food processor to puree. When the fries are done, sprinkle with salt and serve immediately with the ketchup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22839,&quot;Grilled Chicken Thighs with Blackberry BBQ Sauce 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 tablespoon kosher salt 8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs Olive oil 1/2 recipe Blackberry BBQ Sauce 3 pints fresh blackberries 12 ounces dark beer 1 cup balsamic vinegar 1 cup red wine vinegar 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1 onion, sliced 1 clove garlic, minced 1 habanero pepper, slit 1 tablespoon ground chipotle cl powder 1 tablespoon finely ground coffee 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon ground cumin Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the coriander, paprika and salt. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels, season on both sides with the spice mixture and place in a gallon-size zip-top bag. Refrigerate for several hours but preferably overnight. Prepare and preheat your lump charcoal grill to create two heat zones: high and low. Brush the chicken thighs with olive oil and place them skin-side down on the hot side of the grill. Cover and cook for 2 minutes. Uncover and move the chicken to the low side of the grill, skin-side up. Cover and cook until the thighs reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour half the Blackberry BBQ Sauce into a medium bowl and use it to baste the chicken occasionally during the final 10 minutes of cooking. Remove the chicken from the grill. Serve with the remaining sauce on the side. In a large saucepan, combine the blackberries, beer, vinegars, sugar, onion, garlic, habanero, chipotle powder, coffee, coriander and cumin. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 2 hours. Carefully puree the sauce in a blender or food processor, then strain. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 22840,&quot;Orange Panna Cotta 1 tablespoon powdered gelatin 3 tablespoons water 4 cups heavy cream, or a combination of cream with milk or buttermilk 3/4 cup sugar 6 wide strips fresh orange peel (orange part only-no white pith) 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise Semisweet chocolate curls, for garnish (optional) Orange supremes (segments), for garnish Instructions: In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let soak 10 minutes (do not stir). Meanwhile, heat the cream, sugar, orange peel, and vanilla in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, to dissolve the sugar. As soon as it simmers, turn off the heat and add the gelatin mixture, stirring to dissolve the gelatin. (If the gelatin doesn?t completely dissolve in 3 minutes, return to the heat and warm gently until dissolved.) Strain the mixture into a pitcher to remove the vanilla bean and orange rind. Pour the mixture into 6 to 8 ramekins or dessert cups, or into 1 larger dish. Chill, uncovered, at least 3 hours. To unmold, dip the cups in hot water for 10 seconds, then turn the panna cottas out onto dessert plates (or, simply serve in the cups or by the spoonful). Shave some chocolate curls onto the top of the panna cottas and serve with the orange supremes. Notes about the recipe: I love panna cotta because you can combine milks and creams to make it sweeter, more tart, or creamier. And then the flavor can be anything you can imagine goes well with dairy?raspberry, citrus, coffee, tea, what ever! So it&#39;s one of those really flexible desserts that you can tailor to fit the flavors in the rest of your menu, and \\flexible\\ almost never happens when it comes to a dessert recipe. Also, you can vary the container you make it in and turn it out to serve it or leave it in. Try using eggcups, demitasse cups, a hollowed out clean eggshell, shot glasses, anything will do. These are ingredients you might already have in your kitchen, too, so it cuts down on shopping, which is key for me. When I want to cook, I want to get right to it and not have to make a trip to the grocery just to get my hands into some dessert! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 22841,&quot;Savory Mushroom Dressing 8 slices white bread, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms, such as cremini and shiitake 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 shallots, sliced 4 cloves chopped garlic 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary 1/4 cup Cognac, or other brandy 2 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 cup heavy cream 3 large eggs, beaten Freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Set the ice cream cones in the cups of in two 12-cup muffin pans so they stand upright. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cake mix, eggs, oil and 1 cup cold water. Beat on low speed just to combine, then increase the speed to high and beat until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Divide the mixture among the ice cream cones. Bake until the cupcakes rise above the edges of the cones and a tester inserted in the center of 1 comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to cooling racks and cool completely. Set aside about 1/4 cup vanilla frosting in a small bowl. Put the remaining frosting in a clean mixer bowl and add about 1/2 teaspoon blue food coloring. Beat and continue to add food coloring, if necessary, to get a sea blue color. Dollop a tiny bit of frosting on the bottom of a cone (this will help anchor it to the serving tray) and then dollop a generous amount on top. Anchor the cone to the serving tray and repeat with the remaining cones, arranging them in a 4-by-6 cone grid, with the edges touching. Using an offset spatula, smooth the blue frosting across the tops of the cupcakes, adding more as necessary, so it appears as 1 layer and the individual cupcakes are no longer visible. Smooth the remaining blue frosting on the sides to cover the cupcakes but not the cones. Pat the graham cracker crumbs onto one half of the cake, creating a wavy pattern along one edge where the water meets the sandy beach. Put the reserved white frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a large leaf tip. Pipe the white frosting along the edge where the water and sand meet to make breaking waves. To decorate the beach half of the cake, arrange the blue rock candy just behind the breaking waves to create the crashing surf. Stick some beach umbrellas in the sand, making sure you stick them into the cakes and not the frosted spaces between them. Cut the taffy into beach towels and arrange some cookie bears on the towels on the beach. Arrange some piles of candy rocks on the beach. To make palm trees, sprinkle your work surface with a little sugar and roll or flatten the lime fruit slice candies. Cut into 5 palm leaves. (If you have time, let the leaves dry and harden for 1/2 hour or so, they will stick up straighter on the finished tree). Break the pretzel rod in half and stick the leaves on top to make a palm tree. Stick the tree into one of the cupcakes on the beach. Attach one end of the twist tie to a gummy candy fish and wrap the other end around the remaining half of the pretzel rod to make a fishing pole. Stick the pole in the sand and add a cookie bear as a fisherman. To decorate the ocean half of the cake, arrange gummy candy sea creatures in the water. Stick some cookie bears into gummy candy rings and set them in the ocean to float. Press or roll the caramel candy to flatten and then crimp the edges to make a boat. Attach a square sticky note to a toothpick to make a sail. Stick it in the boat, along with a cookie bear as a sailor. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 22851,&quot;Sole Meunire with Sage Brown Butter and Pumpkin Seed Pesto Neutral cooking oil, such as canola or vegetable oil, for frying 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds 1 clove garlic 2 cups fresh parsley leaves 1/2 cup pumpkin seed oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Juice of 1/2 lemon, or as needed 2 whole sole, filleted Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup clarified butter 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes 12 fresh sage leaves 1 lemon, halved Instructions: For the pumpkin seed pesto: Heat the cooking oil to 375 degrees F in a deep-fryer or heavy saucepan. Add the pumpkin seeds and fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with a paper towel. Place the fried pumpkin seeds, garlic and parsley in a high-powered blender. Begin to blend on low speed, using the plunger as needed to help blend the ingredients. Drizzle in the pumpkin seed oil with the motor running. Increase the speed to high and blend until smooth, using the plunger as needed. Season the pesto with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. For the sole: Pat the fish dry on both sides and season them generously all over with salt and pepper. Coat both sides of the fish with flour. Add half the clarified butter to a very large cast-iron skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add one of the sole fillets and cook until golden brown on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes. Add half the cubed butter to the pan along with half of the sage leaves. Flip the fish and baste the top with some of the melted butter and herbs. Cook until the bottom is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the sole to a serving platter. Squeeze the juice from half of the lemon over the remaining melted butter and sage leaves in the pan and swirl the pan to combine. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the cooked sole. Repeat with the remaining sole fillet, clarified butter, cubed butter, sage and lemon.

Season to taste with salt. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to serve. For the arancini: Remove 1 cup of the frozen peas and reserve for later use. Put the remaining peas in a blender with 1 cup of the vegetable stock and puree until smooth. Pour the pea mixture into a medium saucepot and add the remaining 3 cups stock and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a low simmer over medium-low heat. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the rice and cook until opaque and lightly toasted. Stir in the shallot and garlic; cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes to toast the garlic and soften the shallot. Deglaze the pot with the white wine, then bring to a boil and cook until almost completely reduced. Ladle in one-third of the hot stock, lower the heat to medium, and bring the stock to a simmer, stirring often. Continue to stir the rice for 8 minutes while the stock reduces almost completely. When there is more rice in the pot than liquid, add another third of the stock and repeat stirring and reducing the stock for another 8 minutes. Add the remaining stock and this time reduce just until the rice is thick enough that a spoon leaves a momentary trail when dragged along the bottom of the pot. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, Parmesan, lemon zest, reserved peas, and additional salt and black pepper to taste. Lightly grease a baking sheet with canola oil and spread the risotto in an even layer; set aside to cool. When the risotto is room temperature, cover it with plastic wrap, pressed directly to the surface of the rice, and refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight. Form the chilled risotto into 19 arancini balls, about 1/4 cup each. Flatten each ball with the palm of your hand, place a heaping teaspoon of mozzarella in the center and fold the sides up and around the cheese. Roll back into balls. (At this point, you can hold the arancini overnight on a baking sheet covered with plastic wrap.) When ready to fry, heat 2 to 3 inches of canola oil to 350 degrees F in a large cast-iron pan. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Whisk the eggs together in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. In a second shallow dish, add the panko and season with salt and pepper. Dip the arancini in the egg and then coat in the panko. In batches of a few at a time, fry the arancini, turning, until deep golden-brown and crispy on all sides, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towels; immediately season with salt. Serve hot with the dipping sauce. Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat; add the honey and olive oil. When the honey is melted, stir to combine, then place the lemon halves, cut-side down, into the mixture. Cook until the lemons appear charred and the honey has caramelized to the cut surfaces, about 4 minutes. Remove the lemons to a baking sheet and let to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 22853,&quot;Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Mai Tai 4 fresh blackberries 2 ounces white rum, such as Sammy&#39;s Beach Bar Rum 1/2 ounce ginger liqueur, such as Canton&#39;s, or ginger syrup 2 ounces guava nectar 2 ounces pineapple juice 1/2 ounce fresh lime juice 3 dashes Angostura bitters Ice Cherry, for garnish Instructions: In a mixing glass, muddle the blackberries, and then add the guava nectar, pineapple juice, white rum, ginger liqueur, lime juice and bitters.

Add the flour and start mixing on low. After the flour and water have started to mix, add the salt. Let mix for another minute until all of the flour from the sides of the bowl have been incorporated. If the dough is sticking to the side of the bowl, add flour slowly until it starts to firm up around the dough hook. Add the olive oil and mix for another 5 minutes. Let the dough rest in the bowl, covered, for 10 minutes. In the meantime, spray a baking sheet or aluminum pan with cooking spray. After the dough is done resting, empty it onto a lightly floured prep surface. Weigh the dough out into three 10-ounce portions. In your hands, fold the dough into itself, tightening the dough and removing air pockets with each fold. Add flour to your hands if the dough is too sticky. When the dough is tight enough to hold its shape, put it on to the greased baking sheet and spray the top with a little of the cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof at room temperature for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The dough should at least double in size. You can also proof in the fridge overnight and leave it out 30 minutes before you are ready to use it the next day. For the garlic ricotta: While the dough is proofing, make the roasted garlic ricotta, sliced zucchini and charred red onions. (Start roasting the garlic right away as it will take the most time.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut off the tops of the heads of garlic. Drizzle the olive oil over the tops of the garlic, wrap in aluminum foil and roast for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Once tender, remove from the oven and let cool. In a stainless bowl, squeeze out the roasted garlic. Add a splash of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Using a spatula, smooth the garlic into a paste in the bowl. Add the ricotta and fold in the garlic until it is completely incorporated. For the charred red onions: Turn the oven temperature up to 500 degrees F. Cut the ends off the onions, and peel off the tough outer layer. Cut in half lengthwise and thinly slice. Toss in olive oil and cook on a baking sheet in the oven of 15 to 20 minutes until you see a good bit of charred pieces. Cool. For the zucchini: While the onions cook, cut the ends off of the zucchini and squash and thinly slice on a bias. Toss in a metal bowl with the olive oil, pepper flakes, lemon zest and salt and pepper. To assemble the pizza: Leave the oven temperature at 500 degrees F, and lightly flour a smooth work surface. Take out one of the dough balls. Starting at the edges, gently press down on the dough, being careful not to pull at it. Continue pressing the edges and work towards the center, keeping the dough round. Make sure to flour both sides at least twice during this process. Once you&#39;ve stretched the dough to about 14 inches, move it onto a round aluminum pizza pan or a wooden peel if you plan on sliding it on to a pizza stone. Start assembling the pie by spreading the ricotta mixture all over the base. Place several slices of fresh mozzarella evenly over the crust. Next, add the cut zucchini and squash and charred red onions. Drizzle with olive oil and place in the oven on the aluminum pan or if using a pizza stone, slide on from the wooden peel. Let bake for about 10 minutes, then slide the pizza right onto the oven rack and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 22866,&quot;Dill Mayonnaise 1 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon dill, fresh, minced Salt Pepper Instructions: Mix thoroughly in a bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22867,&quot;Jellied Cranberry-Cherry Sauce 1 pound cranberries (fresh or frozen) 2 cups sugar 1/2 cup tart cherry juice 1/2 cup dried cherries 1 sprig rosemary Kosher salt Instructions: Combine the cranberries, sugar, 1 1/2 cups water, the cherry juice, dried cherries, rosemary and a pinch of salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the sauce thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly. Discard the rosemary sprig. Puree the sauce in a blender until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a serving dish, pressing the sauce through with a rubber spatula. Refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Sparkling wine]&quot; 22868,&quot;Breakfast Nachos 8 homemade or thawed frozen waffles, cut into triangles (like tortilla chips) 1 pound breakfast sausage, casings removed and meat crumbled 1 tablespoon olive oil 6 large eggs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon maple syrup<br> 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar 1 avocado, thinly sliced<br> 1/2 cup quartered cherry tomatoes<br> 3 scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced<br> 1 jalapeno, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> Hot sauce, for serving, optional Sour cream, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Meanwhile, scrub the parsnips to remove any excess dirt. Lay the parsnip flat on a cutting board, and using a vegetable peeler, peel off 4 to 5 flat, wide noodle-shaped strips. Rotate the parsnip 90 degrees and repeat. Continue to rotate until you can no longer peel strips. Repeat with the remaining parsnips. Gently add a small handful of parsnips to the oil, stirring gently, until lightly browned and crisp, approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the crisps from the oil using a spider or slotted spoon; hold over the pot and allow to drain for 30 seconds. Transfer to a cooling rack set over a half sheet pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper, if desired. After the first batch, the oil temperature may drop. Adjust the heat in order to maintain a minimum temperature of 325 to 350 degrees F. Repeat until all parsnips are cooked. Serve warm or at room temperature. Once completely cooled, store in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 22871,&quot;Chicken Etouffee 1 chicken, about 3 1/2 pounds, quartered Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup vegetable oil 2 medium onions, in large dice 2 medium bell peppers, in large dice 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded, stemmed, and minced 15 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced 2 teaspoons dried thyme 2 teaspoons dried sage 3 cups water Hot sauce to taste Instructions: Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and dust them with some of the flour. Place the oil in a large, heavy-gauge stockpot and bring it to the smoking point over high heat. Add the chicken, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the pieces are brown on one side. Turn the pieces and repeat on the other side. Remove the chicken from the pot. Return the oil to the smoking point, add the onions, peppers, and garlic to the pot, and stir. Cover and let cook for about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally and taking care not to let the vegetables burn. Add the remaining flour and saute for 5 minutes, scraping the bottom and sides of the pot with a wooden spoon. Be careful not to burn the mixture, but allow it to turn dark brown, take on a nutty aroma, and dry out. Add the thyme and sage, adjust the salt and pepper, and gradually add the water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps and burning. When everything is well mixed, return the chicken to the pot, bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and almost falling off the bones.

Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles a coarse meal. Add the egg mixture and stir the dough together with a fork until it is fully moistened and crumbly. Knead the dough a few times until it comes together. If the dough is dry, stir in up to 1 tablespoon cold water. Form the dough into 2 disks, about 11 ounces each, then wrap them in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the filling: Meanwhile, peel, halve and core the pears. Cut each half into 4 wedges, and cut the wedges in half crosswise to shorten them. Toss with the sugar, cinnamon, salt and 1/4 cup bourbon. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the pan from the heat, add the pears, return to the heat and cook until the sugar dissolves and the pears begin to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pears are tender when pierced with a knife, 3 to 6 minutes. Strain the pears into a bowl to catch the juices. Put the juices back into the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until caramelized and syrupy, about 2 minutes. Pour the syrup over the pears and chill until cooled. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place an inverted baking sheet on the bottom rack. Line another baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll each disk of dough to a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Fit one into a 9-inch pie pan and trim to a 1/2-inch overhang, then brush the edges with the beaten egg. Fold the edge of the dough underneath and press to seal and crimp. From the second dough circle, cut out stars with 1 1/2-inch, 2-inch and 3 1/2-inch star cutters and place them on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the cutouts with the beaten egg. Sprinkle gold sanding sugar over some, but not all, of the stars. Chill the stars and the crust in the freezer for 15 minutes. Stir the cornstarch and the remaining 2 tablespoons bourbon, if using, into the cooled pear filling, and pour the filling into the crust. Lay the stars on top of the filling, some of them overlapping, so that most of the pie is covered but some of the filling is peeking out. Place the pie on another baking sheet. Bake the pie on top of the inverted baking sheet until the crust is light golden brown, the pears are tender and the filling is bubbly, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. (If the crust gets too brown, tent it with aluminum foil.) Let the pie cool 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 22881,&quot;Chicken in a Sack 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> 12 ounces haricots verts<br> 2 cups cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes, halved<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 3 tablespoons fresh tarragon 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> 3 large shallots, thinly sliced<br> White wine<br> 4 tablespoons butter<br> 2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves, chopped<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly pound the chicken breasts. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. In a bowl combine the haricots verts, tomatoes, olive oil, tarragon, garlic, shallots and some salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Cut four 12-by-16-inch pieces of parchment paper.* Arrange one-quarter of the bean mixture in the center of each parchment, add a splash of white wine, and top with a chicken breast, 1 tablespoon of the butter and one-quarter of the chopped parsley. Meet the short ends at the middle and fold over 1 inch. Fold a few more turns, then fold in the ends to make half-moon shaped packets (sacks). Repeat for the remaining beans, pieces of chicken and parchment paper. Roast the chicken 25 to 30 minutes and remove from the oven. Serve the chicken packets on plates, then open the parcels carefully and slide the contents out. Discard the paper before eating. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 22882,&quot;Chocolate and Cinnamon Mousse 8 ounces dark chocolate, grated or crushed 1 cup whipping cream 1/2 teaspoon powdered cinnamon 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder Instructions: Place grated chocolate in bowl.

Cut 2 or 3 slits into whole eggplant. Place eggplant directly on the oven rack in the middle of the oven and roast the eggplant until it is tender, about 20 minutes. Keep the slits facing up so that the eggplant does not loose liquids as it roasts. The roasted eggplant will look like a flat tire when you remove it from the oven. Using a sharp utility knife, carefully peel skin away from eggplant flesh. Add cooked eggplant flesh and juice to food processor and combine with garlic, allspice, salt, and pepper and parsley. Pulse grind the eggplant into a paste, add a drizzle of olive oil. Transfer to a serving dish. The seeds of the eggplant will make the spread resemble caviar eggs, and so the name: poor man&#39;s caviar. To serve, surround a bowlful of spread with crusty bread rounds. Tidbit: Mixed olives and selections of Italian sheep&#39;s milk cheeses are suggested accompaniments to this menu to round out your buffet. They require no recipe or preparation and add something to the offering overall. Place them on the buffet near the eggplant caviar and bread. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]</p><p>&quot; 22885,&quot;Ham Gravy Ham cooking juices 1 stick butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, more or less to taste 4 to 6 cups whole milk Salt and ground pepper Biscuits, for serving Instructions: Into the pan that the ham was cooked in (or use bacon grease if you don&#39;t have ham juices), add the butter. Once melted, add 1/4 cup of the flour and whisk to combine. Continue adding flour, whisking constantly, until a smooth paste is achieved. Cook the roux over a medium heat until you get a nice deep golden color, about 3 minutes. Add the milk, whisking the whole time to prevent lumps forming. Cook until thick and season to taste.

Strain the puree through a sieve into a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer the chilled puree into a wide, shallow, heavy-bottomed container. (The shallower and wider the container, the more room you give the granita to freeze quickly.) Cover with foil or plastic wrap and freeze until it begins to appear solid around the edges, about 1 hour. Using a fork, scrape the ice from sides, mixing in from the edges into the center. Repeat this scraping and mixing process every 30 minutes, until the entire mixture has the consistency of shaved ice. Put back in freezer until ready to use. Chopped salad: Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Shrimp: Combine the cilantro, lime zest and juice, jalapeno and olive oil in a blender or food processor. Set aside. If using a gas grill, preheat the grill to high, direct heat. If using coals, allow the coals to burn down to glowing white embers. The grill is hot enough when you can hold your hand about 1-inch over it for only 1 second. Lightly grease the grill with olive oil to prevent sticking. Lightly salt the shrimp and thread each skewer with 3 shrimp. Grill shrimp approximately 2 minutes per side, basting with cilantro oil twice. Remove the shrimp from the grill and add the remaining cilantro oil to a small pan. Heat the oil until bubbling. Add the avocado to a small bowl and drizzle with lime juice. To serve, spoon some of the chopped salad on each serving plate and top with some granita. Add a few teaspoons of avocado, a skewer of shrimp and a drizzle of the hot cilantro oil.

If using charcoal, the coals should be placed so that they are under half of the rack, creating 2 zones: 1 hot and 1 mildly hot. If using a gas grill, follow manufacturer&#39;s instructions to create zones for both direct and indirect grilling. When the grill is hot, clean it with a wire brush. It does not need to be oiled at this time. To make the honey plum sauce, combine the plums, honey, garlic, ginger, rice wine vinegar, hoisin sauce, and dried pepper flakes in a fireproof saucepan and place on the grill over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and then place the saucepan to the side of the grill with indirect heat and simmer, covered, for 15 to 30 minutes, until the plums are completely cooked. Place the mixture in the bowl of a food processor or blender and puree until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Add more of any specific ingredient you feel necessary (e.g., honey, hoisin sauce). To make the patties, remove the skin from the duck breasts. Place the duck breasts and 1 of the skins in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until well combined. Transfer the duck mixture to a large bowl. Add scallions, cilantro, five-spice powder, salt and pepper to the bowl. Handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting it, mix well. Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions and form the portions into patties to fit the onion rolls. Brush the grill rack with vegetable oil. Place the patties on the rack, cover, and cook, turning once, just until done, about 3 minutes on each side. During the last few minutes of cooking, place the onion rolls, cut side down, on the outer edges of the rack to toast lightly. To assemble the burgers, place a generous amount of the honey plum sauce on the cut side of the onion rolls. On the onion roll bottoms, place a patty and an equal amount of napa cabbage. Add the onion roll tops and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 22891,&quot;Collard Greens 2 ham hocks 1 large onion 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 mashed garlic cloves, smashed 1 quart water 6 bunches collard greens, cleaned Instructions: In a large pot combine the ham hock, onion, extra-virgin olive oil, and smashed garlic. Add the water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 1 hour. Gradually add the collard greens to the stock pot.

Grease a Bundt pan with butter. First prepare the cake batter. Add the butter and sugar to a bowl and, using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer, beat until light and fluffy. Then beat in 1 egg. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Mix the buttermilk, cocoa powder, tequila, triple sec and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Beat half of the flour mixture half of the buttermilk into the egg mixture. Repeat, ending with the flour mixture. Blend until well incorporated. Now prepare the flan mixture. In a blender, combine the condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream cheese, the remaining 3 eggs and vanilla extract. Blend on high for 30 seconds. Scoop the cake batter into the prepared Bundt pan. Then slowly pour the flan mixture over the cake batter. Add about 1-inch of hot water to the roasting pan. Carefully slide the pan into the oven and bake until the surface of the cake is firm to the touch, or an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 1 hour. When the cake is done, remove from the water bath and cool completely to room temperature, about 1 hour. Run the tip of a sharp paring knife along the edge of the Bundt pan to loosen. Invert a large, rimmed serving platter over the Bundt pan, grasp tightly together, jiggle it a little and flip over to release the chocoflan from the pan. Garnish the cake with some chopped pecans.

To assemble the spiders: Using the tip of a paring knife, make 3 holes on each side of the truffles, big enough to inset a pretzel into. Break off the curved portions of the pretzels (so you have shapes that look like the letter \\J). You should have 6 J-shaped pretzel pieces per truffle; these will be the legs. (The legs do not have to perfectly even, but try to get them close to the same size.) Line a plate with parchment paper. Dip the curved end of a pretzel piece into the melted chocolate and then insert into a hole in a truffle with the curve going down towards the bottom of the truffle; repeat with 5 more pretzel pieces and the melted chocolate. Lay the spider on the prepared plate with the legs up. Repeat with the remaining truffles, melted chocolate and pretzels. Refrigerate or freeze until set, about 10 minutes. Flip the spiders over so they are standing on their pretzel legs. Using the melted chocolate, make 2 dots on each truffle for eyes. Stick the desired candies on the melted chocolate.

Fill each pumpkin cavity with the chocolate and allow it to set. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When set, the pumpkin candies should pop out of the mold. You can serve them as they are or you can sandwich 2 together. To sandwich them together, pipe a little of the white chocolate on the back of 1 piece and press another candy back-to-back. Let the chocolate harden. Make the pumpkin candy dish: Place some powdered orange food color in a small bowl. Add a few tablespoons of cocoa butter to the food color and stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush (or a clean pastry brush used only for food, not for paint) to paint the inside of the mold (top and bottom) with the color. Make sure the inside is completely coated. You can use a hairdryer to warm up the cocoa butter paint if it begins to cool. Place the mold in the refrigerator for a few minutes until the cocoa butter sets. Use a cornet filled with bittersweet chocolate to pipe the chocolate into the stem at the top of the mold. Allow the chocolate to set. When the painted mold has set, use a ladle to completely fill each piece (the top and the bottom) of the mold with white chocolate. Tap the mold on the counter to encourage the air bubbles to depart. When the mold is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Scrape the mold clean with an offset spatula and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. It may be necessary to give each mold more than one coat. This will make the candy dish stronger. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a chef&#39;s knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with as many molds as you would like to make. Unmold the pumpkin candy dish. It should pop out of the mold. Fill the bottom of the mold with pumpkin candies. Place the top of the mold in place. Whenever I use cocoa butter mixed with food color, I like to use an electric yogurt maker. The yogurt maker will keep the cocoa butter melted.

Juice of 1 lime Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 6 to 8 ounces nduja (soft Italian salami; available at boccalone.com) 1 8-to-10-ounce bag white corn tortilla chips 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced 2 cups canned pinto beans, drained and rinsed Finely grated zest of 1 lime 12 radishes, thinly sliced 1 cup queso fresco 1 cup fresh corn kernels 2 tablespoons pickled jalapeno slices, drained, or more to taste 2 hass avocados 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Make the salsa: Roughly chop the tomatoes, onion and cl pepper and transfer to a food processor. Add the cilantro and beer and blend until chunky-smooth. Add the lime juice, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Make the nachos: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Render the nduja by sauteing it in a skillet over medium heat to give it a loose, spoonable consistency, 3 to 4 minutes. Toss the tortilla chips with the scallions, beans, lime zest, radishes, 1/2 cup queso fresco, the corn and pickled jalapenos in a large bowl. Add the rendered nduja and mix well. Place in a nonreactive casserole dish, then top with the remaining 1/2 cup queso fresco. Bake until the nachos are heated through (the cheese will not melt completely), about 10 minutes. Spoon some of the salsa on top of the nachos (reserve the rest for dipping). Slice the avocados in half, remove the pits and dice inside the skin. Scoop out the avocado pieces and drop them on the top of the nachos along with the cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 22919,&quot;Hibiscus Tea with Vodka and Citrus 4 cups water 2 cups (2 ounces) dried hibiscus flowers or dried rose petals* 1 3/4 cups sugar 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 cup vodka, chilled 1 cup ice Instructions: *Can be found at specialty Latin markets In a medium saucepan, combine the water, hibiscus flowers, and sugar over medium-high heat.

Toss to coat, then set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature. For the sauce: Meanwhile, combine the gochujang, sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, sesame oil, gochugaru, garlic and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the sauce is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the rice vinegar. Set the sauce aside.<br> For the batter: Fill a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with 3 to 4 inches of oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F.<br> Whisk the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, curry powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups cold water and whisk until the batter is smooth and very thin (about the consistency of half-and-half). If needed, add more cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin the batter.<br> Remove about a third of the chicken wings from the soju marinade and dip in the batter, letting any excess drip off. Then, using tongs, hold the chicken halfway in the hot oil for 1 to 2 seconds before letting go completely, as this prevents the wings from sticking to the bottom. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a temperature between 300 and 325 degrees F. Stir occasionally to prevent the wings from sticking. Fry the wings until the coating is crisp but not browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove to a rack set on a baking sheet to drain. Let the oil temperature return to 350 degrees F. Dredge and fry the remaining chicken wings in 2 batches.<br> Remove any floating debris and cooked batter from the oil with a hand-held strainer. Increase the oil temperature to 375 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the chicken again until the coating is browned and very crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature above 350 degrees F. Remove the wings with tongs and transfer to a clean rack set on a baking sheet. Let stand for 1 minute to allow the coating to set. Brush all over with the sauce.

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Stir in the brown sugar along with the cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt, then cook, stirring, until the sugar is melted and begins to bubble, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let it cool slightly. Arrange the peaches in the bottom of the skillet, fanning out in a circular pattern. Set aside. Whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or using a hand mixer, beat the remaining 9 tablespoons butter together with the granulated sugar on high speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. On low speed, add half the dry ingredients, half the milk, the remaining dry ingredients, then the remaining milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat just until everything is well mixed, scraping down the bowl once. (Use a spatula to be sure there are no dry ingredients stuck to the bottom of the bowl.) Drop the batter in large dollops over the peaches in the skillet, then use an offset spatula to gently smooth it out, being careful not to disturb the peaches. Bake until the top is golden brown and puffed and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool for 20 minutes.

Process until finely ground, about 1 minute. With the processor running, slowly pour in the butter. Process the mixture until it is the texture of coarse sand, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to an 8-inch springform pan. Using a measuring cup, press the crust into the bottom and about 2 1/2 inches up the sides of the springform pan. Press firmly to pack and make an evenly thick crust. Place in the freezer for 20 minutes. For the filling: In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until softened and smooth, about a minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the granulated sugar; beat to combine. Add the sour cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and apple pie spice. Beat to combine until very smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. In a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream and vanilla extract with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Add a third of the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture and gently fold in with a rubber spatula until completely combined. (Scoop the mixture from the bottom of the bowl and fold over the top to combine the mixture, without letting all of the air out of the whipped cream). Add the remaining two-thirds of the whipped cream and continue to gently fold until completely combined. Remove the crust from the freezer and add the filling. Gently push into an even layer and smooth the top with the back of a spoon. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to overnight. Loosen the cheesecake from the springform pan by running a knife along the edge, then opening the clasp.

Add the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic puree; cook for 3 minutes, until vegetables are soft. Mix in the potatoes, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and bay leaf, and stir continuously for 2 to 3 minutes, until potatoes begin to soften and spices are aromatic. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf. Puree the soup using a hand-held immersion blender, or blend in several batches in a blender. (If using a standard blender, place a folded dish towel over the top to prevent hot liquid from splashing out.) Pulse on and off until the soup is smoothly pureed. Return the soup to the saucepan and whisk in the cream, brown sugar, molasses, salt, and pepper. Serve hot. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place the garlic in a small, ovenproof container and pour in the oil. Use additional oil if needed to completely immerse all the garlic cloves. Cover the container with aluminum foil and roast 1 hour, until garlic is soft and light golden brown. Strain the garlic and place in a blender along with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Puree to a smooth consistency, adding a small amount of oil if necessary. Pour into a container and cover the top of the puree with a thin layer of the oil.

In a big bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar together with a wooden spoon or a hand mixer. Mix in the molasses and egg until smooth, then add the flour mixture and mix until well combined. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Freeze it flat on a baking sheet for 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly spray the paper with cooking spray. Use your preferred cookie cutters to stamp out shapes (or use a paring knife and architect the gingerbread home of your dreams), then transfer the shapes to the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the dough no longer looks shiny, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool on the sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. For the royal icing: Using a stand mixer and the whisk attachment, whip most of the powdered sugar with the egg whites and most of the lemon juice. Whip until the icing holds its shape and is bright white (not translucent), 5 to 8 minutes. If it is too soft, add more powdered sugar. If it is too stiff, add a bit more lemon juice, drop by drop. If you are using color, add a few drops of it at this point and keep whipping until you have a shade you want. Pipe the royal icing onto the cooled cookies to decorate. To store royal icing: The ideal way is to scrape it out of the bowl and into a plastic, disposable piping bag, then leave it at room temperature. Don&#39;t cut the bag until you&#39;re ready to use the royal icing and don&#39;t overfill the bag--you want enough room to tie the back of the bag off to keep the icing airtight. If any air comes into contact with the icing, it gets hard and that part of the icing is useless. Never attempt to mix hard bits back into the royal icing--you&#39;ll ruin the whole batch. The other accepted method of storing the icing is to scrape it into a plastic or ceramic bowl, and cover it with a wet paper towel. This method works, but it wastes both paper towels and royal icing. It&#39;s also just annoying. When you&#39;re piping small designs, you want to use very small parchment piping bags. It&#39;s easy to stick the nose of a large piping bag into a small one and extract exactly how much you need. When the icing is in a bowl, you have to use a spoon to get it out. The spoon is difficult to get into a piping bag, and you keep using spoons and wasting royal icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 22934,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Churros 1 stick unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 limes 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 3 large eggs<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 1/2 cup sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Instructions: Make the dough: Combine the butter with 1 cup water and the salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat; grate in the zest of 1 lime. Let the butter melt, then bring the mixture to a simmer and slowly whisk in the flour. Remove from the heat and keep whisking until the dough forms a ball and pulls away from the side of the pan. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, mixing each in completely before adding the next. Fry the churros: Fit a pastry bag with a medium open star tip.

The refreshing peppermint counterpoint takes the edge off the intense fudge-like cake. To facilitate cutting the Peppermint Patties, I often freeze them first. Use a hot, dry long-bladed knife to cut perfectly clean slices of the cake. Serve with whipped cream, cocoa fudge sauce, and a drizzle of mint syrup. Cocoa Fudge Sauce, recipe follows, for serving Mint Syrup, recipe follows, for serving To make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 1/2 to 10-inch springform pan, line the bottom with parchment paper, butter the paper, and flour the pan, tapping out the excess flour. Melt the chocolate with the butter and cream in the top of a double boiler. Reserve. In the bowl of a mixer with a whip, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until very thick and light (about 5 minutes). Add the melted chocolate mixture to the egg yolks and mix until just blended. Add the flour, salt, and vanilla and mix until combined, scraping the bowl once or twice. Transfer the batter to a large mixing bowl and stir in the Peppermint Pattie pieces. The mixture will be quite thick. In a clean mixing bowl, with a clean whip, beat the egg whites to medium soft peaks. Lighten the batter by stirring in about one-third of the egg whites. Fold in the remaining whites and the place batter in the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for approximately 45 to 50 minutes. The top of the cake will feel set and very fine hairline cracks will just start to form around the edges. Remove and cool in the pan on a rack. To make the ganache topping: Heat the cream in a heavy bottomed saucepan to just under a boil. Add the chopped chocolate and, over very low heat, constantly stirring, cook the mixture until it is completely smooth. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until thickened and spreadable. This can take several hours. You can make the topping up to 3 days ahead, refrigerate it, and allow it to come to room temperature for several hours before using. You can also hasten the cooling process by placing the melted ganache over an ice bath and gently stirring it till thickened; however, the resulting texture may not be quite as smooth and creamy. Place the cooled cake upside down on a cardboard cake circle or a service plate. Remove the sides and bottom of the springform pan. Remove the parchment liner. Using an offset spatula, decoratively spread the ganache over what is now the top of the cake, drawing the ganache all the way out to the edges of the cake. Using the offset spatula, level the edges to give the cake a finished look. Serve at room temperature with whipped cream, Cocoa Fudge Sauce and Mint Syrup. Melt the butter in a medium sized saucepan. Whisk in the sugar and cocoa. Whisk in the cream and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium low heat, whisking often. Allow to simmer for 8 to 10 minutes until the sauce has thickened somewhat. Remove from heat, add the vanilla and strain though a fine sieve. Cool and serve at room temperature. This can be made up to 1 week ahead of time. It can also be frozen. Yield: 2 cups Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Turn the heat down and simmer several minutes, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from heat and cool completely. Reserve. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Have a strainer and a bowl of ice water at the ready. Working quickly, place the mint leaves in the boiling water and blanch until just wilted (about 10 seconds). Immediately strain the mint and place the leaves directly in the ice water to set their color. Strain the mint again, pressing to remove excess liquid. Place the mint leaves and half of the reserved syrup in a blender. Puree the mint, stopping several times to scrape down the blender bowl. Add the remaining syrup and blend for 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a clean storage container and allow to sit overnight, covered, at room temperature. Strain the syrup through a fine mesh strainer and discard the solid mint puree. Store the syrup, refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks. Shake or stir lightly before using.

Butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins and sprinkle with Parmesan to lightly coat, tapping out excess. Put prepared ramekins on a baking sheet and refrigerate. To make the souffle base: Put the milk, thyme, and bay leaf in a microwave-safe measuring cup and microwave on HIGH until steaming, about 2 minutes. (Or, bring the milk and herbs just to a simmer in a small saucepan on the stove, and then pull from the heat.) Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture (roux) lightens and foams, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the warm milk, bring to a boil, and cook, whisking constantly, until the souffle base thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Remove the herbs. Transfer the base to a large bowl and whisk to cool. Add the egg yolks, the Parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, cayenne, and nutmeg. Slowly whisk the egg whites in a very clean bowl with lemon juice, and pinch of salt with a hand-held mixer until foamy. Increase the speed to high and whip until the whites hold a soft peak. Quickly, but gently fold 1/4 of the whites into the base with a rubber spatula. Fold in the remaining whites just until streaky, then scatter the grated cheese on top and fold everything together, taking care not to overmix. Divide the batter among the prepared ramekins, and bake until golden, puffed, and just set in the center, about 30 minutes. Using an oven mitt or towel, transfer the ramekins to individual plates and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 22958,&quot;Buttermilk Scones 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more fordusting 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 2 tablespoons dry buttermilk powder (available in the baking aisle) 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary (optional) 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (optional) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream 2 tablespoons coarse brown sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Take the pan off the heat, add the lemongrass and let it infuse for about half an hour. Strain the syrup into a measuring cup, keeping the saucepan with the lemongrass to 1 side. Take out about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the syrup and put it into a pan with the raspberries. Bring it to a rolling boil and let it thicken slightly, mashing the fruit to make a jam-like consistency. Let it cool a little and then dunk the ladyfingers in the raspberry mixture and arrange them in the bottom of your bowl. Add the vodka and about 1/2 cup of the lemongrass syrup, depending on how much your ladyfingers absorb, and reserve the rest. Meanwhile, to make the custard, heat the light cream in the syrup pan with the lemongrass until it is nearly boiling, take it off the heat and let it infuse for about 15 minutes. Strain into a bowl. Whisk the yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar together and pour into the cream in the bowl. Then whisk again and put the custard back on the heat in the cleaned-out pan. Stir until the custard thickens and then pour it over the trifle sponges. Let it cool. Whip the heavy cream until thick but not stiff, and cover the custard layer.

Lay 2 sheets of aluminum foil, about 14 inches long, on top of each other and crimp the edges together and up slightly so it resembles a rimmed baking sheet. Put the beans in the center and toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the foil baking sheet on the grill and add 2 tablespoons water. Grill the beans, tossing with long tongs occasionally, until lightly charred and softened, about 10 minutes. Add the onions and another 2 tablespoons of water and continue to grill until the beans and onions are tender, another 6 to 7 minutes. While the beans grill, cook the bacon in a small skillet over medium heat until crispy; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Pour off the bacon drippings, leaving about a tablespoon in the skillet. Remove the skillet from the heat and immediately stir in the mustard, vinegar and remaining 1 tablespoon oil until combined. Transfer the beans and onions to a bowl and add the vinaigrette from the skillet. Toss well, crumble the bacon over top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 23000,&quot;Garlic Cheese Bread Sticks 1 stick butter 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 loaf French bread, cut in half lengthways<br> Two 6-ounce balls fresh mozzarella, sliced<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Set an oven rack on the bottom position and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Put the bread onto a baking sheet and cook on the bottom rack for about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23001,&quot;Gnocchi and Tomato Pancetta Sauce 2 large russet (baking potatoes) 3-4 cups flour Olive oil 8 slices thick (bacon thickness) pancetta, chopped 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes, depending on you desire for spice 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley, chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried parsley) 2 to 3 cloves chopped garlic 2 (28-ounce) cans whole Italian plum tomatoes Salt Instructions: Boil the potatoes until fork tender (not mushy). As soon as they are done, remove from the water and place in a dish. Remove the skin from the potatoes using a sharp knife or fork. Cut the potatoes into pieces and process the peeled, hot potatoes through a food mill using the medium disk. Place a mound of flour, about 2 1/2 cups to start, on your work surface (a floured board). Place all of the processed potatoes on top of the flour. Knead the flour/potato mixture with your hands until the dough is smooth; free of lumps, but yet still a little sticky. This recipe does not lend itself to making the dough in the food processor or mixer. Keep adding flour as necessary to obtain the desired consistency. The amount of the flour needed depends on how much water is in the potatoes, the moisture in the air, etc. Sometimes it can take up to 4 cups to obtain the right consistency. Keep kneading until it is right. After kneading the dough, place it under a dry kitchen towel to keep it warm. Immediately start making the gnocchi. This dough must be used right away. Cut a small piece off of the dough. Roll the piece into a \\log\\ that is approximately 12 to 16 inches long. The log should be about 1/2-inch in diameter. You do not want it too wide or the gnocchi get too \\fat.\\ Cut the \\log\\ into pieces about 1-inch long. You will end up with about 12 to16 gnocchi per log. The next step is to form the gnocchi. Take a fork in your left hand (if you are right handed), and hold it straight up with the tines facing towards the ceiling. With your index finger of your right hand, take 1 piece of gnocchi (the 1-inch pieces that you cut above), and starting at the top of the fork, roll the piece down the inside tine of the fork. This should be done with firm pressure (not too firm as to smash the gnocchi, but firm enough to roll the piece down the fork and leave an indentation on the gnocchi). When you get to the base of the tines, release the gnocchi and let it drop to a floured tray. The \\completed\\ gnocchi should be marked with the fork tines on 1 side of it and have a slight indentation from your index finger on the other side of it. This shape and marking allow the pasta to \\catch\\ the sauce when you serve it. Proceed with all of the dough and make each piece as directed. This goes very fast once you get the hang of it. Let the pasta sit on the floured trays on you counter until ready to serve. However, serving time should be within 4 to 5 hours of making the gnocchi. Otherwise they will dry out and get tough. To serve, boil the gnocchi in lots of boiling, salted water. As soon as the pasta rises to the top, it is done. (This is also very quick). Drain the cooked gnocchi in a colander or strainer. Place the cooked pasta in a serving platter and top/mix with the sauce. Heat olive oil in saucepan over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Add the chopped pancetta, red pepper flakes and parsley. Cook until the pancetta is cooked through and is slightly brown. Add the garlic; cook for another 2 minutes. Process the tomatoes with their juice in the food processor. Pulse the tomatoes briefly until they are coarsely chopped. You do not want them to puree. Add to the cooked ingredients in the saucepan. Add salt to taste. Continue cooking on a low simmer for about 1 hour until the sauce has reduced and is somewhat thicker. You can keep cooking this for up to 3 hours. The longer you cook it, the thicker and richer it becomes. If you cook it too long, add water to reduce the thickness and you reach the desired consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 23002,&quot;Chopped Cheeseburgers 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 onion, finely chopped 1 1/4 pounds ground beef, broken into pieces<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 to 4 tablespoons chopped pickled hot peppers<br> 8 slices American cheese (about 4 ounces)<br> 1/3 cup mayonnaise<br> 4 soft white hero rolls, split and toasted<br> Shredded iceberg lettuce, sliced tomatoes, ketchup and hot sauce, for topping Shredded iceberg lettuce, sliced tomatoes, ketchup and hot sauce, for topping<br> Potato chips, for serving Instructions: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.

Don&#39;t waste pods, you can place them in the stock after the peas are cooked to infuse their fantastic delicate flavor. Use this stock as part of the stock/water for the risotto. At the end of Stage 3 in the basic risotto recipe, add the prawns and peas and simmer for 1 minute as prawns take no time to cook. At Stage 4 of the risotto recipe throw in the fresh herbs and squeeze the lemon juice. Stir and serve immediately. Drizzle with good peppery olive oil.; Stage 1. Heat stock. In a separate pan heat the olive oil, add the shallots or onion, garlic and celery and slowly fry for about 3 minutes. When the vegetables have softened, add the rice, season with salt and pepper and turn up the heat. Stage 2. The rice will now begin to fry, so keep stirring it. After a minute it will look slightly translucent having absorbed all the flavors from the vegetables. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring -- it will smell fantastic as it sizzles around the rice. Any harsh alcohol flavors will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence. Stage 3. Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of salt. Turn down the heat to a highish simmer so the rice doesn&#39;t cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladles of stock, stirring and allowing each ladle of liquid to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes. Taste the rice -- is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don&#39;t forget to carefully check the seasoning. Stage 4. Remove from the heat and add the butter and Parmesan, if using. Stir gently. Place lid on pan and allow to sit for 2 to 3 minutes. This is the most important part of making the risotto as this is when it becomes outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat as soon as possible while the risotto retains its perfect texture.

Make the filling: In the bowl of a food processor add the shrimp, 1/2 bunch basil leaves, 1/2 bunch chives, 1/2 bunch chervil, egg white, and 2 tablespoons olive oil; season this with salt and pepper. Pulse until it is finely chopped but not pureed. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Roll out the dough: Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine set at the widest setting 2 or 3 times. Guide the dough with your hand as it emerges from the rollers to prevent it from puncturing or stretching. Dust the sheets with extra flour whenever the dough gets sticky. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times. Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick for ravioli. Roll out the other half. Form the ravioli: Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter with flour, lay out 1 long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash. Drop the filling by the tablespoonful about 2-inches apart onto 1/2 of the pasta sheet. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. Gently press out the air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut the sides around each mound and press the edges with your fingers to make a tight seal. Dust a sheet pan with flour to prevent the ravioli from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest. Make the sauce: Heat the broiler. Put the tomatoes onto a baking sheet, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Broil until the tomatoes burst, about 10 minutes. In a large skillet over medium-high heat add the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil. Put in the shallots and cook them until they are soft, about 5 minutes. Chop the remaining basil, chives, and chervil and add them to the pan. Fold the tomatoes into the pan and cook for another 5 minutes; keep warm while you cook the ravioli. Cook and sauce the ravioli: Place the pasta into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook for about 4 minutes, they&#39;ll float to the top when ready; do not overcrowd the pot. Lift them from the water with a large strainer or slotted spoon into the tomato sauce. Gently coat the ravioli with the sauce and serve garnished with more chopped herbs. To make the pasta dough: In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix. Pour in 1 tablespoon olive oil and continue to mix until a smooth dough is formed. If the dough is too dry drizzle in a bit of water, if it is too wet sprinkle in some more flour. Dust some flour on a work surface, knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. To make the dough by hand: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface, shape into a mound, and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall and mix it with the beaten eggs. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a smooth dough. Dust some flour on the work surface; knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. To roll out the dough: Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour.

If using a charcoal grill, stack the unlit charcoals around the perimeter of the grill, about halfway, then light the first few at one end so the snake begins to burn slowly. (This results in a controlled 325 to 350 degrees F heat.) If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Toss the potatoes with 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large bowl. Season well with salt and pepper. Lay out 2 sheets of aluminum foil in a cross and place the potatoes in the middle. Gather up the sides to create a foil packet, add 2 tablespoons of water and seal the foil packet. Place the foil packet over direct heat and steam until the potatoes are cooked through, about 30 minutes. Open the foil packet and continue to cook until the potatoes take on some smoke and dry out, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the peanuts, remaining 1/4 cup oil, vinegar, cilantro, mustard, celery seeds and sugar in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the potatoes from the grill, add to the bowl with the vinaigrette and toss to coat.

Dissolve cornstarch in bourbon and add to pan. Continue to cook for about 3 minutes, stirring. Liquid should thicken, slightly. Remove the meat and onion mixture from the pan and pour the sauce over the top. Serve hors d&#39;oeuvres family style with toothpicks and crackers or French bread slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23037,&quot;Pumpkin Risotto 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup finely chopped onion 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 cups arborio rice 1 cup dry white wine About 6 cups of hot chicken stock or vegetable stock 1 butternut squash, one half baked in the oven and then pureed; the other half, peeled, cut into small dice, and Sauteed in a little oil and butter until tender 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces Instructions: In a medium-size heavy saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute, stirring continuously, just until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rice and continue to stir, using a wooden spoon, to coat the rice with the oil. Add the white wine and continue cooking, stirring often, until it has been absorbed by the rice. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover the rice completely, about 3 cups, and continue to cook, stirring often, until all the liquid is absorbed. Pour in 1 cup more of the remaining stock and stir and cook until it has been absorbed. Repeat with 1 more cup. Add the remaining cup and cook, stirring, until the rice is al dente, tender but still very chewy, and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir in the pumpkin puree and the diced pumpkin and reduce the heat to very low so that the risotto doesn&#39;t simmer anymore. Stir in the Parmesan and butter to give the risotto a nice, creamy finish. Spoon it immediately into heated shallow serving bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 23038,&quot;Caramel Apples 8 apples, any variety 1 cup chopped peanuts or other nut of your choice 1 cup heavy cream, divided 3/4 cup light corn syrup 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Wash and completely dry the apples. Insert a stick into the stem end of each. Line a 9-by-9-inch or 7-by-11-inch baking pan with foil. Place the chopped nuts into the lined pan. Fit a heavy-bottomed saucepan with a candy thermometer. Over high heat, cook 3/4 cup of the cream, the corn syrup, butter, and sugar to 280 degrees F (firm ball); at this point the syrup will be golden. Remove from the heat and carefully swirl in the remaining 1/4 cup of cream and the vanilla. Use caution; this is very hot and it may splatter. While the caramel is hot, dip and turn the apples into the caramel to coat and let the excess drip off. Dip the bottoms into the chopped nuts. Arrange the apples on a nonstick or waxed paper-lined cookie sheet and let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 23039,&quot;Buttermilk Biscuits 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold, plus 1 tablespoon 1 1/2 cups cake flour 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided, plus more for work surface 3 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/4 teaspoons sea salt, divided 2 tablespoons shortening, cold 1 cup buttermilk Instructions: Cut 1/2 cup of the butter into 1/2-inch pieces and refrigerate it along with the shortening. In the bowl of a food processor, fitted with the steel blade, pulse together the cake flour, 3/4 cup of the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt. Add the butter and shortening and pulse to combine, until small crumbles are present. 6 to 8 times, or Add the buttermilk and pulse until a dough ball forms, about 5 to 6 times. Dust a dry work surface with flour and have the remaining 1 cup ready for kneading. Turn the dough out onto the floured work surface. With floured hands, gently press the dough out into an 11 by 8-inch rectangle, about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick, dust lightly with flour and gently fold it over in thirds, like a letter. Roll or press out to a 6 by 6-inch rectangle again about 2 inches thick. Cut the dough into 9 squares (2 by 2 inches each) with a pizza cutter. Transfer the biscuits to a silicone mat or parchment paper lined baking sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let them rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Melt the remaining tablespoon butter and brush tops with melted butter, then sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt. Place baking sheet in the middle of the oven and immediately turn oven down to 450 degrees F. Bake for 12 to 16 minutes until they are golden brown.

Add the linguine and cook according to the package directions for al dente. Be careful not to overcook; the pasta should have plenty of bite to it. Drain and keep warm. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter. (Using both olive oil and butter allows you to heat the mixture at a higher heat before it starts to brown.) Add the clams and garlic and stir together. Cook for 3 minutes. Pour in the white wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Cook until the sauce is reduced and less watery, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and stir to melt. Reduce the heat and squeeze in the lemon juice. Pour in the cream and sprinkle in the parsley. This is a very decadent dish! Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir well and taste for seasoning. Add a splash of reserved clam juice if the sauce needs thinning. Cook over low heat until heated through, about 3 minutes more. Pour the pasta into a serving bowl. Pour on the sauce straight from the skillet, including all the luscious juice, and toss to combine. At this point your kitchen smells like heaven. Top with freshly grated Parmesan and garnish with lemon slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 23041,&quot;Macadamia Nut Cream Pie 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 3 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening 1 3/4 cups whole milk 1/2 cup salted macadamia nuts, finely chopped 2 large eggs, separated 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup cornstarch 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 3 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped 3/4 cup cold heavy cream 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup salted macadamia nuts 2 tablespoons sweetened shredded coconut, toasted Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, coconut and salt in a food processor until the coconut is finely chopped. Add the butter and shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Drizzle in 3 tablespoons ice water and pulse until the dough begins to come together (add more water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, if necessary). Turn out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and pat into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out the dough into an 11-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges with your fingers. Pierce the bottom all over with a fork. Refrigerate the crust until firm, about 15 minutes. Line the crust with foil, then fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the edges are golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue baking until golden all over, 10 to 15 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Heat 1 1/2 cups milk and the macadamia nuts in a medium saucepan over medium heat (do not boil). Whisk the egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, the cornstarch, vanilla and the remaining 1/4 cup milk in a bowl until combined. Gradually whisk half of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, then pour back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and just begins to boil, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the white chocolate until smooth. Transfer the filling to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Once the filling is cool, bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Whisk the egg whites and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a large heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over the pan (do not let the bowl touch the water) and whisk until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warm. Remove the bowl from the pan and beat with a hand mixer until the egg whites are glossy and stiff, about 5 minutes. Fold the beaten egg whites into the filling, then spread in the prepared crust. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight. Just before serving, make the whipped cream for topping: Beat the heavy cream and confectioners&#39; sugar with a mixer until medium peaks form. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe around the edge of the pie. Top with the macadamia nuts and toasted coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23042,&quot;Tea Smoked Salmon and Upland Cress Sandwiches 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/8 cup rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon Chinese vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1/4 cup canola oil 2 cups upland cress (may substitute watercress) 4 slices sour dough bread 8 to 12 slices of tea smoked salmon Salt and black pepper to taste Instructions: In a bowl, whisk together mustard, vinegars and sugar.

Beat in the egg and the brandy. Beat in the salt. Add the flour and beat until blended. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until a soft dough forms. Form the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape the dough pieces into balls. Wrap the dough balls with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes. Working with 1 dough ball at a time, roll the dough ball into a 12-inch diameter round (the dough should be very thin and almost transparent). Using a fluted pastry cutter, trim the edges to form a square shape. Cut the dough into 1-inch strips. Cut each strip in half crosswise to form 5-inch-long strips. Gently stretch the strip gently so that you have enough dough to tie a bow. Repeat with remaining dough strips. Gather the dough scraps, then reroll and cut them to make additional bowtie pastries. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large heavy frying pan over medium heat to 375 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the pastries until they puff and become golden, turning once, about 2 minutes total. Using tongs, transfer the pastries to the paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain the excess oil. While still hot, dust the pastries generously with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. The pastries can be made 2 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23044,&quot;Cheesy Bacon Straws 1/4 cup maple syrup 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes<br> 1/2 orange, juiced<br> 1 pound regular uncured bacon (not thick cut)<br> 1/4 cup finely shredded Cheddar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and fit a baking sheet with a wire rack.

Line up the bacon slices on the wire rack and brush with the hot maple syrup mixture. Sprinkle some cheese on each piece of bacon. With a skewer in hand, fold the end of a piece of bacon in half lengthwise and press the skewer through the end. Do this to 4 pieces of bacon, spreading them out evenly across the skewer, and place the skewer on the baking sheet. Twist the bacon pieces into long spirals so as to create straws. Take another skewer and skewer the bottom of each piece of bacon to keep the bacon twisted. Do this to all the bacon. Bake until the bacon browns, about 35 minutes. Let cool slightly on the rack; the bacon will get crunchy as it sits. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 23045,&quot;Online Round 2 Recipe - Turkey Soup Reserved turkey, legs, wings and thighs from Roasted Turkey Breast with Spicy Herb Oil 3 sprigs fresh thyme 2 bay leaves Kosher salt 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 medium onion, chopped 2 stalks celery, chopped 1 carrot, chopped 1 parsnip, cut in half and sliced Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: In a large pot over high heat, add the turkey parts and cover with 4 quarts water.

Loosely cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the ricotta for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position a rack in the center of the oven. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna sheets and stir with a large slotted spoon to ensure that the pasta does not stick as it cooks. Cook until still quite firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the pasta and transfer to a large bowl (you&#39;ll use the empty pot later). Gently toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to coat. (This is more pasta than you will need, but the extra noodles are backups for any that might break.) In a large saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the spinach, then sprinkle with salt and cook, stirring, just long enough to wilt, 30 to 45 seconds. Quickly remove the pan from the heat and transfer the spinach to a kitchen towel-lined plate to drain and cool. Return the medium pot to medium heat, then add the cream and garlic and bring to a gentle simmer, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the Worcestershire, hot sauce and 1/2 cup pecorino. Spoon enough of the sauce to lightly coat the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and set aside. In a large bowl, spread the ricotta out on the bottom and up the sides of the bowl (so the seasoning coats most of the cheese). Add the egg and sprinkle with salt. Mix to combine. Add pepper, the lemon zest, lemon juice, tarragon and the remaining 1/2 cup pecorino. Mix to combine. Add the sauteed spinach, reserving some for garnish. Add the allspice and combine thoroughly. Arrange the lasagna sheets on a clean, flat surface with the longer sides of the rectangles facing you. Place about 3 tablespoons ricotta on the edge of the sheet closest to you, leaving a little room on either end. Gently roll the pasta up into a tube away from you and place inside the prepared baking dish, seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling, taking care that the manicotti are snug in the baking dish. Cover the manicotti with about three-quarters of the sauce. (Keep the remaining sauce warm.) Place the baking dish on the center rack of the oven and bake until lightly browned and the filling is hot in the center when pierced with the tip of a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Warm the remaining sauce and spoon it over the manicotti. Sprinkle the top with the reserved spinach and freshly grated Pecorino-Romano.

Add the olive oil and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Pour in the red wine and cook for 1 minute to reduce. Using your hands or a potato masher, crush the tomatoes and add to the saucepot, including any juices from the can. Stir to combine. Add 1 whole stem of fresh basil leaves. Bring the sauce to a simmer and reduce the heat to medium low. Allow the sauce to continuing cooking while the rest of the components are prepared. Pour the vegetable oil into a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot and attach a deep-frying thermometer. Heat the oil over medium heat to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and top with a cooling rack. Set up 3 low-sided dishes to make a breading station: To the first dish, add the flour, Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and stir to combine. In the second dish, beat the eggs. To the third dish, add the breadcrumbs. Dredge both sides of the eggplant slices in the seasoned flour, shaking each piece to remove any excess. Next, dip the eggplant slices into the egg, allowing it to drip before moving onto the third dish. Then, coat the eggplant in the breadcrumbs evenly on both sides. Working in batches, carefully place the breaded eggplant into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to the cooling rack on the baking sheet. Sprinkle each slice generously with kosher salt. Continue this process until all the eggplant rounds have been fried. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the basil stem from the marinara sauce. Remove the paper towels from the baking sheet.

Grease three 8-by-4-inch loaf pans and line them with parchment paper that comes at least 2 inches up the long sides of the pan. If you don&#39;t have 3 loaf pans, you can bake the layers in batches. In a large bowl or in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. With the mixer running on medium, gradually add 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Increase the speed to medium high and beat to stiff peaks. Set aside. In a large bowl or in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter, almond paste, salt and remaining 1/2 cup sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium and add the yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the lemon juice and almond extract, then reduce the speed to medium low and gradually add the flour. Mix to combine. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the whites. Transfer one-third of the mixture to one of the loaf pans and use a small offset spatula to spread it out evenly. Transfer another third of the mixture to a separate bowl and fold in the green food coloring. Fold the red food coloring into the remaining third.

If the bowl is cold, be sure the water temperature doesn&#39;t drop below 110 degrees F. Add the yeast and sugar; stir and allow them to dissolve for 5 minutes. Add the milk, butter, and honey. Mix on medium speed until blended. Add the egg yolks, 3 cups of the flour, and the salt. Mix on low speed for about 5 minutes. With the mixer still on low speed, add 2 more cups of flour. Raise the speed to medium and slowly add just enough of the remaining flour so the dough doesn&#39;t stick to the bowl. Add the flour slowly; you can always add more but you can&#39;t take it out. Knead on medium speed for about 8 minutes, adding flour as necessary. Dump the dough out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for a minute, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Grease a bowl with butter, put the dough in the bowl, then turn it over so the top is lightly buttered. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and allow it to rise for one hour, until doubled in volume. Grease two 9 x 5-inch loaf pans with butter. Divide the dough in half, roll each half into a loaf shape and place each in a prepared pan. Cover again with the damp towel, and allow to rise again for an hour, until doubled in volume. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the dough is ready, brush the tops with the egg white and bake the breads for 40 to 45 minutes, until they sound hollow when tapped.
