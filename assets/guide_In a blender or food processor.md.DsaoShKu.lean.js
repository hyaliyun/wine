Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the ginger, chiles and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the raw smell goes away, about 3 minutes. Add the butter, potatoes and 2 teaspoons salt and gently stir to combine. Lower the heat to medium and cook, occasionally gently turning over the potato and onion mixture from the bottom, until the potatoes are just cooked, but still firm, about 10 minutes. Some of the potatoes should have nice crispy edges and some of the onions should be caramelized.<br> Add most of the cilantro (reserving some for garnish) and gently stir in. Adjust the salt to taste. Gently flatten out the mixture and make 6 evenly spaced nests in it using the back of a spoon.

Add the remaining ingredients leaving the bread crumbs until last. Mix until all the ingredients are combined. Create a small patty and test it in a small saute pan in 1 tablespoon of oil. When browned on both sides, taste and re-season the meat mixture, if needed. Roll the mixture into about 20 to 25 or so balls that are about 2 inches in diameter. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat to avoid splattering, add the meatballs in a single layer and spread them somewhat apart so they have a chance to brown instead of steam. You may need to do this in batches. Brown the meatballs, over high heat, turning them so they brown all around. Treat them like hamburgers and cook them until they are medium-rare, about 3 to 5 minutes. Touch them to make sure they are still tender in the center. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to remove them from the pan to a tray and cook off the remaining balls, if needed. Add the meatballs to the hot tomato sauce and allow them to bubble slightly and simmer over very low heat for a few minutes. Shut off the heat and allow the mixture to rest for a few additional minutes before serving. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, the garlic, red pepper flakes, and sugar and season with salt, to taste. Stir in the carrots and re-season with salt. Cook for about 2 minutes, and then add canned tomatoes. Use a wooden spoon to break up some of the whole tomatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring from time to time, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add half of the water to prevent the veggies from getting too dry and continue cooking another 10 minutes. Taste for seasoning. The tomatoes should be fairly broken down and the flavors coming together. Add remaining water, as needed, and cook for an additional 10 minutes. The sauce cooks about as long as it takes to make the meatballs from start to finish, about 45 minutes. Stir in the basil leaves and season with Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 11804,&quot;Drunken Noodles (Phat Ke Mao) 48 ounces fresh flat rice noodles 4 ounces seasoning soy sauce<br> 3 ounces oyster sauce<br> 3 ounces sweet soy sauce<br> 2 ounces sugar<br> 1 ounce white vinegar<br> 6 Thai bird chiles 5 cloves garlic 6 ounces vegetable oil<br> 1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts, sliced<br> 12 ounces sliced green bell pepper<br> 12 ounces chopped onion 30 cherry tomatoes<br> 1 1/2 ounces fresh basil leaves 12 ounces lettuce leaves<br> Instructions: Unfold the noodles and divide into four portions.

Measure out 1/2 cup warm water and check the temperature: It should be between 110 degrees F and 120 degrees F (comfortable bathwater temperature). Sprinkle the yeast into a large bowl, add the warm water and whisk in the sugar. Let sit 1 minute (it should bubble and froth slightly), then gently stir in 1 cup flour. Set aside near the stove while you prepare the dough. Make the dough. Mix the melted butter and milk in a mixer with the hook attachment on low speed. Add the eggs and mix until blended. Scrape in the yeast mixture and mix until incorporated. Add 6 1/2 cups flour and 1 tablespoon salt; mix until the dough forms a ball, 2 to 3 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if the dough is too wet and sticky. Let it rise. Brush a large bowl with softened butter. Transfer the dough to the bowl, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place, 2 hours to 2 hours, 30 minutes. The dough should double in volume. Shape the dough. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dust a clean flat surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Flour your hands; gently press the dough into a 16-by-8-inch rectangle, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick (don&#39;t use a rolling pin). Cut the dough. With the short side in front of you, cut the dough in half lengthwise with a floured knife. Then slice crosswise into 12 strips. Shape the dough. One at a time, fold each strip of dough unevenly in half so the top part slightly overlaps the bottom half, then tuck the overhang underneath.

For the herb rub: Add the garlic, fennel seeds and red pepper flakes to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the oregano, rosemary and thyme and pulse into a rustic paste. Season with salt. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the rub for the mayonnaise spread. For the pork: Lay the pork belly on a cutting board, skin-side-up, and score the skin at 1-inch intervals, 1/2-inch deep with a sharp knife. Rotate the pork 90 degrees and score the skin again, to create a diamond pattern. Sprinkle generously with salt; be sure to get into all the crevices. Flip the pork over, sprinkle generously with salt, then rub the meat side with the herb rub. Roll the pork belly up as tightly as possible and tie it crosswise with butcher&#39;s twine at 2-inch intervals. Place the pork in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Pour 1/2 cup water into the bottom of the pan. Roast the pork to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Check periodically to ensure there is still some liquid in the bottom of the pan and add a little water to prevent scorching. Baste the pork belly with pan drippings a couple of times during cooking. Once the pork reaches 150 degrees F, raise the oven to 475 degrees F and continue roasting until the skin is super crispy, 30 to 40 minutes. For even browning, flip the pork halfway through the second roasting period. Transfer the porchetta to a cutting board and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.

Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat to maintain a low rolling boil and cook for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook another 2 to 3 minutes (depending on their size), skimming off any froth that rises to the top. Quickly lift out the shrimp with a mesh skimmer or slotted spoon, letting them drain well. Place in a bowl and set aside to cool. Remove the onion and garlic from the simmering stock; discard. Add the squid and cook for 3 minutes. Lift out with a skimmer, letting them drain well, and set aside. Reserve the stock for another purpose (it will make a delicious fish soup). Peel and de-vein the cooked shrimp; chop fine and place in a large mixing bowl with the squid and crabmeat. Finely chop the peeled medium onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and fresh herbs, and add to the bowl of seafood. Toss to distribute the ingredients evenly. Sprinkle the cracker crumbs and another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt over the mixture and toss very thoroughly. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until they form glossy, not-quite-stiff peaks. Add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition to incorporate thoroughly. With a rubber spatula, gently fold the beaten eggs into the seafood mixture. In a heavy-bottomed, medium-sized (about 10-inch) omelet pan or well-seasoned skillet with rounded sides, heat the oil over medium-high heat until fragrant but not quite rippling. Reduce the heat to low. Pour or spoon the seafood mixture into the pan, smoothing it firmly with a spatula to spread it evenly without air pockets on the bottom. Cook, uncovered, for 8 minutes. Flip the cake by sliding it back into the pan. If necessary, loosen with a spatula. Cook for another 3 minutes, until golden, on the underside. Transfer to a platter or large plate and serve hot, cut into wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 11908,&quot;Green Papaya Salad 8 ounces string beans 3 plum tomatoes 1/2 cup roasted, unsalted peanuts 2 large green papayas (1 pound each) peeled, seeded and julienned 1/4 cup Thai fish sauce 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon minced garlic 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced and thickened. Remove from the heat and divide as follows: for the basting liquid, pour 1/4th of the sauce into a medium bowl and whisk in the orange juice. Pour the remaining sauce into a medium bowl to use as the glazing liquid. For the ribs: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Sprinkle the ribs generously on all sides with salt and pepper and place on a rimmed baking sheet, bone-side down. Brush lightly all over with the basting liquid. Pour all the remaining basting liquid into the bottom of the baking sheet and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Cook 3 to 5 hours, basting with the liquid every hour and re-covering tightly each time. After 3 hours, begin checking the ribs for doneness by gently pulling at the middle bone to see if it will release easily from the meat. The ribs are also done with about a 1/2-inch of the bone showing on the ends, or a pull at the middle bone feels like it will release the meat. Once the ribs are cooked remove the aluminum foil and brush the ribs with the reserved sauce. Adjust the rack to the bottom of the oven, turn the broiler on high and cook the ribs until the glaze caramelizes, about 10 minutes. Remove the ribs from the oven onto a cutting board, tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into 1- or 2-bone slices and serve with orange wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11912,&quot;Elmo&#39;s Hearty Oatmeal Hearts 3/4 cup dark brown sugar 2 eggs 1 cup butter, softened 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups rolled oats 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup whole wheat flour 1 cup whole fresh or frozen cranberries Instructions: Step 1: Sweeten the Mix Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Make a fountain in the center and add the eggs, olive oil and some salt. Mix with your hands, adding just enough water for the dough to bind. You want to have a ball of dough that is fairly hard and a little dry, so add very little water. Cover with a towel and let set for an hour or so. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the butternut in half lengthwise and lay the squash on a baking sheet. Take 100g of the butter and divide it among each cavity of the squash. Sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until it starts to brown and the squash are soft to the tip of a knife, about 45 minutes. With a large spoon, scrape the squash off the skin into a bowl and set aside. Dice the onion about 1/8 inch; chop the garlic and thinly cut the sage. In a large saucepan on medium heat, heat up the olive oil. Add the onion and saute until golden brown. Then add the garlic and sage and sweat a little longer. Add the squash, season with salt and pepper and cook on medium heat until it has the consistency of a puree. Move to a food processor and pulse briefly to remove the large chunks. In a bowl, add the ricotta, season with salt and pepper and add to the squash puree. Fill a piping bag with the filling. Roll the dough with your pasta machine. Using a ravioli mold, fill each ravioli with the butternut squash filling. Cook the ravioli in a large saucepot with plenty of boiling salted water. Then saute in the remaining butter.

Roll the puff pastry out so it is slightly larger than the top of a 10-inch cast-iron pan. Turn the pan over on top of the pastry and cut around the outside edge of the pan to remove excess. Place the puff pastry round onto a baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to use. Add the sugar, apple cider vinegar and 1 tablespoon water to the cast-iron pan. Turn to medium-high heat and stir the ingredients together so that the sugar is completely wet. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the sugar turns a deep amber, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the butter and sea salt flakes; the mixture will bubble up slightly. Stir the caramel until the butter is completely melted and evenly incorporated. Let cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the apples, then cut each into thirds around the core, leaving you three rounded discs per apple. At this point, the caramel will have cooled and perhaps even hardened; that&#39;s ok. Place the apple pieces rounded-side down into the pan on top of the caramel, overlapping the edges slightly so you have an outside circle of apples and an inside circle of apples. Turn the pan back up to medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Once at a boil, turn the heat to medium low and simmer until the apples have softened and the excess juice from the apples has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Place the puff pastry round on top of the apples. Use a mini offset spatula or butter knife to tuck the edges of the puff pastry into the pan towards the apples, all along the edge. Whisk the egg together with a splash of water in a small bowl and then brush the puff pastry with the egg wash. Bake until the puff pastry is a deep golden brown, about 12 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes. Using a serving platter that is at least 2 inches wider than the pan and has a small lip on it to catch excess caramel, place it over the top of the cooled tarte. Place a kitchen towel on top of the platter and then fold it down over the cast iron.

Toss the tomatoes and garlic with the oil in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Put on a baking sheet and roast until the tomatoes and garlic are soft and the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly. Combine the egg yolks and lemon juice in a blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the melted butter and continue blending until emulsified. Add the tomato-garlic mixture and blend until smooth. Cover and keep warm. For the sandwiches: Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat until it begins to shimmer, about 2 minutes. Add the Canadian bacon and cook, turning once, until heated through and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a small plate and keep warm. Keep the fat in the skillet and the heat at medium. While the bacon cooks, use a 2-inch round cutter to cut a hole out of the center of each bottom half of the muffins (the bottom is the larger half, usually with cornmeal stuck to it). Melt some of the butter in the skillet until foaming and add the 4 halves of the muffins with the holes, cut-side down. Crack an egg into each hole (it&#39;s OK if the egg runs over the muffin), season with salt and pepper, and cook undisturbed until the bottoms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Using a flat spatula, flip the muffins and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes for runny yolks. Put the bacon on top after the first minute or so. Remove to a work surface, keeping the bacon sides up. Quickly add the remaining butter to the skillet and add the muffin tops cut-side down to toast. Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the warm hollandaise on top of each egg, then top with a toasted muffin top.

Tear the remaining bread into little pieces (about 20 pieces per slice); handle the bread lightly, so the pieces remain fluffy and don&#39;t flatten out. Place the bread pieces in a bowl, and sprinkle them with the wine; toss lightly to distribute the wine evenly.<br> Pick over the backfin and the jumbo lump crabmeat to remove any bits of shell. In a large mixing bowl, toss together the backfin and jumbo lump crabmeat. Season to taste with salt and with Maryland crab seasoning. Add the soaked bread, beaten eggs, lemon juice, and melted butter; toss lightly, making sure to keep the crab lumps whole. Add the mayonnaise, and toss the mixture gently with your hands, distributing the mayonnaise evenly. Taste again for seasoning, if desired (if you don&#39;t want to taste raw egg, you can saute a bit of the mixture in butter). For even better flavor, allow the mixture to sit in the refrigerator for a few hours.<br> When you are ready to cook, place a large, heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium-high heat; the pan should have enough room for 3 crab cakes. Add enough lard and vegetable oil (in fifty-fifty production) to create a 1-inch depth of oil. When the oil is medium-hot, quickly shape 1/2 the crab mixture with your hands into 3 cakes, each roughly the size and shape of a large hamburger. Gently place the cakes in the oil, making sure to preserve their shapes. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the cakes are golden on one side. Flip them carefully with a spatula, and fry on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. After about 8 minutes, the cakes should be golden brown on all sides and heated through (you want the pieces of bread inside to virtually disappear). Remove the cakes from the pan, and place them on paper towels. Repeat and make 3 more cakes with the remaining mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 11937,&quot;Herb Hamburgers 3 pounds ground beef 2 tablespoons dried thyme 2 tablespoons dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon dried sage Instructions: Preheat grill to medium heat.

Set aside while you prepare the shrimp. Divide the shrimp between 2 (8 or 9-inch) pie pans and pat them completely dry with a paper towel. Arrange the shrimp so they lay flat and are evenly spaced in the pans. Heat 2 large skillets over medium heat, or do this in 2 batches if you only have 1 pan. Season 1 side of the shrimp with salt and pepper. Add enough oil to lightly film the bottom of the pan and turn the heat up to high. Invert the pan of shrimp so they all fall into the skillet(s) at once. Saute the shrimp, undisturbed, until they turn golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Add a bit more oil and 1/2 the garlic to each pan. Turn the heat off and turn the shrimp over with tongs. Cook the shrimp for 1 minute in the residual heat of the pans. Transfer the shrimp to the bowl with the tomato mixture and toss to combine. Divide the shrimp among 4 plates or a serving platter and serve hot or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 11939,&quot;Healthy Mediterranean Baked Haddock Two 14-ounce cans cherry tomatoes 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives, sliced in half 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons capers, drained 1 tablespoon honey Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Four 6-ounce haddock fillets, skin removed 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 slices crusty bread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Remove from heat and add to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook. Proof the yeast by adding it to the warm milk and butter. Add the sugar and stir gently to dissolve. Let stand 3 minutes until foam appears. This indicates the yeast is active. Turn mixer on low and gradually add the flour. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and add the salt and 1 egg white. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Mix until the dough is no longer sticky, about 10 minutes. Turn the dough onto the work surface and knead for a minute or so by hand. Knead by folding the dough over itself and pushing out with the heel of your hands, not down. Rotate the dough and repeat. The dough is properly kneaded when you can pull it and it stretches without breaking. Form the dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise over a gas pilot light on the stovetop or in another warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it. If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen. Once the dough is doubled and domed, turn it out onto the counter. The act of turning out the dough naturally deflates the gas, so there is no need to aggressively punch it down. Handle the dough gently, overworking the gluten at this point will produce a dense loaf that is difficult to shape. *To form a loaf, pat the dough into a rectangle, fold the long sides to the middle then fold under the ends. Pinch the seams closed and place in a greased 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, seam side down. Make sure the dough touches all sides of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise a second time for 20 minutes or until the top of the dough is nearly level with the top of the loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, place a large pan on the bottom rack of the oven. Bring 3 cups water to a boil on the stove. Pour the hot water into the preheated pan to create a steam bath for the bread. This will make a crisp crust. Slash dough down the middle of the loaf with a sharp knife to allow the steam to escape during baking. Brush the top with remaining beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake the bread for 30 to 40 minutes until crust is golden and internal temperature reads 195 degrees F when checked with an instant read thermometer. The bottom of the loaf should sound hollow when tapped. Immediately remove the bread from the pan and cool completely on a rack.</p><ul><li>Variation: To make Cinnamon-Raisin Swirl Bread: after the first rise, press the dough out to a rectangle, sprinkle surface with cinnamon and raisins to cover.

Now add the steak, onion quarters, olive oil, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce and mix to combine. Seal the bag and place it in a dish to prevent leakage. Refrigerate for 12 or so hours, or marinate at room temperature for up to 2 hours. The marinating step is critical, so don&#39;t cut it short. Bring the steak to room temperature before cooking on a griddle for about 6 to 7 minutes a side; it&#39;s hard to say exactly how long it&#39;ll take as it depends on how you like your meat. I like mine pretty well still quaking and trembling on the plate, so be prepared to cook it for longer if you want better-done meat.

Peel back the outer skin. Alternatively, use a peeler to remove skin. Slice the yucca into 2-inch rounds. Put the yucca in a 3-quart stockpot. Add 1 teaspoon salt and cover with water, about 6 cups. Bring to a boil and simmer until the yucca is very tender, about 30 minutes. Drain excess water from the yucca, then mash until a puree is formed. Allow the puree to cool before forming the croquettes. Flatten about 1/2 cup (3 to 4 ounces) of yucca in your hands (you can use a bit of flour on your hands or food-safe gloves so the yucca doesn\\u2019t stick). Place about 1 ounce of mozzarella in the middle and form the yucca around the cheese into a flat oval patty; set aside. Repeat with the remaining yucca and mozzarella. Pour about 1 inch of oil into a frying pan and heat over medium-high heat until bubbling. Carefully place half of the patties in the oil and fry, flipping about halfway through, until golden brown on the outside but still tender on the inside, about 5 minutes per side. Using tongs, remove the enyucados from the oil and allow excess oil to drain; sprinkle with salt. Place the enyucados on a plate covered with a paper towel to absorb additional oil.

Set aside. Slice one cocktail frank almost all the way in half lengthwise, leaving the top quarter of the frank intact. Rotate 90 degrees and slice again so you have 4 strips attached to the unsliced top of the frank. Using a sharp paring knife, cut each of the 4 strips in half so you have 8 \\tentacles.\\ Spread the tentacles and place upright on a microwave-safe plate. Repeat with the remaining cocktail franks, using 2 plates to lay out all the octopi. Microwave one plate at a time for about 30 seconds, or until the cocktail franks sizzle and the tentacles curl slightly. Let cool. The franks will keep the shape that they were microwaved in. Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil to 360 degrees F in a heavy-bottom pot or Dutch oven. Place the cornstarch in a shallow bowl. In a second bowl, whisk together the flour, seltzer, egg and 1/4 teaspoon salt until smooth. Add the ice cubes to keep the batter cold. Working in batches, dredge the octopi in the cornstarch, tapping off the excess, and then drag through the batter. Let the excess batter drip off so the tentacles stay defined. Carefully add to the hot oil, holding each octopus by one of the tentacles for the easiest dipping. Fry, turning, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.

To mix the dough by hand, combine flour, salt and baking powder in a medium-sized mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Sprinkle the minimum amount of water over the butter and flour mixture and stir gently with a fork -- the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough, a tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily.<br> To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible--about 15 pulses in all. Scatter the minimum amount of water on the butter and flour mixture and pulse 5 or 6 times -- the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough,one tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough).

Cut the top 1/2 inch off each pepper. Remove and discard the stem, then finely chop the remaining flesh from the trimmed top. Scoop out the seeds and as much of the membranes as you can. Set the hollowed-out bell peppers aside. Set a 6-quart Instant Pot? to high saute (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add the olive oil to the pot; once it&#39;s shimmering, add the chopped bell pepper, onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, about 4 minutes. Add the ground beef, then cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon into small pieces, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes more. Stir in the diced tomato, chicken broth, tomato paste, chili powder, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomato starts to break down and the mixture becomes thick and saucy, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in 1 cup of the Cheddar and the rice until cheese is melted and rice is combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper. Turn off the saute function, then spoon the filling into the reserved bell peppers. Wipe out the Instant Pot bowl.<br> Set the rack into the bottom of the pot, then pour in 3/4 cup water. Add the stuffed bell peppers (they should fit snuggly).<br> Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 5 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete (this should take about 1 minute). Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid, then top the stuffed peppers with the remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar, dividing evenly. Place the lid back on the pot and let stand until the residual steam melts the cheese, about 1 minute. Use tongs and/or a large spoon to transfer the stuffed peppers to a plate and sprinkle with the parsley.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]&quot; 12009,&quot;Mini Cuban Reubens with Pulled Pork and Orange Mayo 2 pounds pork butt, cut into fist-size chunks Kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup garlic cloves<br> 2 cups fresh orange juice<br> 1/2 orange, peels only<br> 1 head red cabbage, cored and shredded 2 cups red wine vinegar<br> 1 cup orange juice<br> 1/2 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup Dijon mustard<br> 8 slices rye bread<br> 12 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated<br> 16 dill pickle chips<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter for finishing<br> Instructions: For the pork: Season the pork pieces with salt and place in a stove-top pressure cooker. Add the garlic, orange juice and orange peels. Place the lid on top put over high heat. Once it comes to pressure, cook on high pressure for 45 minutes. When finished cooking, cool and release pressure according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. Very carefully open the cooker and, using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a plate. Strain the remaining liquid into a high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat, reserving the softened garlic for later, and reduce until a glaze consistency, 5 to 10 minutes. This will be for your Orange Mayo. When the pork is cool enough to handle, using 2 forks or your fingers, shred it, transfer it to a heatproof bowl, and pour the reduced cooking liquid over the meat. For the kraut: Add the shredded cabbage, vinegar, orange juice, honey, and salt to a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When the liquid comes to a boil, remove from the heat and let cool in the liquid to room temperature. Once cooled, remove the quick pickled cabbage from the liquid and put into a bowl, storing in the refrigerator until needed. For the orange mayo: Add the mayonnaise, mustard and softened garlic to a large bowl and whisk to combine making sure the garlic is thoroughly blended. Pour in about 1/2 cup of the reduced orange sauce and whisk until thoroughly smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Line up all of the bread slices on a work surface. Spread each slice with 1 tablespoon of the orange mayo. Top half of the bread slices with 1/8 of the grated cheese, one-fourth of the pork, a small mound of the kraut, 4 pickle chips, and a second layer of grated cheese.

Add the Potato and Chive Gnocchi to the pot and allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes.<br> In a medium saute pan set over medium to low heat, cook the bacon until almost crisp, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and shallots and cook until translucent, about 30 seconds. Add the clams and Clam Stock. At this point remove the gnocchi from the pasta water and add it to the saute pan. Turn the heat to high and reduce the liquid by one-third, about 30 seconds. Add the heavy cream, butter and lemon juice. Continue to cook over high heat until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about another 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and season with salt and black pepper. In a separate, small bowl, combine the celery leaves, lemon juice and olive oil. Toss until coated and season with salt and black pepper.<br> To plate, spoon the gnocchi into a bowl and pour sauce over the top. Garnish with Crispy Shallots and top with the dressed celery leaves. While still hot, remove the skins from the potatoes. Pass the potatoes through a ricer or a sieve onto a clean work surface. Mix the riced potatoes, butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, egg and chives together until fully incorporated. Form the potato mixture into a square and top with the flour. Using a bench scraper, cut the flour into the potato mixture until completely incorporated. The dough should be tender to the touch and just a tiny bit moist. Do not overwork the dough or the gnocchi produced will be tough. Let the dough rest for 20 to 30 minutes, covered with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap.<br> Once the dough has rested, divide the dough into 8 pieces. On a lightly floured work surface, make snakes with each piece of dough by using your hands and rolling the dough back and forth. Then, using a bench scraper, cut each length of dough into 1/2-inch pieces. One serving is 15 pieces. Purge the clams in cold salted water for about 2 hours. This will remove any sand and grit from the clams.<br> Place the littleneck clams into a pot with the garlic, carrots, celery, onions, cracked black peppercorns, parsley, thyme and bay leaves. Cover the clams with 1 gallon water, and then cover the pot with foil. Bring to a boil on the stove until the clams have opened, about 10 minutes. Strain all the liquid and pass it through a fine mesh sieve to remove any sand. Reserve the liquid as our clam stock. Then pick all the meat from the clams and reserve for the chowder. Soak the sliced shallots in the milk for 30 minutes.<br> Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 250 degrees F. While the shallots are soaking, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne and paprika and mix thoroughly. Then remove the shallots from the milk and squeeze out all the liquid.

Put the wire racks in the baking sheets and coat each generously with cooking spray. Combine the flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large re-sealable plastic bag. Combine the eggs and 3/4 teaspoon salt in another large plastic bag; combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a third large plastic bag. Add about a half of the zucchini sticks to the bag with the flour and use a combination of your hands and shaking the bag to coat the zucchini. Remove the zucchini and shake off any excess flour. Transfer to the egg wash and repeat until coated. (It&#39;s less messy if you use only one hand for the dry ingredients and the other for the wet.) Let any excess egg drip off before transferring to the breadcrumb mixture; repeat until fully coated (you&#39;ll still see some green and white of the zucchini peeking through the breading). Transfer to the prepared baking sheets and coat the breaded zucchini generously with cooking spray (there&#39;s no need to turn them). Repeat with the remaining zucchini.

Cut butter into 8 pieces and add. Pulse to mix in finely. Add eggs and pulse until dough forms a ball. Remove from work bowl, wrap and chill dough. Soak the wheat in water to cover overnight if possible. Drain the wheat and place in a pan with salt and water to cover by 3 to 4 inches and simmer until tender, about 2 hours. Add water as necessary to keep from drying out and sticking. Cool and refrigerate until needed. For the pastry cream, combine sugar and flour in a small, non-reactive saucepan. Stir well to mix and add the milk, slowly, whisking it in smoothly. Whisk in the egg. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the pastry cream thickens and comes to a boil. Boil, stirring vigorously, about 1/2 minute. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and scrape into a clean bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface and chill. For the filling, place ricotta in a mixing bowl and stir the cooled pastry cream to make a smooth, creamy mixture; stir in the sugar, eggs and remaining ingredients. Stir in the cooked wheat kernels. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and set a rack in the lowest level. Butter a 9-inch cake pan, 2-inches deep. To assemble, cut off 1/3 of the Pasta Frolla and reserve it. Roll the 2/3 of the dough into a 14-inch disk and line the prepared pan with it. Allow the dough to hang over the edge of the pan. Pour in the filling and sprinkle it with the cinnamon. Roll the remaining 1/3 of the dough into a 10-inch square. Cut it into 10 1-inch wide strips. Paint the strips with the egg wash. Moisten the rim of the dough on the pan with the egg wash, and adhere 5 strips in each direction, forming a diagonal lattice. Trim away any excess dough even with the top of the pan and push the dough all around off the top rim of the pan so that it is completely within the pan. Bake about 45 minutes, until the filling is set and the pastry is light golden. Cool in the pan before unmolding. To unmold, invert onto a flat plate, lift off the pan, replace the pan with another plate or platter, then re-invert, so that the Pastiera is right side up. Serve the Pastiera at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12048,&quot;Garlic Bruschetta 4 heads garlic 6 ounces extra-virgin olive oil 16 plum tomatoes 1 cup fresh basil 1 cup fresh oregano 1 baguette Salt and pepper 8 (1-inch) slices goat cheese 4 fresh basil sprigs Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Separate the cloves of garlic from the heads and place in an ovenproof dish. Drizzle 1 ounce of olive oil over the unpeeled cloves and roast for 25 minutes until soft. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Quarter the tomatoes, remove the seeds, and dice. Finely chop the basil and oregano. Halve the baguette lengthwise and toast until golden. Peel the skin off of the garlic cloves. Mash the softened garlic and spread on toasted bread. Cut the baguette into diagonal pieces. Mix the diced tomatoes, chopped basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and another ounce of olive oil together. Spoon the tomato mixture evenly over the garlic baguette pieces. Top each piece with one slice of goat cheese and drizzle the remaining olive oil over the goat cheese and tomatoes. To serve, garnish with sprigs of fresh basil and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12049,&quot;Braised Pig Tails 1 cup olive oil 4 pounds pig tails One 12-ounce can your favorite beer 2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger 8 cloves garlic, chopped 2 medium carrots, chopped 2 large yellow onions, chopped 1 bunch celery, chopped 8 cups chicken stock or broth 10 sprigs fresh thyme 2 bay leaves Juice of 1 orange Salt 4 cups vegetable oil or shortening 1 cup all-purpose flour Barbecue sauce, for serving Toasted sesame seeds, sliced scallions and cilantro for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a large saute pan until hot, then add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. When the olive oil begins to smoke, carefully place the pig tails into the saute pan. Sear the pig tails until golden, then remove from the pan. Repeat as many times as necessary to sear all the pig tails. Once the pig tails are removed from the pan, carefully add the beer and deglaze the pan. Heat a large oven-safe roasting pan until hot, then add the remaining 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook the ginger, garlic, carrots, onions and celery until caramelized. Add the pig tails, then pour the chicken stock into the roasting pan (there should be just enough liquid to cover the pig tails and vegetables). Add the thyme sprigs, bay leaves, orange juice and two healthy pinches of salt. Cover the pig tails with aluminum foil and braise in the oven for 4 hours. Remove the foil and continue to bake for another 30 minutes. (This will allow the pig tails to gain a beautiful color and for the braising liquid to reduce.) Remove the pig tails from the roasting pan and strain the braising liquid. Refrigerate until ready to use. Once the pig tails are cool to the touch, trim the excess fat. Add the vegetable oil to a large pot and heat to 350 degrees F. Dredge each pig tail in flour and fry until crispy. Toss in your favorite barbecue sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds, sliced scallions and cilantro if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 12050,&quot;Cherry-Pistachio Biscotti 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup sugar<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 3 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup chopped dried cherries<br> 1/2 cup chopped pistachios<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Heat a skillet over medium heat, add the oil and saute the onions until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt, add the garlic and saute for 1 to 2 minutes without letting the garlic brown. Remove from the heat and cool. In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, gelatin, mustard, Worcestershire, hot sauce and eggs and season with salt and pepper. Let it sit for 5 minutes so the gelatin can bloom. Add the meat along with the crackers, parsley and cooked onion and garlic; mix with your hands until evenly combined. Place the meat mixture on a parchment-lined sheet tray. Using your hands, and without overworking the meat, form into 6 football-shaped free-form loaves. For the glaze: In a small bowl, combine the BBQ sauce, brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. Slather the glaze over the meatloaves and bake, basting again halfway through, until the meat registers 165 degrees F, about 1 hour. Let rest for 20 minutes. For the roasted russet potatoes with garlic and rosemary: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes cut-side down and cook, without moving, until golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip the potatoes using a fish spatula and lower the heat to medium low. Cover and cook until the potatoes are knife-tender, 7 to 8 more minutes. Toss the potatoes with salt and pepper. Add the rosemary and garlic, cover again, take off the heat and let infuse for an additional 45 seconds using the residual heat left in the skillet. Taste, adjust the seasoning if necessary and serve. For the green beans: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Set up an ice bath. Blanch the green beans in the boiling water until bright green and tender, a few minutes. Remove from the water and immediately plunge into the ice bath. Meanwhile, heat a saute pan with olive oil over medium-high heat. Toss the green beans in the pan with the lemon zest and juice and salt and pepper to taste until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot]&quot; 12052,&quot;Squid Saute with Tomatoes and Garlic 1 1/2 pounds squid, cleaned 15 garlic cloves, peeled 1/2 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper 2 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced 1 large bunch oregano, leaves only, chopped Instructions: Cut the squid bodies into 1/4-inch rings. Wash, dry and place in a mixing bowl. Puree the garlic with 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a blender until smooth. Pour over the squid. Add the salt and pepper, tossing well to combine. Heat a dry, medium skillet over high heat. Then add a generous tablespoon of the remaining olive oil and heat until almost smoking. Pour in one-third of the marinated squid and saute about 30 seconds. Stir in one-third each of the tomatoes and oregano and cook about 2 minutes longer, just until the tomatoes dissolve and the garlic colors slightly. Transfer to a platter, wipe out the skillet and repeat two times. Serve hot. This dish works best when the squid is sauteed in batches. If the pan gets too crowded, it steams rather than sautes, which toughens the meat. This can be served over rice and beans as an entree, or with flour tortillas as an appetizer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 12053,&quot;Chunky Ginger-Mango Barbecue Sauce with Mixed Grill 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling 1 medium red onion, chopped 1 small red pepper, seeded and chopped 2 mangos, peeled and chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup tamari sauce 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 (1-inch) piece ginger root, peeled 1 orange, zested and juiced 1 lime, zested and juiced 1/4 cup honey 1 cup chicken stock Hot sauce, a tablespoon or so 4 pieces boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs 4 loin lamb chops 1 cup chopped arugula or frisee or mixed baby greens Handful basil or tarragon leaves, shredded or torn Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil in a sauce pot or grill pan over medium-high heat.

Turn it upside down, and cut 8 X&#39;s evenly spaced across the bottom with a sharp knife. Push down on each X to make a hole into which you can place an ice cream cone so it will stand upright. Melt the chocolate, shortening and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until smooth, about 4 minutes. Pour the mixture into a small bowl, and stir in the mint extract. Pour about 1 tablespoon of the melted chocolate mixture into a sugar cone, and swirl to completely coat the inside. Pour any excess chocolate back into the bowl. Place the cone in the cone holder. Repeat with the 7 remaining cones. Let the chocolate set up at room temperature, about 15 minutes. Fill each cone to the top with ice cream, and top with an additional 1/3-cup scoop. Return the cones to the cone holder, and freeze to harden the ice cream, about 30 minutes. Put your desired topping in a small bowl. If the remaining melted chocolate mixture starts to solidify, heat it in the microwave in 10-second increments, stirring in between, until it is fluid again. Dip each top scoop of ice cream in the chocolate to mostly cover it, leaving a little bit exposed. Let any excess chocolate drip off, then immediately dip the top scoop in the topping. Work quickly, as the chocolate shell sets in seconds. Serve the cones immediately, or store them in the cone holder in the freezer until ready to serve. To freeze filled cones individually (for up to 2 weeks), roll each up in a large triangle of wax paper and tape closed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 12064,&quot;Thai Hot and Sour Shrimp Soup 1 pound medium shrimp, shelled and deveined, butterflied, shells reserved 1/4 cup lime juice 4 teaspoons Thai fish sauce 1/4 cup minced fresh green chilies 2 tablespoons very finely-minced lemongrass, from tender inner part of stalk, plus 2 tablespoons thinly-sliced 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 4 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons crumbled dried Kefir lime leaves (available in Asian markets or specialty food stores) 2 tablespoons finely-minced fresh coriander roots and stems 2 thick slices galanga root (available in Asian markets or specialty food stores) 2 medium shallots, coarsely chopped 2 teaspoons dried tamarind pulp (available in Asian markets or specialty food stores) 1/2 cup straw mushrooms, rinsed 2 heaping tablespoons fresh coriander leaves 2 teaspoons minced scallion Instructions: In a bowl combine shrimp, 2 tablespoons of the lime juice, 2 teaspoons of the fish sauce, 1 tablespoon of the green chilies, and 1 teaspoon of the finely-minced lemongrass.

Add yeast and let stand for 10 minutes. Mixture should get foamy or the yeast is dead. Mix in lard. In a food processor, add flour and yeast mixture. While blade is spinning, pour in water until a ball forms. If dough is too sticky, add more flour. If dough appears dry and doesn&#39;t form a ball, add more water. As soon as a ball forms, take dough out and knead by hand on a floured surface. For 10 minutes roll dough into one long log about 2 inches thick. Cut into 2-inch pieces. In a large bowl, mix the ginger, shrimp, garlic chives, eggs and sesame oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Make thick circles of the dough and place stuffing in the middle.

Make sure you wear gloves as you&#39;re peeling the beets unless you want your hands to be an attractive magenta color! Place the quartered beets in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Place over medium high heat and bring to a boil. Immediately lower the heat to medium and let the beets cook for about 20 minutes or just until fork tender. Drain the beets and run them under cold water. Drain and set aside. As you&#39;re doing this, get another pot of water boiling and drop the prepped asparagus into it for just 2 minutes. Drain the asparagus and run it under cold water immediately. This is called blanching. Drain and add to the beets. In yet another saucepan, add the water, orange blossom water, sugar and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the glaze has reduced by half and has thickened slightly. Toss with the vegetables, and add the roughly chopped garlic chives. Top with the chive blossoms and crumbled goat cheese and serve as a first course on a bed of mixed greens. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 12072,&quot;Double-Stuffed Gingerbread Cookies 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup unsulfured molasses 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon gingerbread spice 2 teaspoons baking soda 1/4 teaspoon baking powder Pinch kosher salt Clear or white sanding sugar, for decorating 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup spiced shortbread cookie butter spread, such as Lotus Biscoff Smooth Cookie Butter Spread Pinch kosher salt 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: For the gingerbread cookies: Beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the molasses, vanilla and egg until smooth and combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, gingerbread spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. With the electric mixer on low, gradually add the dry mix into the wet until just combined.

Season with salt and pepper. For the dressing: In a large pan, add the bacon and cook until crisp. Remove, leaving the fat behind, and chop. Add the chopped bacon to the bowl of cornbread. Add the sage, celery, onions and garlic to the pan and saute until everything is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add everything, including the fat from the pan, to the cornbread and toss. For the liquid: In a separate large bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the melted butter, buttermilk, stock and Worcestershire sauce. Season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Slowly mix into the cornbread until the mixture is moist enough to spread but not wet enough to drip--you may not use all the liquid. Taste and season again with salt and pepper if needed. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Add the dressing to the prepared baking dish, gently pressing down to even the top.

The rice flour will make the cookie crisper and more crumbly because it does not contain any gluten. Use an electric mixer set on medium speed to beat the mixture just until combined. Add the cake flour and lemon zest and mix just until the dough is smooth and holds together, about 30 seconds. Remove the dough from the bowl and pat into a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before using. This will give any gluten that may have developed a chance to relax. If you use the dough immediately after making it, it may be tough and elastic. The dough will keep, well wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for 1 week or in the freezer for 1 month. Thaw the dough in the refrigerator until ready to use. If you want to store the dough already rolled into a tart pan, wrap it in plastic wrap. When you are ready to use the dough, remove it from the refrigerator and give it 4 or 5 quick raps with a rolling pin. This softens the cold butter. Cut the dough into cookies with a round 2-inch plain cutter. The size of the cutter is determined by the size of mini tart pan you are using. Place the pieces in the flexible mini tart pan. Dock the dough. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool tart shells and reserve. Place the cream and honey in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Place the tea leaves in the cream. Cover and let sit for 8 minutes. Use a fine mesh sieve to strain the tea from the cream. Bring the cream to a boil one more time. Pour the cream over the bittersweet chocolate. Use an immersion blender and mix thoroughly. Pour the tea ganache into the cooled tart shells. This task will be easier if you use the automatic funnel or a cup with a spout. Place in the refrigerator for an hour. When the ganache has cooled, remove from the refrigerator. Use a knife to transfer gold leaf onto the top of some tarts. Other tarts can be topped with fresh exotic fruits.

Beat the remaining ice cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy but not melted, about 3 minutes; beat in the chocolate mixture. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, arrange the banana slices in the pie crust. Spread the dulce de leche over the bananas and freeze until cold, about 30 minutes. Scoop the ice cream over the bananas and dulce de leche and smooth with a rubber spatula. Freeze until very firm, 4 hours. Make the glaze: Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and whisk in the chocolate and corn syrup until melted and smooth. Let cool, whisking occasionally, until spreadable, about 15 minutes. Slowly pour the glaze over the ice cream; return to the freezer until set. Let the pie soften 10 minutes at room temperature before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 12088,&quot;Spiced Blueberry Jammin&#39; 2 (12-ounce) bags frozen blueberries One (1 3/4-ounce) packet dry pectin 1/4 teaspoon star anise, ground fine 10 to 20 grinds fresh nutmeg (or 1/4 teaspoon pre-ground) 2 tablespoons lemon juice 5 tablespoons (2 1/2 ounces) cider vinegar 3 cups sugar 1/2 cup water Instructions: For the jam: Place blueberries in saucepan over medium-low heat. Sprinkle with pectin followed by the anise, nutmeg, lemon juice and vinegar. Once liquid starts to gather in bottom of pan, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower heat slightly and boil gently for five minutes occasionally mashing mixture. Mash in sugar, add the water and return to a boil for 1 minute. You just made jam. Cool, jar, refrigerate and enjoy within 2 weeks. Or, move to the preserving phase.<br> Preserving the jam: Thoroughly wash all hardware in hot soapy water. Then pile everything (excluding the jar lids) into the pot. Cover with hot water by at least 1-inch and bring to a boil and maintain for 10 full minutes to sterilize. Turn off the heat, wait 5 minutes then add the lids (waiting will insure that the sealing compound does not melt). Leave all hardware in the pot until you&#39;re ready to can.<br> Remove the ladle, tongs, funnel and other tools from the pot, (careful please, it&#39;s hot in there) to a clean towel or paper towels. Using the jar tongs, remove and drain the jars, placing them on the towel/paper towel surface. (Avoid rock or metal surfaces which could result in thermal shock and breakage.)<br> Place the funnel in the first jar (pick it up by the ring, avoiding the sterile interior.) Use the ladle to fill each jar just to the bottom of the funnel, about 1/3-inch from the bottom of the jar threads. This \\headspace\\ is necessary for the jars to seal during processing.<br> Wipe the jar rims with a moist paper towel, checking for any cracks or irregularities as you go. Use the magnetized device of your choice to position lids on each jar. Screw the rings on finger tight. (Remember, the rings don&#39;t seal the jars they only hold the lids in place. Heat will drive out the headspace air, which when cooled will create a vacuum, thus sealing the jars)<br> Return the jars to the pot being certain that they don&#39;t touch the bottom of the pot or each other. (If you don&#39;t have a jar rack, try a round cake rack, or metal mesh basket. Even a folded kitchen towel on the pot bottom will do in a pinch.) Add additional water if necessary to cover the jars by at least an inch, and bring to a hard boil over high heat according to the table below. (Be sure not to start your timer until a true boil is reached. The headroom air may bubble out of the jars before a boil is reached. Don&#39;t be fooled.)<br> Processing times: Within 1,000 feet of sea level: 5 minutes 1,000 -- 3,000 feet above sea level: 10 minutes 3,001- 6,000 feet above sea level: 15 minutes 6,000 -- 8,000 feet above sea level: 20 minutes Above 8,000 feet: wait until you&#39;re back down at base camp. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 12089,&quot;One-Pot Lemon Ricotta Spaghettoni 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 bunch scallions, whites and greens thinly sliced and separated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch red pepper flakes 1 clove garlic, minced Zest and juice of 1 lemon 12 ounces spaghettoni (or thick spaghetti) 1/3 cup grated Parmesan (about 1 ounce) 1/3 cup whole-milk ricotta Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot (an oval Dutch oven or round braiser works well here, but any large pot will do) over medium-high heat. Add the scallion whites, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to caramelize, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the oregano, crushed red pepper flakes and garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic is softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the lemon juice, 5 1/2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper to the pot, scraping up any brown bits that may have formed on the bottom. Put the spaghettoni in the pot and spread it out as much as you can. Bring the water to a boil and cook, stirring frequently to make sure the pasta doesn\\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot, until the pasta is al dente, the mixture looks creamy and starchy and almost all of the water is evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the Parmesan, ricotta and lemon zest until the cheeses have melted and the sauce is very creamy, about 1 minute. Divide the pasta into 4 bowls and garnish each with scallion greens and a few more cracks of black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 12090,&quot;Mixed Seafood Salad 2 cups dry white wine 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns<br> 8 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 4 bay leaves<br> 4 sprigs fresh dill<br> 2 serrano chiles, halved, seeded and deveined<br> 2 lemons, quartered 1 bulb fresh fennel, cut into 1/8-inch slices 1 pound medium-large shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 pound cleaned squid tubes and tentacles, tubes cut into 1/4-inch circles (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 pound large sea scallops, halved 2 Meyer lemons, juice and zest of 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper<br> 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved<br> 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted, chopped<br> 1/2 cup sliced pepperoncini peppers<br> 2 orange bell peppers, cheeks only, cut into 1/4-inch dice<br> 4 cups baby arugula<br> 1 cup crumbled feta<br> 2 tablespoons capers, drained<br> Instructions: For the court bouillon: Combine the white wine, peppercorns, thyme, bay leaves, dill, serranos, lemons and fennel in a medium saucepan.

Place the bowl over the simmering water (the bowl bottom should not touch the water). Cook, stirring almost constantly with a rubber spatula and scraping down any splashes on the side of the bowl, until the custard reaches at least 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer and is thicker than the typical custard sauce, about 10 minutes. The idea is to cook the custard as much as possible without it coming to a simmer and curdling, which takes some time, so be patient.</li><li>Strain the custard through a wire sieve into another medium bowl to remove any bits of cooked egg. Add the salt. Using an immersion blender or hand mixer on low speed, beat the custard for 1 to 2 minutes to expel some of the steam and help cool it.

Heat the oil over medium-high heat until the temperature registers between 350 degrees F and 360 degrees F. Coat the asparagus, in batches, in beer batter, allowing any excess batter to drip back into the bowl. Drop the asparagus, in batches, into the hot oil and fry until the batter is deep golden brown and asparagus are crisp-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes per batch. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the oil temperature. Transfer the asparagus using a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Immediately mound the asparagus on a serving platter. Place the bowl of dipping sauce alongside and serve while the asparagus are still hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 12108,&quot;Leg of Lamb Open-Faced Sandwich with Black Olive Saltsa: Arni Psito 1 cup Kalamata olives, pitted 1 Calabrian cl, chopped 1 clove garlic, plus 3 cloves garlic, sliced thinly 1 tablespoon capers, chopped 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano 1/2 cup olive oil, plus 1/4 cup 1 teaspoon black pepper, plus 1 teaspoon 1 (5 to 6-pound) leg of lamb 8 small sprigs rosemary 1 tablespoon dry crushed oregano 1 lemon, juiced 2 teaspoons salt 4 pitas, halved 1/2 cup goat cheese, softened 8 ounces arugula Instructions: In a food processor, grind the olives, cl, single garlic clove, capers, 1 teaspoon black pepper, fresh oregano, and 1/2 cup olive oil together.

Cut butter into 1tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarseground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Sprinkle the minimum amount of water over the butter and flour mixture and stir gently with a fork the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough, a tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily. To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarseground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible about 15 pulses in all. Scatter the minimum amount of water on the butter and flour mixture and pulse 5 or 6 times the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough,one tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough). Sandwich the disk(s) of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press it into a 6inch circle.

Put the lid on and keep pulsing until the mixture looks like ground meat. Divide the meat into 4 equal pieces and get yourself 4 skewers. With damp hands, push and shape the meat around and along each skewer. Press little indents in the meat with your fingers as you go - this will give it a better texture when cooked. In a bowl, mix the salad leaves and mint. In another bowl, combine the sliced onion with a good pinch of salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice (the acidity will take the edge off and lightly pickle the raw onion). Scrunch this all together with your hands, then mix in the parsley leaves. Grill the kebabs until nicely golden on all sides. Dress your salad leaves and mint with a splash of extra-virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and some salt and pepper. Meanwhile, warm the flatbreads for 30 seconds on the griddle pan or under the broiler, then divide between plates and top each with some dressed salad leaves and onion. When your kebabs are cooked, slip them off their skewers onto the flatbreads - you can leave them whole or break them up as I&#39;ve done here. Sprinkle with the rest of the sumac, cumin, chili and fresh thyme, and a little salt and pepper. Now either toss the salads, grilled meat and juices together on top of the flatbreads and drizzle with some of the yogurt before rolling up and serving; or let your friends toss theirs together at the table, then dress and roll up their own, drizzled with some extra-virgin olive oil. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Cut the racks in half (leaving you with four 4-bone servings). Heat a large skillet over high heat, season the racks with salt and pepper and sear fat side down in the hot skillet until well browned. Turn the racks, fat side up and place in a 350 degree F oven for about 30 minutes. You can use a probe thermometer to check the temperature. (At Siro&#39;s we roast the racks in a 325 degrees F convection, 20 to 25 minutes to get to medium). When the racks are at the desired temperature, remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. While the lamb is roasting, heat a saucepan over medium-high heat and saute the shallots and garlic until soft. Add the Merlot, turn the heat down to medium, and reduce by half. Heat the demi-glace in another saucepan and let simmer slowly for twenty minutes. Stir in the reduced Merlot mixture a little at a time into the simmering demi-glace until you can just begin to taste the wine in the sauce. At this time we combine a little arrow root with cold water and stir it into the sauce to give the sauce a little bit of a shine and some thickening. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, ladle the sauce onto 4 warm plates, cut the lamb in half and serve with Roasted Garlic Bread Pudding, sauteed wild mushrooms, and a seasonal green vegetable. Set a skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons oil. When hot add the onion, celery, carrot, bell pepper, scallion, and minced garlic. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften, mince the rosemary and briefly rub in your hand before adding to the vegetables. Cook for 2 more minutes, season with salt and pepper and let cool. Combine the whole eggs with the egg yolks and beat well. Stir in the heavy cream and the roasted garlic puree until well blended. Combine the cream mixture with the vegetables and the dried bread cubes and mix well. Allow the mixture to stand overnight, covered in the refrigerator. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold into the bread pudding one third at a time and mound in a greased large muffin tin (you should get 4 to 6). Bake in a 350 degree F oven 45 to 60 minutes until golden brown. To roast garlic, cut the tops off the garlic heads and simmer in 1 cup of milk for 10 minutes. Drain, season with salt and pepper, and combine garlic with 3/4 cup oil. Place in a tightly covered pan and roast for 2 hours in a 275 degree F oven. Uncover and let cool. Strain the oil to remove unwanted garlic skin. Squeeze the garlic from the heads and place in a small blender and puree, adding the strained oil in a slow, steady stream to emulsify the oil into the puree. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 12132,&quot;Pear and Almond Tartlet Tartin 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 Bosch pears, peeled, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick on a mandoline slicer 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons poire williams (pear liqueur) 1 cup almond meal (finely ground almonds) 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/3 cup cold unsalted butter, diced 1/4 cup sugar 1 large egg 7 ounces almond paste Instructions: For the pear filling: Heat the butter in a pan over medium-high heat. Lay the pears around the pan and sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon on top. Move the pears in the sweet butter sauce and cook until caramelized, tossing them around once halfway through, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the pear liqueur and torch with a lighter, or if using a gas stove, slightly dip the pan away from you towards the flame and flambe the pears, shaking the flame around. Set aside to cool slightly. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly flour a clean workspace. Combine the almond meal, flour, butter and sugar in a food processor and pulse until the butter is well incorporated. Add the egg and pulse until the dough forms into a ball. Transfer the dough to the floured work surface and knead, and then wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll out each piece on a floured surface to a circle, about 9-inch wide, 1/8-inch thick. Set aside and do the same for the almond paste. Place each almond paste circles on top of a dough circle. Cut 4 circles, using the tarlet pan, that are slightly larger than the pan. For assembly: Mold the dough/paste circles into the tartlet pans, pinching the sides into the ridges. Layer the pears into the pans in a circular motion. Drizzle the sauce on top and bake for 30 minutes. Cool in the tartlet pans for about 5 minutes, and then push the tartlets out of the pan and cool on a cooling rack for up to 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 12133,&quot;Malibu and Pineapple 1 1/4 ounces coconut rum (recommended: Malibu Rum) Ice Pineapple juice, to fill Instructions: Pour coconut rum into a 10-ounce rocks glass over ice.

Spin at low speed. Using a ladle, add the chocolate to the spinning cherries. Add one ladleful at a time until the cherries are coated to the desired thickness. (Use a 50/50 ratio (50 percent chocolate, 50 percent weight of the cherries.) If a thicker coat is desired, use more chocolate and vice versa. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 12135,&quot;Shandies Two Ways: Ginger and Grapefruit 6 ounces light wheat beer 6 ounces grapefruit soda<br> 1 lime 6 ounces light wheat beer 4 ounces ginger beer<br> 1 lemon Instructions: For the grapefruit shandy: Add the beer and grapefruit soda to a pint glass.

Squeeze in the juice of 1/3 the lemon, and float a lemon wheel on top. &quot;,&quot;[Hefeweizen, Ginger Ale, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12136,&quot;Grilled Corn on the Cob with BBQ Butter 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 small red onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tablespoon ancho cl powder 2 teaspoons Spanish paprika 1 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder 1/2 cup water 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, slightly softened 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper Perfectly Grilled Corn, recipe follows 8 ears corn Kosher salt Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat until almost smoking. Add the onion and cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the ancho powder, paprika, cumin and cayenne and cook for 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup of water and cook until the mixture becomes thickened and the water reduces. Let cool slightly. Place the butter in a food processor, add the spice mixture and Worcestershire sauce and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, scrape the mixture into a small bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Bring to room temperature before serving and spread the butter over the corn while hot. Heat the grill to medium. Pull the outer husks down the ear to the base. Strip away the silk from each ear of corn by hand. Fold husks back into place and tie the ends together with kitchen string. Place the ears of corn in a large bowl of cold water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes. Remove corn from water and shake off excess. Place the corn on the grill, close the cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, or until kernels are tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove the husks and eat on the cob or remove the kernels. How to remove corn kernels from cob: To remove kernels from cobs of either raw or cooked corn, stand cob upright on its stem end in a large pan, holding tip with fingers. Cut down the sides of cob with sharp paring knife, releasing kernels without cutting into cob. Run dull edge of knife down the cob to release any remaining corn and liquid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 12137,&quot;Collard Green and Artichoke Dip 4 tablespoons butter 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 shallot, chopped 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 pint heavy whipping cream 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper 1/2 lemon, juiced Dash hot sauce Dash Worcestershire sauce 2 (10-ounce) boxes collard greens, thawed and drained 1 (14-ounce) jar artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Cook&#39;s Note: Starting with the sticky ingredients then adding the liquid makes it easier to blend. Pour half of the mixture into a large resealable plastic bag. Add to the bag the peppercorns, vegetable oil, and steak. Seal and massage the steak a bit before letting it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. If you need more time than that, refrigerate it, but make sure to bring it to room temperature before you grill it. Pour the rest of the marinade, onions, and garlic into a small saucepot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil then cover and lower to a simmer until the liquid reduces and thickens, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside. Heat the grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the plastic bag and gently pat dry. Discard the marinade from the plastic bag. Season the steak on both sides with a sprinkle of salt. Place on the grill, it&#39;s totally okay if a few peppercorns from the marinade hang on for dear life and go for a ride on the grill with the steak. Cook until the steak easily releases from the grill, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the second side for 5 minutes more for medium rare, which is best for this cut. Remove from the grill to a plate, cover with aluminum foil and let the steak rest 10 minutes, allowing the juices to redistribute before you slice it. Make notice of the direction the muscles in the steak are traveling and make sure to cut across or perpendicular to that direction to achieve the most tender results. Place the slices of steak in a serving dish and pour the glaze and onions over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 12139,&quot;Braised Sweet and Sour Spareribs 2 pounds lean pork spareribs, cut into single ribs 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons thin soy sauce 1 tablespoon black soy sauce 1 tablespoon Chinese red rice vinegar 1 tablespoon ketchup 1 tablespoon Shao Hsing rice cooking wine 1/2 cup cold water Instructions: Trim excess fat from the spareribs.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan or skillet over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the salmon steaks, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, until the flesh is nicely browned and crispy. Turn the salmon steaks over, and another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shallots to the pan and cook together with the salmon for another minute. Add the capers, olives, lime juice, and white wine. Cover the pan, lower the heat, and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve immediately on a bed of Couscous with Roasted Tomato. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of Chili Vinaigrette over each salmon steak just before serving. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Cut the tomatoes in half and place them, cutside down, on a baker&#39;s rack set in a roasting pan and placed in a 200 degree oven for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the skins can be easily plucked off the tomatoes, using your fingers, a pair of tongs, or a fork. Drizzle the peeled tomato halves with olive oil and return them to the 200 degree oven for another 11/2 hours, until the tomatoes are roasted to a dark red. The excess moisture will have evaporated, and the remaining tomatoes will have a delicious concentrated flavor and aroma. Prepare the vinaigrette by combining the vinegar, honey, jalapeno, cumin, scallions and salt and pepper in a mixing bowl. Whisk together thoroughly before slowly drizzling in the oil completely. Cook the couscous according to the package directions. Cut the roasted tomato halves into quarters, and combine with the steamed couscous. Add the basil and adjust the seasoning. Drizzle with vinaigrette. And toss to combine. 4 servings Whisk together vinegar, mustard and oil. Add chili paste and cumin.

In the container of a food processor, place the almonds, garlic, and cooled potato. Process until smooth. Mix the lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and sugar in a small bowl and set aside. Fill a large bowl with cool water. Drop the dried bread into the water, 1 slice at a time. When it is soaked, squeeze about half the water from the bread between the palms of your hands. Add the bread to the ingredients in the processor, alternating with the lemon-juice mixture, and process until smooth. Since the skordalia has a tendency to stiffen and become pasty as it chills, the mixture should be quite loose at this point. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Scrape the mixture into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for several hours to allow the flavors to mellow and blend. If the mixture seems too stiff, beat in a little water before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12156,&quot;Lace Cookies with Orange-Mascarpone Filling and Raspberries 1/2 cup pecans 1/2 cup sugar 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons molasses 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup heavy cream, chilled 4 ounces (1/2 cup) mascarpone, at room temperature 1 tablespoon orange flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest (preferably mandarin orange) 2 half-pints raspberries, rinsed and dried (2 cups) Fresh mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: For the Lace Cookies: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 18 by 12-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the pecans and sugar in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and process until the nuts are coarsely chopped. Add the butter, flour, molasses, cream, and vanilla and process until well mixed and the nuts are finely chopped. Transfer the dough to a bowl. Place heaping tablespoonfuls of the dough on the foil-lined baking sheet, spacing the cookies far apart and leaving lots of room to expand?makes only 6 cookies at a time. Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, or until bubbly all over and golden brown. Watch the cookies carefully, as they turn from brown to burned very quickly; the baking time may need to be adjusted according to your oven. Remove from the oven and place, still on the foil, on a cake rack to cool completely. Continue to bake the cookies in batches until all the dough is used. (Make extra cookies, as they are very fragile and break easily.) Once they are cooled, very carefully peel the foil away from the back of the lace cookies; it is very easy to break the cookies. If holding the cookies for any length of time, place in an airtight container. For the Orange Mascarpone Filling: Place the cream in a small bowl and whip by hand or with an electric mixer until fairly stiff. Using a whisk, stir in the mascarpone, liqueur, sugar, and orange zest until the mixture is smooth. Be careful not to over mix, because the mascarpone might separate. Use immediately, or set aside and refrigerate for up to 3 hours. To assemble, place 1 lace cookie on a dessert plate. Spread 1 tablespoon of the filling gently over the cookie, or pipe, using a pastry bag. Place 4 raspberries, equally spaced, on the filling. Place a third cookie on top of the raspberries and top with 1 tablespoon of the filling. Repeat with the remaining cookies and filling. Garnish each dessert with 3 or 4 raspberries and a mint sprig.

Butter an 8-inch round cake pan, line it with parchment paper, butter the paper, and dust the pan lightly with flour. Whisk the flour with the granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Lightly whisk in the butter, egg, milk, and vanilla, just until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then turn it out of the pan, flip upright, and cool completely on the rack. For the strawberries and cream: Set aside 1 pint of the best-looking whole berries for topping the cake. Hull and thinly slice the rest of the berries and toss with the granulated sugar. Set aside. Whip the cream with the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla to soft peaks. Refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble the cake: Cut the cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Place the bottom layer cut side up on a cake stand or serving plate. Drizzle the juices from the sliced berries over the cut sides of both halves. Fold a couple tablespoons of the whipped cream into the sliced berries and spread over the bottom layer. Top with the other piece of cake, cut side down. Spread the remaining whipped cream on the top of the cake and top the cake with the whole berries. Know-How: Cutting a cake into layers is easy as saw-spin-separate: Begin to saw the cake in half horizontally. Just before you reach the middle of the cake, give it a quarter turn. Continue to saw almost to the center, then give it another quarter turn and saw again until you reach your original point of entry. Saw completely through the cake&#39;s center and separate the layers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12162,&quot;Spicy Garlic-Lime Fish Sauce 4 to 5 Thai chilies, thinly sliced 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1\\u20442 cup fish sauce 1\\u20444 cup fresh lime juice (about 2 limes) 1 tablespoon light brown sugar Instructions: In a small jar add the Thai chilies and garlic.

In a food processor, combine the peppercorns, garlic, and cloves and puree. While the motor is running, drizzle in the oil until a paste is formed. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the garlic paste into a small bowl. Place the pork butt on a work surface and season all over generously with salt. Rub all over with the garlic paste. Place in an oven-safe roasting bag and close with a twist tie. Place in a large roasting pan, and cook until tender, about 5 hours. Remove roast from the oven. Slip the oven-roasting bag off the meat and discard. Transfer the cooking liquid to a medium saucepan. Skim the fat from the cooking liquid with a ladle or de-greaser. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer to thicken the juices slightly. Raise the oven to 400 degrees F. Return the pork, in the roasting pan, to the oven. Continue roasting, basting frequently with the simmering cooking liquid, until well-browned, about 30 minutes. If there is any cooking liquid left, pour it over the pork. Remove pork from the oven and let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. With the pork drippings you may make a vinegar sauce using this formula: for every 1/2 cup of drippings, whisk with 3 tablespoons vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Either carve the pork into thin slices, or, using 2 forks, pull into small pieces. Serve with the vinegar sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 12166,&quot;Tomatoes Stuffed with Quinoa Salad 4 beefsteak tomatoes, cap removed, cored and hollowed out Salt 2 cups cooked quinoa 2 kirby cucumbers, peeled, seeded and finely diced 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/3 cup chopped fresh mint 2 scallions finely sliced 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice Fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced Instructions: Salt the insides of the hollowed out tomatoes and drain them upside down on a rack.

Mix the milk with the eggs in one; the flour mixed with the seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, paprika and cayenne in another; and the meat in a third. Then have one clean plate at the end to receive the breaded meat. Work with one piece of meat at a time. Sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and black pepper, then place it in the flour mixture. Turn to coat. Place the meat into the milk/egg mixture, turning to coat. Finally, place it back in the flour and turn to coat (dry mixture/wet mixture/dry mixture). Place the breaded meat on the clean plate, then repeat with the remaining meat. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Drop in a few sprinkles of flour to make sure it&#39;s sufficiently hot. When the butter sizzles immediately, you know it&#39;s ready. (It should not brown right away, if it does, the fire is too hot.) Cook the meat, 3 pieces at a time, until the edges start to look golden brown, about 2 minutes each side. Remove the meat to a paper towel-lined plate and keep them warm by covering lightly with another plate or a sheet of foil. Repeat until all the meat is cooked. After all the meat is fried, pour off the grease into a heatproof bowl. Without cleaning the skillet, return it to the stove over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup of the grease back to the skillet and allow it to heat up. For the gravy: When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over the grease. Using a whisk, mix the flour with the grease, creating a golden-brown paste. Add more flour if it looks overly greasy; add a little more grease if it becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking until the roux reaches a deep golden-brown color. Pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Add the seasoned salt and black pepper to taste and cook, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Be prepared to add more milk if it becomes overly thick. Be sure to taste to make sure gravy is sufficiently seasoned. Serve the meat with halved biscuits. Pour gravy over the whole shebang! Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Stir together the flour, powdered milk, sugar, baking powder, cream of tartar and salt in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter and shortening into the dry mixture until blended thoroughly. Fold in the buttermilk until the dough comes together.

Whip the granulated sugar and eggs with a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Meanwhile, put the coffee, butter, vinegar and 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until the chocolate and butter are melted, about 3 minutes; then whisk together until well-blended. In a separate mixing bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt; whisk together. Add the oil and sour cream to the bowl with the chocolate mixture and mix well. Add a third of the flour mixture to the egg mixture and mix well to incorporate. Then mix in half of the chocolate mixture. Continue to alternate with the flour and chocolate mixtures, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally and finishing with the flour. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Fill each pan slightly below the top edge (you may not use all the batter). Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over the top of each. Bake until the centers bounce back when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. For the toffee sauce: Melt together the butter and brown sugar in a heavy saucepot and cook until simmering. Remove from the heat, then add the heavy cream and vanilla, and stir. Return to the heat and allow the sauce to boil for another 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour into a metal mixing bowl. Cool completely, then refrigerate. For the chocolate ganache: Place the chocolate chips, heavy cream and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 3 minutes. Stir until all the chocolate is melted and the ingredients are incorporated. Cool in the fridge until the consistency is like a paste. For the buttercream: Add the egg yolks to a mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer until light. In the meantime, mix the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Wet a pastry brush with water and wash down the sides of the pan to avoid crystallization. Continue to cook until the sugar syrup registers 235 degrees F (softball stage) on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat and, with your mixer running constantly at medium speed, immediately but slowly pour the hot sugar into the egg yolks in a steady stream. Continue to beat with the mixer until the mixture cools down completely. Add the butter, vanilla extract and vanilla bean seeds. Continue to beat until all of the butter is incorporated and the icing is smooth, glossy and spreadable (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add some buttercream to a pastry bag. To assemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate. With the pastry bag, pipe a border around the top edge of the cake layer for a \\frosting dam\\ to hold in the toffee sauce. Poke holes into the top of the cake layer and pour at least 1/4 cup toffee sauce (or more to taste) over the top so that it penetrates the cake. Then spread a thin layer (about 1/8-inch thick) of ganache over the top. Put in the freezer for 5 minutes to make the ganache solidify. Then spread a layer of buttercream over the top of the chilled ganache. Generously sprinkle some English toffee bits over the buttercream and drizzle with more toffee sauce and ganache. Place the second cake layer on top and ice with the buttercream. Drizzle the top with more ganache and toffee sauce, then sprinkle toffee bits over the top. Serve immediately or refrigerate, covered. Take out of the fridge 1 hour prior to serving, to bring to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 12172,&quot;Fillet Van Zeetong Bones from sole 1 cup fish stock 1 cup dry white wine 12 fillets of sole, totaling 1 3/4 pounds, rinsed, plus 1 more pound fillets, ground smooth for quenelles 1 cup cold water 1/2 cup unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups flour, sifted 1 egg and 2 egg whites, beaten together Freshly ground salt Freshly ground pepper 1 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream 1/2 Granny Smith apple, peeled and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons Calvados 1/2 teaspoon curry powder 12 medium shrimp, shelled and deveined 2 tablespoons or more beurre manie, recipe follows 1/4 cup soft butter (unsalted) 1/2 cup flour Instructions: In large saute pan, heat fish bones, fish stock, and wine.

Butter just the sides of a 9-inch round cake pan. For the caramel topping: Stir the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, and gently swirl the saucepan occasionally until the mixture is the color of light amber, 4 to 5 minutes. If needed, brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and carefully whisk in the butter (take care: the mixture can bubble up considerably). Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, tilting the pan to cover most of the bottom (be careful: the pan will be very hot from the caramel). Scatter the blueberries over the caramel. For the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the milk and sour cream together in a small bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed, then beat in the vanilla and lemon zest. Reduce the mixer speed to low, and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk-sour cream mixture, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the batter over the blueberries in the cake pan, and spread evenly. Bake the cake until it is golden brown and bounces back when pressed and a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until just cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter over the cake pan and, while holding them together, quickly flip them over so the cake unmolds, blueberry-side up. Let cool completely.

Cook the lasagna noodles in plenty of boiling salted water until pliable and barely tender, about 10 minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. Drain the noodles thoroughly and coat with olive oil to keep them moist and easy to work with. Coat a large skillet with olive oil, add beef and sausage and brown until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. In a food processor, combine the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, basil, parsley, an oregano. Process until pureed, add to the pan with the ground meat and stir to combine. Stir in the flour. Add the wine and cook until it has reduced by half. Stir in the tomatoes and add the heavy cream and the cinnamon. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta and the parmesan. Stir in the eggs and season with salt and pepper. To assemble the lasagna: Coat the bottom of a deep 13 by 9-inch pan with olive oil. Arrange 4 noodles lengthwise in a slightly overlapping layer on the sauce. Then, line each end of the pan with a lasagna noodle. This forms a collar that holds in the corners. Dollop 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the pasta, spread to the edges with a spatula. Spread 1/2 of the meat mixture over the ricotta. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella on top of the ricotta.

Add the all-purpose and almond flours, cocoa powder and baking powder; beat until just combined. Place the mixture between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll to about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet and refrigerate for about 20 minutes to chill. Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F. Bake for 20 minutes. Cut into shapes that will fit inside 12 single-serving dessert molds. For the sponge cake: Preheat the oven to 335 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the almond paste and confectioners&#39; sugar for about 1 minute. Slowly add the egg yolks, mixing until combined. Add the flour and cocoa powder and mix until combined. Add the melted butter and mix until combined. In a separate stand mixer bowl, whip the egg whites and granulated sugar using the whip attachment until they form a meringue with stiff peaks. Fold into the egg yolk mixture, then pour into the prepared baking sheet. Bake for about 12 minutes. Let cool before cutting into shapes that will fit inside the dessert molds. For the coffee ganache: Heat the cream and coffee beans together in a small saucepan until the cream just begins to boil. Remove from the heat and let sit to allow the coffee to infuse the cream, 20 to 30 minutes. Slowly stir the gelatin into 1 ounce cold water and let sit for about 5 minutes. Reheat the cream to just boiling and pour over the chocolate. Stir in the gelatin and butter. Place into chocolate molds and freeze until solid. For the coffee mousse: Soak the gelatin sheets in cold water and set aside for at least 5 minutes. Bring 13.5 ounces of the heavy cream to a boil and add the coffee beans. Remove from the heat and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Whip the remaining 18 ounces heavy cream with the sugar until it holds soft peaks. Remove the gelatin sheets from the water and place in a microwave-safe cup; microwave in 10-second intervals until dissolved. Add the gelatin to the coffee cream, then fold in the whipped cream. To assemble: Pop the coffee ganache out of the chocolate molds. Start filling dessert molds with the coffee mousse. When about half full, add a layer of sponge cake and a piece of coffee ganache to each. Continue to fill until the molds are just about full. Add the streusel base and smooth off the bottom. Freeze until solid. Remove from the molds and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.

They take on fantastic flavor and go so well, when eaten hot, with roasted fish or white meat. They&#39;re also really good served cold as an antipasto. Please give them a try. To finish off this dish I&#39;m going to use a great flavor enhancer called gremolata. The classic combination is garlic, lemon zest and at-leaf parsley, all chopped together really finely. It can be sprinkled over stews, broths, soups or pasta dishes at the last minute. It really brings a dish to life. You get the fragrance and sharpness of the lemon and the hum of the garlic. Feed the runner beans through a bean cutter. If you don&#39;t have one, just run your peeler down each side of the bean to get rid of the stringy bits and then cut them into 1/2-inch pieces at an angle. Your runner bean stew can be cooked in advance or started just before you cook the fish. Heat a large saucepan, big enough to hold all the ingredients, and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil plus the oil from the jar of anchovies. Chop 4 of the garlic cloves and fry them gently with the anchovies and dried chili until it all goes soft and the anchovies break down into a mush. Pour in the crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce and add the beans and the rosemary sprigs. Season and bring to the boil. Place a lid on the pan and simmer gently for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the beans are nicely cooked. If the sauce gets a little dry, add a splash of water and give the beans a stir. Lay the monkfish pieces on a chopping board and slice them horizontally almost in half, so they open out like a book. Try to get them so you have an even thickness on both sides. Score the fish lightly and set aside. To make the gremolata, finely chop the remaining clove of garlic with a pinch of salt. Next, finely chop the parsley and the lemon zest. Mix these with the garlic, give it all 1 last chop and put aside to sprinkle over at the end. Heat a very large griddle pan or frying pan (or use 2 smaller ones). Season the fish well with salt and pepper and rub lightly with olive oil. Cook the fish for 2 minutes each side or until just cooked through (don&#39;t overcook). Take the beans off the heat, taste and season them once again, if necessary. Remove the rosemary sprigs and add the lemon juice. Place a pile of beans on each plate and top with a piece of fish. Sprinkle over the basil leaves and gremolata. Or you could serve the whole lot on a big platter in the middle of the table - family service style! \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Gradually work the mixture together, adding more flour if necessary, to make a soft but not sticky dough. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until it is smooth. Let the dough rest at room temperature, covered with an inverted bowl or wrapped in plastic, for 30 minutes. Form the dough into a round and cut into quarters. Working with one quarter at a time (cover the remaining dough with an inverted bowl to keep the dough from drying out), on a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rope 1/4 inch in diameter. With a knife, cut the rope into 1/2-inch pieces. With your index and third fingers held together, gently press down on each piece, beginning at the top and moving down toward the bottom, dragging your fingers toward you and causing the pasta to roll over on itself. Transfer the formed pasta to a lightly floured jelly-roll pan and let dry at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil, and add the pasta. Cook until the cavatelli are al dente, 6 to 8 minutes. They&#39;re done when they float up to the top. Drain and toss the desired quantity with your favorite sauce. Freeze leftovers. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 12209,&quot;Ice Cream Crunch Tacos 1 pint vanilla ice cream in a paper container, slightly softened 8 pizzelle cookies 1/2 cup chopped peanuts Store-bought hot fudge, for drizzling 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 5 large flour tortillas Dulce de leche, for spreading Rainbow sprinkles, for sprinkling 3 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter Instructions: Using a serrated knife, slice the carton of ice cream into 4 even round pieces. Peel off the carton, then place 1 disc of ice cream on each of 4 pizzelle cookies. Coat with peanuts and hot fudge, top with a second pizzelle and press down. Wrap in plastic and place in the freezer for at least 2 hours. Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over high heat for 5 minutes. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together well on a plate. Lay out the tortillas and spread them with a thin layer of dulce de leche, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Add a small amount of rainbow sprinkles across the dulce. Unwrap the pizzelle ice cream sandwiches and place them in the middle of each tortilla, then fold the tortilla around them to wrap well. If the tortilla is not large enough and there is a gap, cut the 5th tortilla in quarters and adhere 1 quarter to the bottom of each sandwich with dulce de leche. Coat the cast-iron pan with ghee and add the wraps, seam-side down, pressing down with the back of a spatula to sear, about 9 seconds. Flip and repeat the searing.

Rub the garlic with the oil, then wrap well in foil. Roast until soft and golden, about 35 minutes. In a bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, mayonnaise and sour cream. Push the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins and onto a cutting board; sprinkle with salt. With the flat side of a chef&#39;s knife, smash the garlic into a paste. Transfer the paste to the mayonnaise mixture and whisk vigorously to incorporate and break up any large lumps of garlic. Stir in the chives and add salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate. For the jalapeno fries: Fill a large, wide pot with 1 inch of oil and heat to 360 degrees F. Meanwhile, whisk the buttermilk and egg together in a pie plate or shallow bowl. In a second pie plate, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, paprika and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Dip a large handful of the jalapeno strips into the buttermilk mixture, letting the excess drip off. Toss in the flour mixture to coat. Carefully add the strips to the oil, and fry until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining strips, letting the oil come back to temperature between batches. Sprinkle the fries with salt as soon they come out of the oil. Serve the jalapeno fries with the roasted garlic ranch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 12236,&quot;Green Tea Ice Cream 8 large egg yolks 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar Pinch salt 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1/2 cup loose green tea 2 1/2 cups heavy cream Instructions: In a large bowl beat the egg yolks with the sugar and salt.

Rinse beef to remove any blood residue and pat dry with paper toweling. Rub with salt and pepper and set aside briefly. Combine shallots, garlic, thyme, parsley, sage and olive oil to form a smooth paste. Rub into beef and let sit for a minimum of 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat oil in a large saute pan with an oven safe handle, and sear beef on all sides. Roast in oven until the beef reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees F, about 20 to 25 minutes, so when you pull it out it will reach 145 degrees F for medium doneness during the carryover cooking while it is resting. (You will be using the pan juices for the lentils, so do not discard them.) While the beef is roasting, rinse lentils in a colander and examine to make sure there are is no foreign material (such as pebbles). Transfer to a saucepot with just enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce and simmer for about 20 minutes until lentils are re-hydrated and water is absorbed, then remove from heat. While lentils are cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute white onion until translucent. Add 2 tablespoons butter to the saute pan and when it melts, add shiitake, crimini, and portobello mushrooms to the onion pan along with sage and thyme. Cook mushrooms until they begin to soften and to give up their juices. Stir sauteed onion- mushroom-herb mixture into pot of lentils along with demi-glace. Lower heat and cook for a few minutes to integrate flavors, but do not allow lentils to get mushy. Remove from heat and keep in a warm place. Remove beef from oven and transfer to a utility platter to let rest. Strain pan juices from beef into lentil mixture and stir to combine. Keep covered and warm. Sliced rested beef into thin slices.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the butter, granulated sugar, salt and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Add the flour, then return to the heat, mixing vigorously with a wooden spoon until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed until the dough cools and the steam dissipates, about 4 minutes. Add 4 eggs, one at a time, letting each egg become fully incorporated before adding the next. The dough should be shiny, stretchy and slowly fall from a spoon in thick ribbons. If necessary, beat the remaining egg in a small bowl and add a tablespoon at a time until the dough looks correct. Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 2-inch mounds onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake until the puffs are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 25 minutes. Prick each puff with a skewer to allow the steam to escape, then remove the puffs to a rack to cool completely. Use a serrated knife to carefully cut the tops off the puffs; reserve the tops. For the cream: Microwave 2 tablespoons of the cream in a small bowl until warm. Add the espresso powder and stir until dissolved; place in the refrigerator to chill. Put the remaining cream in a large bowl, along with the vanilla and 4 tablespoons of the confectioners&#39; sugar. Beat with an electric mixer until the cream just holds stiff peaks. Transfer half of the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain or star tip. Pipe half of the puffs full of whipped cream; replace their tops. Add the chilled coffee cream and the remaining 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar to the remaining whipped cream in the bowl; beat until the cream returns to stiff peaks. Transfer to the piping bag (no need to clean in between) and fill the remaining puffs; replace the tops. Dust the cream puffs with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12251,&quot;Kids Can Make: Baked Egg-and-Harissa Tarts One 9-ounce sheet puff pastry, thawed 4 large eggs 8 red and/or yellow cherry tomatoes, halved Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoons prepared harissa 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 cup packed fresh parsley and/or dill leaves 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese 1 scallion, sliced 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Unfold the puff pastry, and cut it into 4 equal squares (you don&#39;t have to roll the dough out). Arrange the squares, evenly spaced, on the prepared baking sheet. Measure about 1/4 inch in from one side of each square, and score the dough all down that side almost all the way through with a sharp knife. Repeat with the remaining 3 sides, making sure the cuts meet in the corners (you&#39;re making a square within a square). Poke each inner square several times with a fork. Bake the dough until puffed and lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, then press on the center of each puff with the bottom of a measuring cup to make a well. Let cool completely. (These shells can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature.) Crack 1 egg directly into the well of each pastry shell.

Put the beef bones in a large, deep stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes to remove any impurities. Drain the bones and rinse them under cold water (reserve the pot). Transfer the bones to a baking sheet in an even layer and season with 2 teaspoons salt. Put the allspice berries, peppercorns, star anise pods, carrots, celery, cinnamon sticks, garlic, onions and ginger on a separate baking sheet. Drizzle with the oil and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Place both baking sheets in the oven and bake until the vegetables are softened and golden brown and the beef bones are caramelized, about 30 minutes. Transfer the bones and vegetables back to the reserved stockpot. If there are any golden bits on either baking sheet, carefully pour 1/2 cup hot water onto them, gently scrape up with a wooden spoon and pour the water and bits into the pot. Add 1 tablespoon of the rice wine vinegar, then cover the bones and vegetables with cold water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered slightly and occasionally skimming away the foam and any fat that rises to the top, until the broth is a deep brown and as much flavor and collagen as possible has been removed from the bones, 5 to 7 hours. Strain the broth into a large heatproof bowl or storage container. Compost the bones and vegetables.

Whisk to combine. Place 1 chicken, breast-side down, on a plastic cutting board and cut out the backbone with a pair of sharp kitchen shears. Reserve the backbone in a plastic storage bag and save for a later use (such as homemade chicken stock). Turn the chicken over and use your hands to gently press down on the breast to crack the breast bone so that it lays flat. Add the butterflied chicken to the container with the marinade. Repeat the process with the remaining chicken and nestle the birds side by side in the marinade, making sure that they are completely submerged. Cover with a lid and marinate in the refrigerator, flipping once halfway through, at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-low to medium heat. While the grill heats up, remove the chickens from the marinade and pat fairly dry with paper towels. There should be a light coating of marinade on the chickens but not too much because excess oil will cause flare-ups on the grill. Discard the marinade. Season the chickens liberally on all sides with salt and pepper and tuck the wings under the breasts. Place the chickens, breast-side down, on the hot grill and set 2 bricks on top of each chicken. Cook until the skin is light golden brown and crispy, about 25 minutes. Use tongs to carefully remove the bricks. Flip the chickens, return the bricks to the chickens and continue grilling until an instant-read thermometer inserted in to the thickest part of each chicken registers 165 degrees F, about 25 minutes more. While the chicken is cooking, add the tangerines to the grill, cut-side down. Grill until the flesh is deeply charred in spots, about 10 minutes. Remove from the grill and cool slightly. To serve, cut each chicken into 10 pieces and transfer them to a large platter. Nestle the grilled tangerines around the chicken pieces and top with the sprigs of mint. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 12271,&quot;Coconut Pudding with Roasted Rhubarb 1 cup roasted pistachios 1/4 cup sugar<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 3 tablespoons coconut oil, at room temperature<br> 6 tablespoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste or extract, or more as desired<br> 3/4 teaspoon coconut extract, or more as desired<br> 1/2 teaspoon rosewater, optional, or more as desired Two 13.5-ounce cans full-fat coconut milk<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 pounds rhubarb, chopped into 1-inch pieces 3/4 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste or extract<br> 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Zest of 1 lemon<br> Instructions: For the crust: Combine the pistachios, sugar and salt in a food processor and blend to a coarse crumb. Add the coconut oil and pulse until the mixture crumbles together. Distribute the mixture among 8 serving glasses and use a muddler or the back of a spoon to press it down evenly and firmly. Set aside. For the malabi: Whisk together the cornstarch, vanilla bean paste, coconut extract, rosewater, if using, and 1/2 cup coconut milk in a medium bowl. Whisk together the sugar, salt and the remaining coconut milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking often, until simmering, then pour in the cornstarch mixture in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. Continue to cook, whisking, until the mixture has thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and adjust the extracts and flavorings as desired. Divide the mixture among the 8 serving glasses (about 1/2 cup in each), then cover and chill for 4 hours or up to overnight. For the rhubarb: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spread the rhubarb on a rimmed baking sheet and top it with the sugar, vanilla bean paste, salt and lemon zest. Cover with foil and roast for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and roast for another 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.

Whisk together the water and honey. Turn the mixer to medium speed and slowly add the honey-water mixture and olive oil. The dough will come together when a ball is formed and pulls cleanly from the sides of the mixing bowl. If the dough is too wet, simply add a touch more flour until it pulls cleanly. Grease the inside of a large bowl or deep container with cooking spray. Add the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm area until the dough doubles in size, 60 to 90 minutes. The dough can be refrigerated until ready to use, with a damp cloth over it. For the sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the cl flakes and garlic and cook until the garlic softens, about 1 minute. Add the tomato puree and basil sprigs. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool completely in the fridge. Remove the basil from the sauce before using. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Prepare a 12-inch cast-iron pan by greasing the interior with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Divide the dough into 2 portions and roll out 1 portion on a floured surface, making a round sheet roughly 14 inches wide. (Wrap the other dough portion in plastic wrap and freeze for another use.) Place the dough sheet over the greased pan, lightly pressing the interior corners into the pan to prevent pockets. Place the strips of smoked mozzarella around the interior of the pan, making a circle with the strips along the entire edge. Cut the dough approximately 1 inch above the level of the cheese. Roll the dough over the cheese, lightly tucking the edges underneath to form a stuffed crust. Brush the stuffed crust with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. For the toppings: Ladle the sauce into the center of the pizza, creating a thin layer that barely covers the pizza. Finish by topping with the torn mozzarella, olives, and onions. Place the pizza pan over medium heat and cook until the bottom of the crust begins to brown lightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown and the center is bubbly, about 20 minutes. Use a large metal spatula to remove the pizza, then top with the torn basil and a drizzle of olive oil. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes, then cut into portions and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 12273,&quot;Round 2 Recipe - Spanish Dip 1 1/2 cups white beans, reserved from Spicy Spinach Stew recipe 1/4 cup spinach, reserved from Spicy Spinach Stew recipe 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 tablespoons lemon juice 1/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 pita pockets Instructions: In the bowl of a food processor combine the white beans, spinach, garlic, cumin and lemon juice.

Let soak until the raisins absorb the rum and become plump, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Mix the cake batter according to the package instructions. Drain the raisins and fold them into the batter with the walnuts and coconut. Pour into the prepared baking dish and bake according to the package instructions. Let cool completely. For the filling: Meanwhile, prepare the pudding according to the package instructions; refrigerate until chilled. Combine the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla in a large chilled bowl. Whip with a hand mixer or whisk until medium peaks form. Fold the whipped cream cheese into the prepared pudding. Fold the whipped cream into the pudding and cream cheese mixture. Refrigerate until using. For the garnish: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt the melting wafers according to the package instructions. Dip each strawberry into the melted candy all the way up to the green stem, covering all of the red of the strawberry. Let the excess drip off, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Let sit until the coating has hardened. Using a toothpick or skewer, mark lines across each covered strawberry to mimic the ribbed lines on a carrot. To assemble: Carefully remove the cake from the pan and place on a cutting board. Cut the cake into 1-inch cubes. Place a third of the cake cubes in an even layer in the bottom of a 3-quart trifle bowl. Top with a third of the filling. Repeat to make 2 more layers of cake and filling. Mix together the crushed gingersnap cookies and graham crackers and sprinkle over the top of the trifle.

Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer until the quinoa is tender (the little tails will pop out) and most of the water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes Drain off any excess water. Stir in the chopped cilantro, scallions, oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Serve warm or at room temperature. (The quinoa can be cooked, cooled and refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days. Microwave just enough to take the chill off, about 2 minutes, stirring about halfway through.) Make the avocado cream: While the quinoa cooks, process or blend the avocado, sour cream, Parmesan, lime juice, 1 tablespoon water, cayenne and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender until smooth and creamy. If the corn still has a chill, microwave it for about 1 minute. Build the bowls: Divide the quinoa evenly among 4 bowls. Top each with neat piles and/or rows of chicken, tortilla chips, corn, salsa and pepitas. Top with some sauce, a sprig of cilantro and a lime quarter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 12305,&quot;Maple-Roasted Turkey with Sage, Smoked Bacon, and Cornbread Stuffing 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 bunch fresh sage, leaves finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large onions, finely chopped 1 loaf cornbread, cubed (about 6 cups) 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 cups chicken stock 1 (12 to 14 pound) fresh turkey 1 cup pure maple syrup 1/4 cup hot water 8 strips smoked bacon 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 lemon, juiced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and remove the top rack. Combine the butter and sage in a mixing bowl, mash with a fork or spoon until the sage is well incorporated and the butter has flecks of green in it; season with salt and pepper. In a saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of the sage butter, add the onions, cook and stir for 15 minutes until soft and golden. Remove from heat. Put the cornbread in a large mixing bowl and scrape the sauteed onion mixture on top. Add the egg, heavy cream, and just enough chicken stock to moisten the stuffing without making it soggy (about 1/2 cup.) Toss well to combine, season with salt and pepper. Remove the neck and gizzards from the inside of the turkey and discard. Rinse the bird thoroughly inside and out with cold water, pat dry. Sprinkle the cavity and skin liberally with salt and pepper. Using your fingers, gently lift the skin from the breast and legs, and slip pieces of the sage butter underneath; massaging it in as you go. Fill the bird with the cornbread stuffing without packing too tightly; cook the remaining stuffing separately in a buttered baking dish. Truss the turkey; place it on a rack in a large roasting pan, and put into the oven. Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, whisk together the maple syrup and hot water to thin the glaze out a bit; use this to baste the turkey every 30 minutes. The turkey should take about 3 hours to cook (i.e. 15 to 20 minutes per pound.) If the legs or breast brown too quickly, cover with foil. About 2 hours into cooking, shingle the strips of bacon oven the turkey breast to cover; continue to roast and baste for another hour or so. The turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F (the thigh juices will also run clear when pricked with a knife.) Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest for 20 minutes before carving, so the juices can settle back into the meat. Skim off the excess fat from the pan drippings with a spoon and place the roasting pan over 2 burners set on medium-high heat. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up brown bits stuck to bottom of pan. Whisk the flour into the drippings, stirring as it thickens to prevent lumps. Add the remaining chicken stock and bring to a simmer; season with salt and pepper and hit it with a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor. Simmer for 5 minutes and then strain to remove any particles. Serve the gravy with the maple-roasted turkey and cornbread stuffing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12306,&quot;Sashimi of Fluke with Sweet Shrimp 16 slices sashimi-grade fluke, sliced thinly on the bias 16 cilantro leaves 32 chive tops 16 cooked sweet shrimp 1/4 cup nam plah fish sauce 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 1/4 cup shaved fresh cilantro roots* 1 cup shaved variety small chiles *substitute 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro Instructions: Lay the slices of fish over a cutting board. Roll 2 cilantro sprigs and two chive tops into four of the slices, so the tops of the herbs are exposed. You should have sixteen fish rolls that can be stood on end with the herbs coming out the top. Arrange the rolls and sweet shrimp on a chilled plate. Sauce: Combine the nam plah and lime juice in a small glass mixing bowl. Add the shaved cilantro, and steep for 2 minutes. Add the peppers and steep until desired flavor. Strain through a double cheesecloth. The longer the peppers steep, the hotter the sauce will become. Serve in small bowl as a dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 12307,&quot;Potato Casserole: Food Network Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing the baking dish 6 large russet potatoes<br> Pinch salt<br> 8 ounces sliced bacon<br> 1 cup milk<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter<br> Pinch garlic salt<br> Pinch freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cups grated Cheddar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray. Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Place the potatoes and salt in a pressure cooker with water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes until very tender, about 5 minutes. (If you do not have a pressure cooker, boil the potatoes in a pot of water with a pinch of salt until tender, about 20 minutes.) While the potatoes boil, cook the bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels and, when cool enough to handle, crumble it into small pieces. Set aside. Add the milk, mayonnaise, sour cream, butter, garlic salt, pepper and 1 cup of the cheese to a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Whip the mixture until thoroughly combined. Drain the potatoes and add to the mixer. Mix again to combine and the potatoes are whipped smooth. Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the crumbled bacon and remaining 1 cup cheese over the top and bake until the cheese is melted and the casserole is heated through, about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 12308,&quot;Chili Roasted Potatoes 1 1/2 pounds small red skinned potatoes quartered Extra-virgin olive oil, to coat 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Drizzle potatoes with a generous pour of extra-virgin olive oil. Toss potatoes with seasoning and coarse salt and pepper. Place potatoes on a nonstick baking sheet and roast 20 minutes or until just tender. Give the baking sheet a good shake after 10 minutes to avoid sticking. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 12309,&quot;Cookies and Cream Fudge 4 cups large marshmallows (about 36) 2 cups sugar 1 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Pinch kosher salt 3 cups white chocolate chips (about 18 ounces) 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup coarsely crushed cream filled chocolate sandwich cookies Instructions: Line a 9-by-13-inch pan with foil. Combine the marshmallows, sugar, cream, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and put over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the marshmallows melt and the sugar dissolves. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the white chocolate chips and vanilla, and stir until the chips are completely melted. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, and scatter the crushed cookies over the top and lightly press into the fudge. Let cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

Use a rubber spatula to mix the ingredients well until smooth. This is called a compound butter. Position rack in center of oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season each fish fillet with 1/2 teaspoon of the Baby Bam. Lay each fillet in the center of a piece of aluminum foil and spoon 2 tablespoons of the compound butter over the top of the fish. Bring the long edges of the aluminum foil together and make thin folds to form an airtight seal. One side at a time, bring the outer short edges together and fold 2 or 3 times inward to seal the sides of the pouch. Repeat with the remaining fish fillets. Lay the pouches on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Using oven mitts or pot holders, remove the baking sheet from the oven and cut the pouches open with kitchen scissors, or carefully unfold the pouches. Watch out for steam-keep your face away! Serve immediately. Place all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Stir well to combine, using a wooden spoon. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 12311,&quot;Roasted Pork Loin with Peach BBQ Sauce 4 cups peaches, peeled and sliced 1 cup brown sugar 2/3 cup ketchup 2/3 cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons garlic, minced 2 tablespoons ginger, minced One 2 1/2-pound boneless pork loin roast<br> Kosher salt and cracked black pepper 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken stock 1 1/2 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes Kosher salt 1/2 cup half-and-half 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup cream cheese, softened Freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: For the pork and peach bbq sauce: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Combine the peaches, brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and ginger in a food processor or blender. Pat the pork dry with paper towels and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Reserve half (about 2 cups) of the peach BBQ sauce and set aside. Transfer the pork, fat-side up, to a rack over a heavy-bottomed roasting pan and brush the rest of the sauce all over the pork. Add the stock to the bottom of the roasting pan. Roast the pork until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 140 degrees F, about 1 hour. For the smashed potatoes: Meanwhile, place the potatoes in large pot and cover with salted cold water. The potatoes will soak up that salt like pasta and it will make a big difference in flavor. Cover and bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and return them to the same pot, allowing them to dry. Heat the half-and-half and butter in a small saucepot over low heat. Add the mixture to the potatoes along with the cream cheese and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Smash the potatoes with a potato masher and set aside, keeping warm until ready to serve. For serving the pork: Transfer the pork to a baking sheet to rest for 10 minutes, and then thinly slice half of the loin. Store and reserve the other half for leftovers. Remove the rack from the roasting pan and place on the stove over medium-high heat. Whisk in the reserved BBQ sauce and scrape the bottom of the pan to incorporate the browned sauce. Cook until slightly reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve the sliced pork with the reduced peach BBQ sauce and the smashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 12312,&quot;Candied Bacon 1 pound bacon 1 cup packed light brown sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Roll out the dough into a circle, about 12 to 13 inches in diameter. Gently press it into a 9-inch pie pan and crimp edges with your forefinger and thumb. Prick the bottom of the pie crust all over with the tines of a fork to keep it from puffing up in the oven. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 45 minutes. Put the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until very tender, about 45 minutes. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees F and remove potatoes from oven; allow to cool slightly before scooping the flesh into a food processor. Puree until smooth, then add the eggs, cream, brown sugar, sugar syrup and vanilla extract. Pulse a couple of times to combine, then add the cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Put the pie pan on a rimmed baking sheet and pour in the filling. Bake until the center is set, about 40 minutes. Let cool completely, then transfer the pie to the refrigerator. To make the praline topping, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and add the sugar, syrup, pecans and salt. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the stovetop and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove the pie from the refrigerator and pour the praline topping over the cooled pie, spreading evenly with a spatula or by gently rolling the pie around at an angle so it hits the edges. Cool until topping has hardened, about 20 minutes. Serve. Combine the flour, ground pecans, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub the butter pieces between your fingertips and thumbs, or use a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the ice water and work it in until the dough holds together, being careful not to overmix. Squeeze a small amount together; if it is too crumbly, add some more ice water, a little at a time. Shape it into a smooth ball, flatten into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12323,&quot;Ancho-Grilled Pork Loin Capped with Smoky Paprika Cream, Served over a Zesty Black-Eyed Pea Salad and Fire-Roasted Poblano Pepper 1/2 pound dried ancho chiles 2 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 cup vegetable oil 3 pound center cut pork loin Salt and pepper 2 poblano peppers Olive oil 1/2 pound dried black-eyed peas 2 plum tomatoes 1 green bell pepper 1/2 red onion 1 ear fresh corn 4 ounces Lime Vinaigrette 1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves Salt and pepper 1/2 cup sour cream 2 teaspoons smoky paprika Instructions: Pork: Place the anchos in a large saucepan and cover with water. Place the pan over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the peppers for 15 minutes, or until soft to the touch. Drain, run under cold water, and drain again. When cool enough to handle, pull the peppers open and remove all of the seeds. Place the flesh in the bowl of a food processor. Add the honey, garlic, and salt. With the processor running, add the oil in a slow stream. Process until the mixture forms a paste. Set aside. Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper and set aside. Spray a large saute pan with cooking spray and place over high heat for 1 minute. Place the pork in the hot pan and sear for 1 minute on all sides. Remove from pan and let cool for 10 minutes. When cool, coat the pork liberally with the ancho paste. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Fire up your grill on high and grill the pork until the internal temperature is 120 degrees F, about 7 to 10 minutes per side. Use a instant-read meat thermometer for this - they&#39;re virtually foolproof. Remove the pork from the grill and wrap it in foil for 10 minutes. Black-Eyed Pea Salad: Place the poblanos over an open flame (one of your stove burners will do) and roast them until charred black on all sides. Place them in a paper bag and close it tightly. Set the bag aside until the peppers are cool enough to handle. Next, remove them from the bag and peel the skin off and discard - it&#39;ll come off very easily. Rinse peppers under cool water, cut in half, and remove the seeds. Drizzle each half with a little olive oil and set aside. If you&#39;re more organized than me you can soak the peas overnight. Drain them the next day, place them in a saucepan, cover them with water, and add a little salt to the water. Place the pan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and let the peas simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, adding water as needed, until tender. Remove from the heat, drain, and set aside. Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes, pepper, and onion into large dice and set in a large mixing bowl. Cut the corn off the cob and add to the bowl. Add the peas, lime vinaigrette, and cilantro, and toss. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Mound the salad onto the center of 4 dinner plates. Place 1/2 a poblano on top of each of the salads. Next, uncover the pork and slice into 1/2-inch slices. Divide among the plates, placing the pork on top of the poblanos. Quickly whisk the sour cream and paprika together and top the pork with a dollop. Serve the rest on the side. Serve immediately. Lime Vinaigrette: 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 1 teaspoon Cilantro Pesto 1/2 cup olive oil Salt and pepper Pour the lime juice into the cleaned bowl of the processor. Add the Cilantro Pesto and, with the processor running, add the oil in a slow stream. Process until the vinaigrette emulsifies. Add salt and pepper, to taste, and pulse. Set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 12324,&quot;Marinara Sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 teaspoon oregano, dried 1 teaspoons basil, dried 1 whole bay leaves 1/2 teaspoon sugar Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Over medium heat, heat oil in a large pot until hot. Add onion and garlic, saute for 3 to 5 minutes until the onions begin to appear translucent. Add the tomatoes, stir to mingle the flavors. Add in the herbs and bay leaves. Sprinkle in sugar, salt and pepper. Lower the heat and continue to simmer for 30 minutes, uncovered. Stir occasionally. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 12325,&quot;Tablescape Center Piece Mini Cakes Three Ways Nonstick cooking spray Flour, for dusting 1 (18.2-ounce) box vanilla cake mix 1 1/4 cups buttermilk 1 (16-ounce) can vanilla frosting 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, divided 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice Red and blue food coloring Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spray the mini brioche tins with nonstick cooking spray. Lightly dust with flour and place on a sheet tray. Line cupcake tin with white paper liners. Prepare the cake mix according to package instructions, substituting the buttermilk for the water in recipe. Fill the brioche tins and cupcakes 2/3 of the way to the top. You should get about 18 cupcakes. Bake, rotating pans halfway, until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Brioche tins will take about 8 to 10 minutes, cupcakes will take 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool 5 minutes before unmolding and cooling completely on a wire cooling rack. To make the poured icing for mini fluted cakes: Combine 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar with enough lemon juice to form a thin glaze about the consistency of syrup. Dye with equal amounts of red and blue food coloring until the desired lavender color is reached. Place the cakes upside down on a cooling rack fitted inside a sheet tray. Pour the icing over the top of the cakes, allowing it to drip down the sides and completely coat the cake. Allow to set up. Meanwhile, mix enough of the confectioner&#39;s sugar (1/4 to 1/3 cup) for the icing to thicken; it should be about the consistency of pancake batter. Add an additional drop or 2 of each food coloring to deepen the color. Place the icing in a small zip top bag and snip the corner. Pipe just over the top of the fluted cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. To make the frosting for the cupcakes, combine the can of vanilla frosting with enough of the remaining confectioners&#39; sugar to stiffen slightly and allow the frosting hold a shape when piped. Color with equal amounts of red and blue food coloring to the desired lavender color. Place in a pastry bag or a resealable zip top bag fitted with a round pastry tip. Put 12 cupcakes into lavender cupcake covers. Pipe the frosting on top, holding the tip just above surface of the cupcake and raising slightly as you squeeze to form a ball of frosting. To assemble: Place the cupcakes evenly spaced on the largest bottom tier and top each with a small sprig of lavender. On the middle tier arrange the fluted cakes evenly. On the top tier place 4 store bought petit fours. Once on the table, sprinkle the whole stand with edible glitter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 12326,&quot;Rosemary Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Skewers 1/2 pound beef tenderloin, cleaned 2 bamboo skewers Sea salt Fresh ground black pepper 4 rosemary sprigs 2 tablespoon cold pressed extra-virgin olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons Instructions: Cut the beef into 1-inch cubes, then skewer them with bamboo sticks and season the beef with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

Warm a medium saute pan over medium heat and melt the butter. Add the apple slices, cinnamon and nutmeg and cook until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Pour apples into a large bowl and cool in the fridge, about 5 minutes. For the streusel topping: Meanwhile, fill a gallon resealable plastic bag with the cheese crackers and use a rolling pin to crush into small crumbs, but not a fine powder. Add to a medium bowl with the light brown sugar and salt and stir to combined. Stir melted butter into the mixture, tossing to bind your streusel, and set aside for pie assembly. Back to the pie: Remove the apples from the fridge and stir in the light brown sugar, Cheddar, cornstarch and salt. Fit the pie dough into a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Gently press the dough against the sides of the skillet to form the bottom crust of the pie. (The crust will not reach the top edge of skillet and this is just fine.) Pour the apples into the skillet. Generously sprinkle the streusel on top of the apples and spread in an even layer. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until golden brown and bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes. Allow the pie to cool about 45 minutes before serving. For the lemon maple sage whipped cream: Meanwhile, zest the entire lemon into a medium bowl. Gather sage leaves together in a tight bundle and grate the bundle into the bowl with the zest (it&#39;s okay if a few larger pieces fall in). Add the heavy cream, maple syrup and salt and stir together until combined. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Use a rubber spatula to press on the lemon and sage mixture in the sieve, to get out all the possible flavor. Beat the cream until it holds medium peaks and serve a dollop on each pie slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 12332,&quot;Red Sauce Base - Marinara 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 large yellow onion, diced 4 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced or minced 2 cups minced or grated carrots 1/2 cup dry red wine 3 tablespoons fresh minced thyme Salt and freshly ground pepper 120 ounces canned whole peeled tomatoes, crushed 1 cup fresh basil leaves Instructions: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat.

Create a 6-inch well in the middle. Add the parsley, olive oil, eggs and yolks, 1 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper to the well. Whisk gently with a fork. When the center is combined, begin to incorporate the flours into the eggs a little at a time. Once you can no longer use your fork, use your hands to knead the dough. When the dough is shaggy, knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 2. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 30 minutes. Roll out the dough, using semolina flour as needed. The pasta should be about 2 centimeters thick. Fold the pasta in half lengthwise, then in half again. Slice into 3/4-inch wide ribbons, or desired width. Shake out the noodles and hold in nests. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it ferociously. Cook the pasta to al dente, about 3 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 2 cups pasta water. For the feta, lemon and pine nut sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until a drop of water sizzles when flicked across the surface. Add the pine nuts and garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the preserved lemon and 1 cup mint and cook, stirring, for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the reserved pasta water. Allow it to cook down and reduce for another minute. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, reduce the heat to low and toss the pasta to coat it evenly in the mixture. Add more pasta water if it needs a bit more sauce. Add about 20 turns of black pepper and top with the feta, a few pinches of crushed red pepper and the remaining 1 cup mint. Serve immediately and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 12345,&quot;Spicy Jumbo Lump Crabmeat and Black Bean Salad with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce and Cilantro Oil 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 2 fresh basil leaves, chiffonade 2 tablespoons finely diced red onion 1 1/4 cups olive oil Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 red onions, minced 1 jalapeno pepper, minced 1 pound dried black beans, cooked until tender and drained 1/2 cup Citrus Vinaigrette 1 teaspoon ancho cl powder 4 red bell peppers, roasted, peeled and seeded 1/2 medium red onion coarsely chopped 1 canned chipotle pepper 6 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 cup pure olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Combine juices, basil and onion in a blender and blend until smooth.

Brush a 10- to 12-cup Bundt pan with olive oil; dust with flour and tap out the excess. Whisk the all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Combine the granulated sugar and eggs in a large bowl; beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until thick and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and slowly beat in the olive oil until the batter is smooth. Beat in the vanilla and almond extracts. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in two additions, alternating with the almond milk, until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out with a few moist crumbs, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 15 minutes in the pan. Loosen with an offset spatula, then invert onto the rack to cool completely. Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and 2 tablespoons milk in a bowl until smooth; stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon milk if the glaze is too thick. Spoon the glaze over the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds and chopped almonds.

In another bowl, whisk the egg whites and water and add to the dry ingredients along with 2 tablespoons of the herbs. Combine with a potato masher until the mixture begins to come together. Then knead with your hands for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large zip-top bag, seal, and let stand at room temperature for 4 hours, or up to 24 hours. Transfer dough to a floured surface and roll out to 3/16-inch thickness, approximately a 24 by 18-inch rectangle. Trim away extra dough, if necessary. Sprinkle the remaining herbs on the center section of the dough and gently press down. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In order to achieve uniform cooking, fold over slender tail end of tenderloin and tie with kitchen twine. Set a large electric griddle at its highest setting; brush the tenderloin with the olive oil and sear on all sides until well browned, approximately 10 minutes. Rest the meat for at least 5 minutes or until it is cool to the touch so as not to melt the dough. Place the tenderloin in the center of the dough. Fold top part of dough over, flipping back about 1-inch of dough onto itself. Repeat with the bottom half of the dough. Press together the 2 flaps of dough and seal. Make sure the dough is not too tight around the tenderloin. At the ends of the tenderloin, press together dough to form a seal and cut away any excess. Transfer to a sheet pan, place in the oven and roast to an internal temperature of 125 degrees F, approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. The tenderloin will continue to cook 10 to 15 degrees more. Cut salt crust at 1 end and extract meat by pulling out of dough tube. Slice and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 12348,&quot;Nordic Breakfast Porridge 2 1/2 cups whole milk 1 cup barley flakes 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Kosher salt 1 pint raspberries 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1/2 Granny Smith apple, cut into matchsticks 2 tablespoons roasted pistachios, chopped 4 teaspoons chia seeds, covered in 1 tablespoon water 1/4 cup whole milk Ground cinnamon, for sprinkling Instructions: For the barley porridge: Gently bring the milk and barley flakes to a boil over medium heat in a medium saucepan.

Unroll the sheets of phyllo dough on a flat surface and cover them with a slightly damp towel. (If the towel is too wet, the dough will get sticky.) Working quickly so the dough doesn&#39;t dry out, place one sheet of phyllo on a board, brush lightly with melted butter, and sprinkle lightly with bread crumbs. Place a second sheet of phyllo on top, brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Continue until you have 4 sheets stacked up. Cut the sheets in half crosswise to make 2 almost-squares. Cut one of the goat cheeses in half horizontally, making 2 thin discs. Place each disc in the center of one phyllo square. Starting at one corner, fold the phyllo up over the cheese and continue folding and pleating the phyllo around the cheese, as though you&#39;re wrapping a round gift that&#39;s tied on top. You will end with extra phyllo dough on top; twist the excess into a topknot. Brush the discs all over with melted butter and place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Continue with the remaining phyllo dough and 2 goat cheese discs to make 4 additional packages. Bake for 20 minutes, until the phyllo is lightly browned. Allow to cool for 5 minutes. While the cheese packages bake, place the salad greens in a large bowl. Whisk the vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Still whisking, slowly add the olive oil, making an emulsion. Toss the salad greens with enough vinaigrette to moisten. Distribute the salad among 6 plates and place one warm goat cheese package in the center of each plate. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12353,&quot;Toasty Seeded Bread Sticks 1/2 recipe baguette dough, see below 1/3 cup, (3 ounces) sesame seeds 1/4 cup, (2 ounces) poppy seeds 2 to 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Kosher salt for sprinkling 1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1/4 cup, (2 ounces) very warm water ( 105 to 115 degrees F) 3 cups, (13 1/2 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 cup, (4 1/2 ounces) cake flour (see note) 2 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt 1 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon, (10 1/2 ounces) cool water (75 degrees F) Instructions: Mix the baguette dough using the instructions in the recipe. Divide the dough in half and use the other half for baguettes. Dust your work surface with flour and place the kneaded dough on the floured surface. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and allow it to rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for 1 hour. The dough will be soft but will not have doubled. Combine the sesame and poppy seeds in a small bowl. Pat the dough into an even 4 by 6 inch rectangle. Using a plant sprayer, generously mist the dough. Coat both sides of the dough completely with the seed mixture; make sure there are no bare spots. Gently brush the dough on both sides with olive oil and sprinkle it with kosher salt. Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper and oil the paper lightly. Stretch the rectangle so that it is a little longer. Using a dough cutter, cut the dough width-wise into twelve strips, almost 1 inch wide. Lift each stick, stretch it slightly so it&#39;s 8 inches long and lay it on the baking sheet. Place the sticks on the baking sheet with about 1 inch between them. Let rise for 30 minutes, until they become slightly puffy but not quite fully doubled. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone. Place the pan of bread on the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the oven door. After about 1 minute, mist the sticks with water 6 to 8 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Mist again after 1 more minute. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake 8 to 12 minutes longer, until the sticks look golden brown and are getting crisp on the outside. Brush the hot bread sticks with a little olive oil if desired, then transfer them to a rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. A variation on the baguette . Combine the yeast and the warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Combine the flours and salt in a large bowl. Pour the cool water and the yeast mixture over the flour, and mix with your fingers to form a shaggy mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. It should be supple and resilient, but not too smooth at this point. Let the dough rest on the work surface for 20 minutes, covered with plastic wrap or a light towel. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes. Don&#39;t overknead it: The dough should be smooth, stretchy, and resilient.; Recipe Courtesy of Amy Scherber . &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 12354,&quot;Lightly Picked Cucumber and Caviar 1 Japanese cucumber (long English will do) Pinch sea salt Splash white wine vinegar Pinch sugar Caviar, for garnish Dill sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Slice the cucumber as thin as possible but retaining a full green ring.

Spray an 8-inch round cake pan with baking spray. Line the bottom with a piece of parchment and spray again. Put the raspberries in a bowl and add the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar. Mash well and let sit a few minutes for the juices to release. Press through a mesh strainer to remove the seeds. Remove 2 teaspoons of the raspberry syrup for the frosting and set aside. Reserve the remaining raspberry syrup for the batter. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the eggs with the remaining 1 cup granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the cream, vanilla, lemon zest and remaining raspberry syrup. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the batter in 3 additions, mixing between each addition until just combined. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth out the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely, then turn out onto a cake stand or serving plate. For the frosting: In a stand mixer using a whisk attachment, beat together the sour cream and butter until fluffy. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until smooth.

When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set the mixture aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the hot half-and-half mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F, it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. Test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat.<br> Immediately whisk in the peanut butter and whisk until smooth. Strain the mixture into a bowl to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Rest the bottom of the bowl in the ice bath and let the mixture cool, stirring often, for 2 hours. Freeze according to the directions of the ice cream machine. Make the crusts: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour and sugar. Add the butter and mix until coarse and sandy.<br> Whisk the egg yolks, cream, and vanilla together. Add to the flour mixture and mix at low speed just until combined. If the mixture seems too dry, add another teaspoon of heavy cream. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until ready to use. (The recipe can be made up to this point and keep refrigerated for up to 2 days.)<br> Roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and cut out circles that are 2 inches larger in diameter than the mini-muffin cups.<br> Spray the muffin tin well with nonstick cooking spray, then gently press the dough rounds into the cups, easing the dough completely into the cups. Smooth out the folds by pressing the dough against the sides and bottoms of the cups (the walls will become a little thicker). Use your fingers to form the rim of each tartlet into an even edge, pulling or cutting off extra bits of dough, if necessary.<br> Spray the bottom-outside of another mini-muffin tin with nonstick spray and gently push it down into the tin with the dough rounds so that it \\spoons\\ into the bottom cups. This will help prevent shrinkage during baking. Chill for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Keeping the tins pressed together, turn them upside down on a sheet pan. Bake until the crusts are dry and golden but not brown, about 12 minutes. Let them cool upside down for 20 minutes, then invert the pans and carefully lift the top tin out, leaving the pastry cups in the bottom tin. Meanwhile, make the filling: Melt the chocolate and butter together in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, stirring frequently. When melted, remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt.<br> Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Pour the filling into the prebaked tart shells (still in their tins) and bake for 11 to 13 minutes, until the filling is set at the edges but still a little moist in the center. Meanwhile, make the caramel sauce: Pour the sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour 1/2 cup water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar to moisten it. Over high heat, bring the mixture to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pot occasionally to even out the color, until it is amber-caramel, 10 to 20 minutes. When the mixture is done, immediately remove the pot from the heat. Use a wooden spoon to slowly stir in the red wine. Set aside.<br> When ready to serve, arrange the tarts on serving plates. Put a dollop of the sauce on the plate on 1 side of the tart and a small scoop of the ice cream on the other side. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 12358,&quot;Alfredo Shrimp Scampi Casserole 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus more for the casserole dish 12 ounces rotini pasta 1 pound frozen peeled and deveined medium shrimp<br> 2 cups chicken broth 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 2 cloves garlic, minced Zest of 1/2 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/3 cup loosely packed fresh parsley, chopped<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream, warmed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Let sit for 10 minutes until it begins to foam. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour and salt and make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture and the olive oil. Using a fork, incorporate the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients until a dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, continue to work and then knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly coat a clean bowl with additional olive oil and add the dough, turning once to coat the dough in oil. Cover and set in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 pieces, using 1 piece for the pizza. Wrap the remaining dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze for another pizza. For the pizza: Stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle that will fit on the grill pan. Add the dough to the hot grill pan and cook until stiff and bubbles start to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until grill marks form and the dough is completely cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes. Transfer the crust to a baking sheet and top the pizza with the onions, potatoes, tomatoes and goat cheese. Add the loaded pizza to the oven and cook until the cheese melts, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 12364,&quot;Ultimate Stadium Corn Dogs 1 to 2 quarts peanut or corn oil One 8.5-ounce box corn muffin mix, preferably Jiffy<br> 3 tablespoons milk, or more as needed<br> 1 large egg 2 tablespoons juice from a jar of pickled jalapenos<br> Kosher salt<br> 6 hot dogs<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> Your favorite mustard, for dipping<br> Instructions: Fill a large pot halfway with the oil. (You should have a least 4 inches of oil in the pot.) Bring the oil to 350 degrees F over medium to medium-high heat. Line a plate with a paper towel. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the corn muffin mix, milk, egg, pickled jalapeno juice and a pinch of salt and whisk until blended. If the batter is really thick, add a little more milk. (It should be the consistency of thick pancake batter.) Let rest for about 5 minutes. Skewer each hot dog on a chopstick or skewer. Place the flour on a plate or sheet tray. Working in batches of three, dredge the hot dogs in the flour so they are completely coated, making sure to shake off any excess flour. Dip the hot dogs in the batter and turn to completely coat. Gently slide them into the oil and fry, rotating occasionally so they evenly brown, until golden brown all over, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove to the lined plate. Serve with mustard for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Zinfandel]&quot; 12365,&quot;S&#39;mores Pancakes 3 cups flour 1/4 cup white sugar<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br> 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3 cups buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 3 large eggs<br> 5 tablespoons butter, melted, plus 1 teaspoon, for the pan 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 2 cups chocolate chips<br> 1 1/2 cups chocolate-hazelnut spread 1 1/2 cups marshmallow cream<br> 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs<br> 1 1/2 cups mini marshmallows<br> Flakey sea salt, for sprinkling Instructions: In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In a second bowl whisk together the buttermilk, milk, eggs, melted butter and vanilla. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk just until you have a smooth, lump-free batter. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Using a 1-cup ladle, pour the batter into the hot pan. Sprinkle some chocolate chips over the batter. When the pancake is slightly browned on the bottom and you see small bubbles beginning to form on top, flip it with a large spatula. Cook the pancake until the second side is browned. Repeat with the remaining batter. Stack the finished pancakes on a plate and keep covered with a paper towel to retain heat until all the pancakes have been made. Set the oven to broil and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On the baking sheet, stack the pancakes 3 high with a layer of chocolate-hazelnut spread between each pancake. Top each stack with marshmallow cream, graham cracker crumbs and mini marshmallows. Broil until the marshmallows are charred, about 2 minutes.

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup orzo<br> 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest<br> 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 2 tablespoons good olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill<br> 1 cup small-diced feta, preferably Greek (4 ounces)<br> Instructions: Combine the flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a shallow bowl. Remove the tenders on the underside of the chicken breasts and save for another use. (This makes the chicken breasts an even thickness so they cook evenly.) Heat the canola oil and 4 tablespoons of the butter together in a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet over medium heat until the butter has melted and begins to sizzle. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and shake off any excess. Place the chicken, skin side down, in the skillet and cook over medium heat without moving for 12 minutes. With the chicken still skin side down, place the skillet in the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium heat (careful; the handle will be hot!). Turn the chicken skin side up, add the remaining 5 tablespoons of butter, and continue cooking for 3 to 5 minutes, until the butter is a nutty brown color and the chicken breasts are just cooked through (an instant-read thermometer will register 130 to 140 degrees F). Off the heat, sprinkle on the parsley. Divide the Lemon Orzo with Feta among four dinner plates. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and slice each breast crosswise in thick slices. Arrange one breast on each plate with the orzo. Spoon a few tablespoons of the brown butter over each chicken breast, squeeze on some lemon, and sprinkle with salt. Serve hot with a fresh wedge of lemon on each plate. In a large saucepan, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 teaspoons salt and the orzo. Return the water to a boil and simmer uncovered for 9 to 11 minutes, until the orzo is al dente. Drain. Transfer the orzo to a bowl and stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, dill, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.

Chop 2 of the chiles into fine dice and mix with the salt, garlic, and oregano. (New Mexicans traditionally like to leave a few seeds in the dish. The seeds give it life, they say.) With a very sharp knife, cut a horizontal pocket into the steak. Stuff the chopped chiles into the pocket. Brush the meat and the remaining cl with canola oil. Grill the steak on both sides to desired doneness. If using buffalo, watch carefully so as not to overcook (because it contains less fat than beef it cooks much faster and is best medium-rare). Salt and pepper the meat. Grill the remaining whole-roasted chili to get a nice grid mark on it. Lay it across steak for garnish. A teaspoon of butter on the steak as a special treat is heaven. To make brown butter, simply place the butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat and allow to melt and turn golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 12388,&quot;Comeback Sauce 3/4 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons chili sauce (hot or sweet) 2 tablespoons ketchup 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon hot sauce 1/4 teaspoon mustard powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt Instructions: In a bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, chili sauce, ketchup, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, mustard powder, garlic powder, paprika and black pepper.

Add the grated carrot and stir to combine. Season with salt and reserve. Combine the remaining sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer until the sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the fish sauce, garlic, lime zest and juice and a pinch or 2 of red pepper flakes. Spoon out a 1/4 cup of the sauce to baste the pork chops and reserve the rest to serve with the rice bowls. Heat an outdoor grill or large cast-iron grill over medium-high heat. Whisk together the 1/4 cup sauce and the oil and brush liberally all over the pork chops. Place the pork chops on the grill and cook until the pork is warmed through and charred on both sides, about 5 minutes total. The pork chops might stick a bit to the grill but that is okay - just use a pair of tongs to gently pull away as needed. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Cut each pork chop off the bone and thinly slice against the grain. To serve, divide the rice among 4 large bowls. Toss the carrots with the cilantro. Top each bowl with a few slices of the pork, divide the carrot salad among the bowls and top with the rest of the sauce.

Beat the mixture until it is a thick yellow paste and set it aside. Bring the half-and-half and milk to a simmer in a heavy, medium-size saucepan. Slowly beat the hot half-and-half and milk mixture into the egg and sugar mixture. This mixture should be hot, but not boiling. If it gets too hot or you add the egg and sugar too fast you will have scrambled eggs. Return the mixture to the saucepan and simmer for a few minutes as you constantly stir to make a custard-like consistency. Strain the mixture into a large bowl to chill overnight in a refrigerator. The next day, stir in heavy cream and vanilla before adding it to your ice cream machine. Follow the ice cream machine&#39;s directions to freeze ice cream. Ice cream is actually best right from the ice cream maker, when it is about 10 to 15 degrees F. If you can serve the ice cream right after it is made, it will have a soft and creamy texture like no other. You can adjust the above recipe by adding fruits, or even sweetened chocolate, to taste. When adding fruits to ice cream, blend them slightly with a food processor and sprinkle with sugar to enhance flavor. Let the fruit rest overnight with the original egg and cream mixture. Add the fruit in place of the vanilla. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 12412,&quot;Tortilla Soup 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small onion, chopped 8 cups Basic Chicken Stock, recipe follows 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 3 or 4 peppercorns 2 fresh chiltepin chiles, see Cook&#39;s Note* Corn oil, for frying 4 corn tortillas, cut in strips 2 cups Salsa Fresca, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 ripe avocado, sliced thin 1 lime, cut in 12 wedges 3/4 cup grated Monterey jack cheese 5 pounds chicken bones (necks and backs) 4 onions, halved (use skins too, if clean) 4 carrots 2 ribs of celery 1 bunch of parsley, rinsed 2 tomatoes 4 bay leaves 12 peppercorns 1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1/4 cup finely chopped onion 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 jalapeno or serrano cl, seeded, deveined, and finely chopped 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the oil in a large pot and saute the onion until soft. Add the Basic Chicken Stock, garlic, bay leaf, oregano, peppercorns, and chiltepin and simmer for 1 hour.<br> While the soup is simmering, fill a deep saucepan with corn oil to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 375 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have an oil thermometer, heat the oil until a piece of tortilla dropped in the oil sizzles immediately, but don&#39;t let the oil start smoking.) Fry the tortillas strips until golden brown and crisp. Drain strips on paper towels. Alternative method: If you prefer not to deep-fry, brush the tortillas lightly with oil before cutting them into strips, and bake on a cookie sheet in a preheated 350 degree F oven until dry and crisp.<br> When the soup has simmered 1 hour, puree 1 1/2 cups of the Salsa Fresca and add it to the soup. Remove from the heat. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.<br> Divide the fried tortilla strips into 6 wide soup bowls. Add 2 or 3 slices of avocado, a lime wedge, and some grated cheese to each bowl. Pour in the hot broth, add a dollop of salsa, and serve immediately, with the additional lime wedges on the side.<br> Put all the ingredients in a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming off the foam that comes to the surface. Reduce the heat and simmer, skimming occasionally, for 2 hours. Strain and discard the bones and vegetables. You may wish to refrigerate the broth and skim off fat before using in a recipe, or freezing. Mix all the ingredients together. For best results, let salsa stand at least half an hour before serving or incorporating into recipe. Use within 24 hours. (The Vinaigrette calls for 1 cup. Enjoy the remaining 2 cups in Tortilla Soup or just with chips.)<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 12413,&quot;Bruschetta Dip in an Italian Bread Bowl 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 small bulb fennel, trimmed, cored and finely chopped 1 small Japanese eggplant, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped Pinch of red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, halved 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1 round or oval loaf Italian peasant bread (about 8 inches) 1/2 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped 1/4 cup grated ricotta salata cheese, plus more for topping Crackers and/or crudits, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Pulse the flour, granulated sugar, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the almond paste and orange zest; pulse until fine crumbs form. With the motor running, slowly add the egg white and process until the dough comes together. (You can also mix the dough in a bowl with your fingers.) Put the pine nuts in a small bowl. Form tablespoonfuls of dough into balls with damp hands and roll in the pine nuts to coat completely. Arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until light golden around the edge, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12418,&quot;Chocolate-Nut Slab Pie 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/3 cup granulated sugar 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup cold vegetable shortening 2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 large egg yolk 1/2 to 3/4 cup ice water 4 cups salted roasted mixed nuts 2 cups semisweet chocolate chunks (about 10 ounces) 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 4 large eggs 1 1/4 cups packed light brown sugar 1 cup light corn syrup 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Heavy cream, for brushing Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor to combine. Add the shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the butter and pulse a few times until it is in pea-size pieces. Add the egg yolk and ? cup ice water and pulse a few times until the dough just begins to clump together; add up to ? cup more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed. Lay out 2 sheets of plastic wrap; put about three-quarters of the dough on one sheet and the remaining dough on the other. Gently pat each into a rectangle, using the plastic wrap to help you. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. Roll out the larger piece of dough into a 13-by-19-inch rectangle (about ? inch thick) on a lightly floured surface. Ease into an 11-by-17-inch jelly roll pan, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Make the filling: Pulse the nuts in a food processor until roughly chopped. Combine with the chocolate chunks in a bowl, then evenly sprinkle the mixture over the crust. Whisk the melted butter, eggs, brown sugar, corn syrup, lemon juice and vanilla in a bowl; pour over the nut mixture. Roll out the smaller piece of dough into a 10-by-12-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface; cut out ten 1-inch-wide strips of dough. Lay 5 strips diagonally over the filling, about 2 inches apart, then lay the remaining strips perpendicular to them. Trim the strips at the edge of the baking sheet (use the trimmings to extend any strips that are too short). Fold in the overhang and crimp the edges with your fingers. Brush the edges and the strips of dough with heavy cream. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake until the crust is golden and the filling is set, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely, at least 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 12419,&quot;Big Daddy&#39;s Deep-Fried Catfish 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup cornmeal 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 (12-ounce) bottle amber beer</p>",127)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
