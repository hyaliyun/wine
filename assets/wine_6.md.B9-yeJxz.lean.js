This single-vineyard Malbec offers a little bit of everything, and all in balanced, measured doses. The cherry and blackberry fruit is bold but pure, while chocolate comes in to darken things up. A textbook steak and potatoes wine with a bit of complexity, but mostly it's about easygoing fun.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"it","description":"Run by the Castellani family, this is a promising estate and one consumers should keep an eye on. This vineyard-designate cru strikes all the right chords: It's traditional and clearly territory-driven, yet it remains lush, generous and pleasing thanks to 32 months in oak casks and native yeasts. Chocolate, spice, black pepper, almond, earth, ginger, apple and wild herbs characterize a complex wine with velvety texture.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"de","description":"An affordable BA, presumably from a variety of vineyard sites, this is relatively light in body, but it's still a sweet little wine.

The current release is this '97 when most producers are onto the '99s.

Good for Chilean Pinot, but needs some fine tuning in future years.","province":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"it","description":"There's great balance here between mineral elements and fresh berry nuances that really gives this bright ros an extra aromatic boost.

More of a food wine than a solo sipper.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"ar","description":"Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time.

This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose.

The '07 Niclaire is vast in currants, rhubarbs, cola and cedar, with sizable but finely meshed tannins, and the tart acidity that marks all of the winery's 2007 Pinot Noirs. It's drinkable now, but just barely, so decant. But will benefit from up to six years in the cellar.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry.

Made with a few drops of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, which add perfume and flowers, it's a wine that won't come into its own for quite a while. Hold until 2013, at least, and it should provide interesting drinking for years after, in a proper cellar.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors.

You can decant it now, but better to hold until 2011 or so.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Disconnected in its youth, with separate oak and fruit elements that need time to find each other and marry.

It's fine now in rich fruit, but fairly tannic, and there's some tension of parts that 3C4 years should resolve.

The score reflects potential.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Longplay's 2008 reserve is quite different from its non-?reserve stablemate. The aromas include more earthy barnyard scents, the color has a hint of maturity, and no new oak was used.
