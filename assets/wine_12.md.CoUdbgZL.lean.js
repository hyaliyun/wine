The palate struggles to savor the modest citrus flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Citrus is the overriding component, but there are touches of apple and apricot on the nose.

A citrus ball if ever there was one.","province":"Central Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Woodsy berry aromas keep the nose upright and welcoming, but the palate doesn't do much other than push generic raspberry and cherry skin flavors.

Pure scents of dried apricot, citrus, jasmine and melon are coated with Asian spices, while the mouth is honeyed but nuanced, with flavors of dried spices, apricot marmalade and citrus fruits.

It's certainly not an ager, so drink up.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Michel Rolland consults on this exceptional Merlot. The blend is 77% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot.

Flavors are strident and linear at this young stage, underscored by vibrant acidity and fantastic length. You can enjoy it now for its brute force, but will be better rewarded by cellaring it for 5C10 years.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.","province":"California"},{"country":"ar","description":"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab. Production was only 175 cases; drink nowC2009. Imported by Southern Wine Group.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Made with 82% Cabernet, this interesting wine is showing all kinds of possibilities. It's a good red now, sturdily dry and tannic, with red cherry, pomegranate, sweet tobacco and allspice flavors. But it's a little juvenile. I would decant it as long as possible, and it should enjoy a cellar life of up to 10 years.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.","province":"Levante"},{"country":"US","description":"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas.

Hold until 2008, if possible.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"US","description":"Despite its youth, this is a complete and satisfying wine. Woodward Canyon reds virtually always develop well in bottle, and so you can assume that this will continue to improve. At the moment it is tightly wound, firmly built, a complex weave of purple fruit and tobacco leaf, leading into white chocolaty tannins.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Long Shadows Pirouette is made by Agustin Huneeus and Philippe Melka; it's 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 11% Syrah and 13% Petit Verdot.

Another fine effort from this young winery. Here is classic styling from a great vineyard source, with beautiful definition, and gorgeous, refined and sculpted fruit framed in concise, molded, firm tannins.

The penetration and elegance of this wine are what stand out; it's young and compact and suggests a long life ahead.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"An interesting wine, in that it doesn't fit the current rage for blockbuster Shiraz. As winemaker Charles Whish says, It doesn't have to be huge and rich and jammyit needs to have finesse and length.

All too often, the extra ripeness turns subtle nuances into thicker, less complex flavors. Barrel time adds butter and toast.

But somehow it seems less interesting than its cheaper sibling.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This dark, somewhat volatile reserve wine from the Hogue Cellars is trying to push the envelope, with mixed success. Small amounts of Syrah, Malbec and Cabernet seem to have pumped up the color and the tannins, without adding much in the way of fruit. Right now it's quite tight, and long airing does not improve it.

One reviewer called it candy wine; others found it a little thin.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This lightweight, tart-cherry flavored wine displays some coffee and game notes on the nose. The aromas and flavors are correct, but it's a bit hollow. It lacks the body (and shows more sourness) that most enthusiasts would want from an inexpensive quaff.","province":"Languedoc-Roussillon"},{"country":"US","description":"Red berry and cocoa aromas and flavors that have real appeal are undone by a vegetal, green-olivey element. It's a red that's just too green, as noted elsewhere here. Decent palate texture and black and white pepper on the back end just can't overtake the basic tart, green character.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"An example of the new style of wines that are beginning to emerge from the Languedoc: Rather than the sour, earthy wines of the past, the focus is on the fruit, which is bouncy and sweet.

Seductive aromas of pear, apple and peach lead to a muscular mouthful of Bartlett pear and just-ripe banana. No gimmicks here, just pure, unadulterated fruit balanced by just-right acids. Bar none, this is one of the best values in white wine. Must be that Chenin is still grossly underappreciated.","province":"Stellenbosch"},{"country":"US","description":"From this veteran winemaker, a wine that, at nearly five years, is beginning to shed its hard tannins.

Not so pungent that it can't be consumed on its own, yet assertive enough to pair with any Sauvignon-friendly dish.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Interesting and flavorful, taking the best from both grapes.

Screw-capped and plainly packaged, Lasira delivers the goods where it counts: in the bottle. The blend is three-quarters Syrah, one-quarter Grenache, and as the label points out, 0% cork.

Bold scents of black cherries, blackberries and earth rise from the glass and there's plenty of richness on the palate, even some slightly rustic tannins to help rein in all that fruit. Notes of licorice, tar and earth on the finish make it more than a simple fruit bomb.","province":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A very dense, chocolaty wine, with jammy currant and blackberry fruit.

But that's okay, because despite the wine's almondy, sugary aromas and flavors, it has the body and acidity to handle it all.

A big-production wine (270,000 cases) that satisfies.","province":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"The wine shows its 28 months in barrel with dark and smoky flavors infusing it from start to finish.

Possesses the beautifully ripe flavors that are expected of a great vintage, such as blackcurrant, cherry, white chocolate and cassis, with extra edges of smoky caramel and vanilla.

Differentiates itself from Napa with its softness and accessibility, but as great as anything from across the Mayacamas.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"In a word, massive, a masterpiece of Napa Cabernet from a great vintage. A barrel selection from three vineyards, and a mere 275 cases produced. This wine pours dark and thick, and announces itself with smoky oak aromas riding over cassis.

Best after 2004, and for many years afterward.","province":"California"},{"country":"pt","description":"One of the vintage's standouts, the 2000 Quinta do Noval is incredibly rich and intense, with a density that made me think I should reach for a spoon.

And it gets better every minute the bottle is open.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the first commercial reserve wine Patrick Campbell has released in more than 20 years of winemaking, and it is indeed something special.

Campbell is at the top of his game with this marvelous, ageworthy wine. Drinkable now, but best aged through the decade.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Deep and delicious, with an earth-driven nose that conveys quality. Chunky plum pervades the chewy, dark palate, which offers a gorgeous mouthfeel and admirable depth. Only on the finish do you get a slight hint of oak.

The palate sports perfect harmony; it's full of cola, cherry, plum and espresso. The finish is tight and right on the money.

The blend is Sangiovese, Cabernet and Syrah.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"Another classic wine from this fine Napa producer, and one that will live for a long time in your cellar. It is young and tight now, but through the tannins and acids the palate detects gobs of lush, ripe blackcurrants and plums, herbs and tobacco.

As good as it is now, this lovely wine will get better through 2009.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Incredibly pure fruit defines the sturdy, entirely inviting nose. This is one juicy, rock steady wine; the tannic structure is that of a fortress. There's unadulterated fruit at every checkpoint, and it hits like a hammer as it transitions from palate to finish.

This is one of the best Monterey County Cabernet Sauvignons in recent years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This blend of the two Cabernets is fantastically concentrated and delicious.

A stunning success for the vintage.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Gorgeous, beautiful wine, so strongly delicious on its own that it will be a challenge to pair it with food.

Blackberries, coffee and dried spices on the palate; it finishes long and firm, with hints of licorice.","province":"Douro"},{"country":"pt","description":"This dense wine is packed with fruit. The blackberry and anise aromas give an impression of the wine's impressive size that is confirmed on the palate.

Best after 2008.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Clean, polished;  the Cartizze cru yields delicate crushed stone and floral notes with background tangerine and cracker notes.

Pretty perlage and loads of complex, almond-like flavors in the mouth.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"fr","description":"With its source of grapes from northern Burgundy, this cool, collected wine is as close to Champagne in taste as is possible.

It's consistent with previous efforts and reminiscent of Reiningersatiny smooth, glossy and somewhat impenetrable.

The wine is dense, supple and extracted, with hints of spice, herb, lemon thyme and citrusy high tones.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry, tannic and concentrated, a fierce, almost feral wine, but it's classic in the way of California mountain Zins.

Compelling and complex, it cries out for a rustic beef or pork dish, long simmered and well-seasoned.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"A rare find in at, this shows the potential of Viognier. Flavors of apricot liqueur, summer flower aromas, and concentration come together to make a rich, powerful wine.

The Weinbau is old vine, and is the main component. This is a solid, meaty, deep purple and blue, with hints of smoked meat in the nose. Fruit flavors are tight, tart and run to the black cherry and blackberry flavors. Clearly varietal, with stiff tannins, a bit  chalky, but plenty of varietal character and a long finish with streaks of coffee and light herb. This is winemaker Ron Coleman's favorite red, and he gives it plenty of TLC that shines through in the bottle.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits.

Shows ripe, attractive cherry compote, black raspberry pure, cola, cocoa, coffee and spice flavors, with a rich, earthy edge of balsamic, sauted mushroom and oaky vanilla. Then there are the tannins. They kick in and give the wine a youthful, lively structure. Very nice wine, but be sure to decant it for a few hours.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Concentrated and showing a whiff of volatility, this is a blend of 62% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash each of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Grapes are sourced from three different estate vineyards on Red Mountain.

There are hints of rock, fennel and smoke, and a long, concentrated and well-rounded finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark, dense, ripe and oaky, this ramps up the oak flavors to higher levels, with rich layers of smoke, cedar, honey and butterscotch wrapped into the spicy, sweet fruit. As the wine ages and opens up the lovely cherry/cassis core fruit should come into the spotlight. Call it a Washington take on ripe, high-octane California reds.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.","province":"Levante"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure.

There is metallic minerality underpinning the tart, austere fruit, but there are also surprising high notes of brandied cherries, and a sense of depth missing in more ordinary wines. This is definitely a wine to cellar for up to a decade. As always, this is sensitive, detailed winemaking.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This doesn't disappoint. It's a Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot and Syrah.

Elegant and intense, it's ready now.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A 50/50 Cab/Merlot blend from Pepper Bridge, this is quite tight and reductive but grudgingly opens out. It's a stiff, hard wine, layered with blueberry, raspberry and cassis, and annotated with baker's chocolate and anise. Dark and unyielding, it has the muscle and authority to age for another six or eight years. There's a hint of green tea in the chewy tannins.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines.

Nicely built, still tight and chewy.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This single-vineyard 100% varietal bottling is too tough and astringent to drink now.

It's ready to drink tonight.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"au","description":"From one of Down Under's most dependable wineries, this rich, fragrant wine has lots to offer.

Best Buy.","province":"au Other"},{"country":"US","description":"This mid-weight Chardonnay offers some complexity, with spicy and leesy notes accenting the apple-pear fruit. A touch of pineapple on the nose and vanilla on the palate add further interest. The mouthfeel is even, though the wine shows a bit of alcoholic heat. It finishes with good length, showing butter and spice notes.","province":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"Very classic Riesling in a Mosel style with green apple, hay and herb and a hint of petrol on the nose. The mouth shows a slight spritz, brisk acidity and more of the crisp Granny Smith apple that shows on the nose. Finishes with bright, almost sharp acidity. Best Buy.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"A lean and classically structured wine, this 100% Merlot offers tart cherry and plum fruit wrapped in a toasty oak cocoon.

Best Buy.","province":"South au"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a full-bodied, bracing tart-cherry bomb with very attractive cedar, tobacco and graphite accents. Though it has a creamy texture, the wine sports high acidity that keeps the fruit very bright and provides a great edge for food pairings. Closes long with some tannic bite and dry cherry cedar-toast notes.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"it","description":"The mix in this deep, ruby purple- colored wine is 60% Gaglioppo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The structure is of good weight, and is round and finely balanced. Initially reticent with its aromatics, after breathing, the wine opens with a deep cherry, dry fruit and woody bouquet. The flavors continue into the long finish where earthy nuances then appear. This one needs some patience.","province":"Southern it"},{"country":"au","description":"Burge's allusion is to the trio of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvdre that he blends together in this wine, not to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Sweet, jammy aromas of crushed cherries laced with caramel pick up some creamy and cedary notes with airing, then cinnamon and red-earth and iron-mineral flavors spice up the palate. A bit tart on the finish, but this should smooth out over the next year. Will then drink well for five or more years.","province":"South au"},{"country":"it","description":"With its deep, tart-sweet black-plum aromas and flavors wrapped in a toasty oak blanket, this is an appealing, modern-style Barbera. The grape's native acidity is well tamed, but enough remains to make it a great food match. Has good tannic structure, yet has immediate appeal. Finishes long, dark and handsome.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"za","description":"The bouquet of this Cabernet-Shiraz-Merlot-Ruby Cabernet blend shows intriguing berry, mint, anise, earth and tobacco-herb aromas. Bright acidity keeps the berry fruit lively, and the finish is long and earthy.

Orange and mineral aromas give way to a dry, even palate in this tasty, medium-weight wine. Good acidity and a slight spiciness on the finish make this a great food wine and an unusual white. Worth the hunt.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"it","description":"Always a bit funky and unusual, this blend of 70% Catarrotto, a native Sicilian white grape, and 30% Chardonnay is mildly viscous but still quite fresh. It offers a medium-weight mouthfeel and a good amount of apple-driven flavor. Not hugely complex, but works as an apritif or with fettucine Alfredo, baked salmon or grilled veggies. And as reliably out of the mainstream as it is, it's also a perennial value. Give it a shot; there's nothing not to like about it.","province":"Sicily & Sardinia"},{"country":"au","description":"Cinnamon-clove aromas on the nose. The wine has dry tannins in the mouth, and very solid, taut cherry and plum fruit, with dusty pencil-eraser accents. Would pair well with grilled food, or just about anything in barbecue sauce.","province":"South au"},{"country":"cl","description":"Fresh off the boat, this youthful SB pitches a no-hitter's worth of pungent grapefruit, passion fruit, cucumber and thistle. Seems to be shooting for the nz style, but it's true-blue Casablanca Sauvignon. Crisp as stones and zesty, with a hint of pickle on the finish.","province":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A pretty wine, spicy and rich, with an array of vibrantly fruity flavors ranging from sweet citrus through apples and peaches to exotic mango. Winemaker bells and whistles such as barrel fermentation and lees add creamy, vanilla, buttered toast notes.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"In attempting to reach for just a bit of extra flavor the wine has gone slightly over the top, but offers many near-term pleasures. A plush mix of stewed fruits, sweet plum and mince pie smoothes into a seductive, lush middle before hitting a wall of tannin on the way out.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"Very light yellow in the glass, with light floral/fresh meadow aromas to match. White meat and pear fruit is weighty on the front palate, and fades into a bright herbal-steeliness on the finish. Not hugely fat or mouthcoating. It's just the right size, and rather interesting at that.","province":"New South Wales"},{"country":"US","description":"A nice Cab that mingles its polished berry-cherry flavors with earthy tobacco and mocha to make for a dry, very drinkable wine.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a firm structure to the fruit, which is elaborate in plummy, blackberry and mocha flavors. Will hold for a few years, but it's best to drink it in its youthful freshness.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"Grner Veltliner is at's own special whiteit's fresh, but peppery, aromatic, spicy and flowery. This example has all those flavors, and is a bargain, too. It comes from one of the world's great cooperatives. The fruit comes from the terraced vineyards of the Wachau region in the Danube Valley. The term Federspiel is used in the Wachau to denote a good everyday wine, and this is exactly that.","province":"Wachau"},{"country":"it","description":"Starts off nicely, with aromatic notes of cinnamon, graham cracker and mint. There's some solid cherry fruit in the mouth, but it gets a little swamped by oaky notes of cedar and vanilla, finishing with soft tannins and tart acids. The barrique-aged blend is approximately 50% Nebbiolo, 40% Barbera and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"au","description":"This reasonably priced Riesling shows trading-card bubblegumpowder and white peach aromas. Firm white peach and citrus flavors are couched in a round, amply sized feel. A very good wine, from an always reliable producer.","province":"South au"},{"country":"au","description":"With such abyss-deep black aromas (steak, pepper, licorice) the palate, by not knocking you out with giant tannins and lots of charred oak, feels slender in comparison. This is a pleasing balance of smooth tannins, and pretty black plum and blueberry flavors.","province":"South au"},{"country":"it","description":"Solid, with restrained red fruit, tea, fallen leaves and leather on the nose. Old school all the way, with raspberry and black cherry flavors and little to no perceivable oak. It expands nicely on the finish, offering a glance into the lighter style of Chianti.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"ar","description":"Dense and dark, with a color akin to purple ink. Catchy, well-made, the fruit is ripe and abnormally friendly, while the structure is solid. What makes this an above-average wine in its class is that the acidity is mellow, not shrill as is often the case.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"it","description":"Burnt-match aromas meld with burnt coffee on the nose, lending a slightly off note to this otherwise very fine wine. Black cherry and mushroom flavors are wrapped in a soft, supple package that reflects the great ripeness achieved in the 2000 vintage.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"za","description":"Bright, focused classic orange-apricot Muscat aromas and flavors shine in this fortified wine from Paarl. Though light in feel, it shows a little heatno surprise with its 18% alcohol. Refreshing very cold from the nose right through the tangy citrus-spice close.","province":"Paarl"},{"country":"fr","description":"The heat-drenched 2003 vintage has given this wine far more weight and flesh than is typical. Although this may turn off some Muscadet fans, it gives folks who haven't yet discovered Muscadet a relatively easy introduction to the genre. It's filled with soft stone fruit and melon flavors, but it still retains the briny, minerally soul of its appellation and a lingering finish.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This one's super-dry and tight in acids and displays citrus flavors. You might think it was Sauvignon Blanc, except for the peacock's tail of white peach and mango on the finish. A great food wine.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Light and open, but with purity and more power than normal. Starts with lime and citrus pith and finishes with grip, an acid wave, and some white pepper. Long on the back end for Orvieto, and well made.","province":"Central it"},{"country":"US","description":"Cherry, berry and herb flavors are buried inside bigtime tannins that numb the palate, in this dry, smoothly textured wine. It's questionable whether the wine has enough stuffing for the cellar.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This reliable producer makes a pleasant, lightweight but solid, mainstream Merlot. The fruit is on the strawberry/red currant end of the spectrum, light but flavorful. It's dusted with cocoa/baking chocolate barrel flavors.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Very juicy, fruity and showing a lot of tangy citrus flavors. This is a fruit-loaded wine, pleasing and forward, but lacking much stuffing or follow-through.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"This reliable Barolo producer has turned out a balanced Moscato from a ferociously hot vintage. Apricot, honey and pink grapefruit aromas and flavors all swirl together in a harmonious whole that's not profound, simply very enjoyable.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"Sassy and saucy, with raisin, blueberry, pepper and earth aromas. Kent Rosenblum has crafted a wine that, within its class, is well above average, and we challenge you to find Zin this authentic for this price. What it lacks in nuance is made up for in girth and guts. It's chewy and rich, and it becomes more complex with each minute spent in the glass. Nothing weedy or green here, and the mouthfeel rocks.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Lots to like in this ultra- dry wine, with its soothingly rich tannins and flavors of wild berries, peppery spices and herbs, and earthy tobacco. Could have a bit more concentration, but it's quintessential Sonoma Zin.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This very ripe, slightly stewed wine runs right at you with full-out fruit flavors, soft and open.

Sure, it's a little on the simple side, but it's fun to drink and would make a great pizza wine.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"fr","description":"When my wife, normally no great fan of ros, says, I really like this wine, that's an endorsement you can take to the bank. Aromas of wild berries and melon are reserved, the punch solid, and the color a lovely light salmon.

Excellent with salads topped with vinaigrettes.","province":"Provence"},{"country":"ar","description":"Begins with leather, earth and stewed plum aromas.

Flavors of plum, berry and rhubarb are lively, accented by a touch of milk chocolate.","province":"Other"},{"country":"US","description":"A nicely balanced wine that might compare to a particularly ripe sp?tlese, with just a hint of honeyed botrytis. A balanced palate mixing citrus blossom, apples and lightly roasted almonds.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"Not the best vintage  for Sassicaia enthusiasts or collectors, but certainly noteworthy thanks to defined herbal aromas such as rosemary and sage backed by black plum, black berry, tobacco, cigar box and leather. The mouthfeel is velvety and supple with unmistakable elegance delivered over a long, menthol-like finish.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"es","description":"A single-estate Albari?o with clean minerality accenting flowery, grassy aromas. In the mouth, it'sforward and finely chiseled, with pure apple, papaya and saline flavors. Not run of the mill, and for that we like it a lot.","province":"Galicia"},{"country":"it","description":"A slight opening on the nose houses flowery red fruit; it's decidedly not a dark, heavy wine. But it does show some oak. The palate is hard-driving, with firm tannins supporting zesty, almost racy fruit. Nothing manipulated here; just ripe, ready rosso.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"it","description":"Dark and tight, with toasted, masculine aromas that hint at barrique aging.

A forward wine that should please most fans of Tuscan Sangiovese.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"it","description":"This wine is deeply toasted, boasting almost campfire-like notes lavished over aromas of prune, blackberry, tobacco, leather and a hint of cherry liqueur.

Stylish but forward; it's a wine most anyone should like.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Huge wine, young and tannic, almost bitter now and not offering much relief. But of course you don't buy Beringer PR tonight.

A mouthwatering finish just adds to the package.","province":"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer"},{"country":"it","description":"Tenuta Sette Ponti's internationally styled blend is heavy and dense, a mirror image of the hot '03 vintage.

There's noticeable acid and some interesting grace notes, suggestive of flint and gun metal. The flavors linger pleasantly in the back of the throat.

Simple fruit flavors suggest grapefruit and fresh cut slices of orange.

It's competent but not up to the gorgeous scents and flavors of the past four or five vintages.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"cl","description":"A direct reflection of cl's cool and wet '02 vintage.

With the vines recovering from a bad freeze, Pepper Bridge fruit presented some challenges in 2005.

It is very dark and lavishly oaked, aged in 100% new French barrels. The immediate aroma is of vanilla and toast, while the palate experience is of oak and dry tannins that numb the palate through the finish.

The white pear and almond flavors seem to sit on top of this dense wine, which will need to age. It reflects the super-rich side of white Burgundy in 2005.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"fr","description":"A limited production wine from Labour-Roi's own vineyards, this is powerful and ripe, but tempered with refreshing acidity. With its spice and ginger flavors, it rolls richly around the mouth, and then finishes crisp and fresh.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"This is very fresh and crisp, mingling light citrus and green apple fruit with interesting herbal enticements of white pepper and tarragon. Just a touch (6%) of Viognier in the blend adds to the citrus and floral highlights.

The grapes tend to get a little baked this far inland, especially Merlot, which really needs just the right conditions to maintain delicacy and balance.

The tannins, needless to say, are soft, and the acidity is low.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The aromas are watery and very faint, suggestive of kiwi, lime and vanilla.

But you wouldn't know it, as it has elegant flavors of ripe cherry, plum and chocolate in a beautifully balanced framework.

The cherries, oak and tannins suggest a good grilled steak.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Smoky and dark, with blackberry as the main fruit-based aroma.

Blackberry and black cherry fruit is lifted by some lemony acids. The challenge for these Rogue Valley Syrahs is to flesh out the midpalate fruit and keep the tannins in check.

In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins.

The aromas differ from the norm; there's spearmint, licorice gumdrops, herbs and tobacco. Nice and distinctive at all points: clean raspberry fruit, dusty tannins on the finish, and a peppery streak. A few years will bring it together even more.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Tight red fruit and a solid whack of oak make for a fine wine.

An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"es","description":"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums.

Silky and delicate in the mouth, but the flavors fade a little too quickly on the finish.","province":"Martinborough"},{"country":"za","description":"Flavors of white stone fruits, peach pit and spicy oak are a surprise after a modest nose of melon.

Starts out with complex, oaky aromas of ripe peaches, cashew butter, wildflowers, spice and cream, and tastes opulent and plush. The dominant flavors are ripe tree fruits, like apricot and peach, but it's very dry and well balanced. There's something unusually creamy in the finish.","province":"Victoria"},{"country":"US","description":"A show-off wine, with multiple layers of aromatic and flavor complexity. Starts with an herbal, mountain-style fragrance before turning soft and smooth in the mouth, with an undercurrent of beet root, blueberry and wood.

Fans of rustic, hedonistic California experiences will get a charge out of it.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"Now this is NZ Sauvignon Blanc. Classic gooseberry and grapefruit aromas give way to zesty citrus fruit and a long grapefruity finish tinged with slightly bitter pith notes.","province":"Martinborough"},{"country":"nz","description":"Very ripe and soft-smelling, featuring tropical fruits, butter and vanilla. Gets more interesting in the mouth, with lime-like acidity to give it definition, and plump guavas, mangos and pineapples that caress your palate.

Best after 2008, but fine now with a rich duck presentation.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"It must be the coolness of the estate, because even in this hot vintage, this wine is dry, tannic and relatively moderate in alcohol.

Fine now, and should hold and improve for a good ten years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The most complete and compelling of Diamond Creek's trio of '02s, combining the opulent accessibility of Gravelly Meadow with the power and authority of Volcanic Hill. The aromas of cassis, red currants, cedar, tobacco and cigar box lead to massively packed Cabernet flavors wrapped in huge, dusty tannins. The wine is so balanced, so distinguished and complete.

A gorgeous Pinot Noir that superbly combines power with elegance.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Starts off as a closed, tight wine, aromatically speaking, and needs plenty of decanting to breathe, but once it starts to open, there's an eruption of the most refined cassis and cedar aromas. In the mouth, this is an immense Cabernet, profoundly deep in blackberry, roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors. It is also enormously tannic, and is effectively locked down. Nowhere near ready, although decanting will help it, but it's best to hold this magnificent wine until 2007, when it should start to open, and then for at least 10 additional years.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"Smoky aromas mix with scents of green herbs in an offering that's reminiscent of some Chinons.

It's clean and sharp, thanks to high acidity.

The cured meat and tobacco notes don't exactly connect with the sweet-tart fruit. Unlike all the black-fruit-driven Shirazes, this one is basically cherries and plums. The finish is fresh and short, and here the tannins really show their teeth.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Fans of upfront fruit will have problems with this earthy, tannic wine. Fresh out of the bottle, the aromas are of cherry tomatoes and herbs, and the wine tastes loamy and herbaceous.

Great now.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Bob Lindquist's 1999 offering displays a lovely opening of tropical fruit and vanilla custard beneath a smoky veil. The palate's understated nectarine, pear, pineapple flavors are bolstered by firm but not sharp acidity. The mouthfeel is crisp; the wine's fine structure shows through the tangy, nut-pepper finish. Already impressive, but warrants cellaring for two or three years. Top Value.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"An intoxicating bouquet of clove, ripe orange, peach and melon promises a lot, but this wine delivers.

It pushes all the right sensory buttons, with big body and great lines, like a '56 Buick.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Joseph Phelps's flagship Chardonnay is a study in sophisticated style. A fragrant peach, pineapple, smoke and floral bouquet might, in other wines, be overpowering, but here it is subtly seductive.

Only die-hard anti-oaksters will be able to resist its appeal.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Another elegant wine from Cambria. This one has a vanilla, smoke and grapefruit nose. Medium-weight, it is crisp in the mouth, though somewhat leaner than the Bench Break.

A daring, not gently nuanced, wine.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This plush Chardonnay's bouquet shows an ultraripe botrytis note in its vanilla, peach, clove and caramel aromas.

Golden yellow in color, it shows ultraripe fruit that smells of apricots, peaches and pine. The fruit supports a lot of oak. Winemaker Marty Clubb has a great touch with this often-overlooked grape. As good as it is, the '99 still seems less complex than the spectacular '98.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The '98 Klipsun, from a premier vineyard on Red Mountain, is even better than the '97.

Plenty of plush, opulent fruit (blackberry and currant) and high-quality oak, and it tastes terrific. It has that pinpoint, laser-like quality you find in good wine.

This one does its best, with modest aromas of black-cherry fruit accentuated by oak, but there's a green weediness throughout that age will not soften.

The aromas are dull; they don't shine. The flavors are good, though. Sharply etched fruit forces itself on the palate, ripe, sweet and brimming with sunshine. This is simple, everyday stuff, but it's clean as a whistle and has a good amount of charm. Definitely a value in Merlot.

Maybe this wine shows why. It has that Napa pedigree of fruit, but there are disturbing notes of imbalance. Some of the flavors are ripe and juicy; others are overripe and pruny, while still others are immature and green or stalky. The result is disappointing.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Quite round and fruity, this easy drinker is almost sweet. Displaying tropical fruit, honey and pear-nectar aromas and flavors, it turns warmly spicy on the finish.

A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a nice, refreshing wine very close in profile to Chardonnay, with its ripe peach aromas and flavors and generous dose of oak. It has a strong streak of tangerine and vanilla that makes it especially pretty. Finishes a bit sweet.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"This individualistic Chardonnay has a lot to offer. The nose is ripe, with floral, honey and even petrol notes and opens to a palate of tangerine and lychee nut-like flavors.  The mouthfeel is round and smooth; the sweet and sour finish, dry and spicy. Reminiscent of some Alsatian whites and worthy of notice for its flavorful uniqueness.","province":"Maule Valley"},{"country":"it","description":"This unique red sparkler from Piedmont offers cherry and earth aromas before turning lighter on the palate, with slightly sweet strawberry flavors and a soft mousse.  Aunique wine, the finish has nice length and appealingly full fruit flavors that have appeal even to serious wine drinkers.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"it","description":"This 100% Cortese wine has a slight fizz and an almost imperceptibly faint touch of sweetness.

A crisp mouthfeel and classic Gavi almond, lime and smoke notes close this pleaser.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"A great price for a wine this rich and spicy. It's busting with ripe tropical fruit, peach, tangerine and pear notes, and spices, too. And it's dry, with just a hint of residual sugar to make the fruit round and forward.

The grapes obviously had no trouble ripening, and offer waves of blackberries, plums and black currants, not to mention spices like fennel and pepper. Very dry and fancy, this wine could sit on the best tables and not hang its head. Best Buy.","province":"Central Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"A refreshing wine, with nicely ripened fruit and exceptional balance, that's pleasant in every way and a super value, too.

Gobs of freshly crushed blackberries, blueberries, plums, espresso, black currants and vanilla are charming, and the flavors are every bit as lush.

Bright acidity keeps it lively and it finishes dry with a classy, slightly chalky note.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A little earthy, with plummy aromas accompanied by sun-dried tomato, rhubarb and hard spice notes.

It's crisp and ultraclean, and a good value.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"If you didn't know the price and had to guess, you'd probably figure this wine would cost about $18.

A wine of enormous charm and a great value in Chardonnay.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Slightly fat, figgy aromas, with notes of thyme and mint, give way to a round palate and flavors of citrus and fig.

What stands out is the depth of flavor.","province":"Central Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"There's very juicy, jammy red berry fruit here and the round, even soft palate may lack a bit of structure, but this is a flavorful, very approachable wine. Slight tobacco and cocoa notes add interest and keep it from being just fruity. Cabernet flavors in a Beaujolais-weight package.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"This is a very distinctive, even eccentric, Cab that must reflect its single-vineyard terroir.  The usual black-currant and blackberry notes are there, but the aroma is sharply dominated by an herbal streak, somewhat stalky or green, as if some of the grapes didn't ripen.  Tastes a little sharp.  Purists might want to age it for 3-5 years to see if it softens up.","province":"Aconcagua Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Young and grapy, with plenty of heavily toasted oak, this is one Chilean red that could use a year or so to settle down. Right now the fruit is just too unformed and the charred oak too unintegrated, but the solid raw materials should knit together nicely in a relatively short time.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Boasts a reasonably complex bouquet of chocolate, cedar and weedy cassis, followed by a mellow, soft palate impression.

No, there's not a lot of structure, but why age a wine that's so clearly made for immediate gratification?","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Richly fruity and soft, this wine boasts loads of black-cherry and plum flavors. Clearly made from very ripe fruit, it lacks the herbaceous-vegetal character so often found in Merlot, but also any sense of structure. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat.","province":"Rapel Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"This is a well-made wine, correct in all respects but decidely light for a Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps a reflection of the difficult 1998 (La Ni?a) vintage. However, its attractive flavor package and appraochable structure make for easy drinking with tonight's pasta or pizza.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word fruit. It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"A good everyday Chardonnay, this wine's apple and toasted oak notes are supported by brisk acidity and a smooth but lively mouthfeel.

Apple and toasted oak start things off and are followed by crisp acidity and a smooth mouthfeel, However, the finish is short and the oak somewhat overbearing.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Ripe pear-pineapple fruit is layered with vanilla and tinged with citrus. This is a plump, slightly heavy Chard best served cold at parties and picnics.","province":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Tropical fruit flavors abound throughout in this balanced, straightforward wine. Simple yet attractive, it can be used as an apertif or for casual dining. Spicy shellfish dishes, especially coconut shrimp, would pair well with this.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"A light Chardonnnay showing  pineapple and pear aromas, and similar flavors that turn quite lemony on the palate.

Which makes it a good Merlot value, even though the score isn't very high.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"With a bouquet of dark plum and toasty oak, with an earthy barnyardy note, this wine from this older Bordeaux grape still cultivated in cl has medium weight and some plum and caramel flavors.

It's a bit rough around the edges but is well made and gets the job done.","province":"Central Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"From the folks who invented white Zinfandel, a freshly fruity, soft, slightly sweet wine with high enough acidity to keep it from palling. The color is pale pink, and the aromas recall red raspberries and peaches.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Everything is front-end in this Chardonnay. The nose has plenty of tropical fruit, and with some toasted oak in the background.

It continues the disguise with its cherry and oak flavors, rather light mouthfeel and lack of density for a Cabernet based wine.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Lots of cedar is evident on the nose and palate of this red blend. The berry and cassis aromas and flavors are a bit hard to discern and also bear a too-prominent minty, slightly herbaceousness. This medium weight wine closes with a dry tart woodiness that lacks mass appeal.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A heavy wine, atypical of the appellation, which usually produces light-bodied and elegant Pinots.
