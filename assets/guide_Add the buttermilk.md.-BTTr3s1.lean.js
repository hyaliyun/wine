This step can be done the day before dinner. Peel and cut the citrus fruit into sections over a plate. Drain the juice from the plate into a bowl. Season liberally with gray salt and black pepper. Whisk in olive oil to form a vinaigrette (it should be in proportion, about 2 parts juice to 1 part olive oil). Season citrus sections with salt and pepper. Drizzle a little of the vinaigrette on them to marinate and put them on a platter. Have your fishmonger peel the prawns but leave the tails on for handles. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Preheat a saute pan on high. Dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture. This will give them a nice crust and allow them to stay crispy and fresh at room temperature. Add olive oil to the pan and put in 1 layer of shrimp. You want them to caramelize, so don&#39;t toss or move them. Add a little more oil if the flour absorbs what&#39;s in the pan. After about 3 minutes, turn over the prawns. Let it caramelize, toss and turn out onto a cookie sheet. Add about 1/4 cup more olive oil to the already hot saute pan. Drain pan juices from the cookie sheet into the saute pan. Add sliced garlic and let it get light brown. Add chiles and let them get soft. Add the basil and stand back - there&#39;s a lot of water in basil and it will pop. Let it get crispy, less than a minute. While this is happening, arrange prawns over the citrus salad. Add the orange zest to the basil/garlic/cl mixture in the saute pan. Season with salt and pepper, then spoon basil/garlic/cl mixture over the prawns. Toss the spinach with the citrus vinaigrette and mound on top of the prawns.

The molds I used are decorative and easy to unmold because they are flexible. All you are doing in this recipe is freezing water. Select flexible silicone molds to create the sculpture base and cake stand. I used 3 molds. For the sculpture base, I used a small sunflower and centered it in the mold (place flowers upside down). When the flower is in place, fill the mold 1/3 full with water. Place the mold in the freezer. If all of the water is added at this time, the flower will float to the top. When the water has frozen, remove the mold from the freezer and add more water so the mold is 2/3&#39;s full. Return the mold to the freezer. The mold must be filled in stages to keep the previously frozen ice from floating to the top of the mold. When the additional water is frozen, remove from the freezer, fill the mold with water and return to the freezer. Repeat these steps using the other molds and use any flowers or fresh leaves to decorate your sculpture. Apply the same technique to plastic water bottle that has been cut to size. This can be the column that supports the other ice bases. When all of the pieces have been frozen, use a box grater or a wood plainer to flatten the surface of the mold. It is especially important to flatten the spot where 2 pieces are joined together. Sprinkle a little of the ice shaving on the spot. Wet with a little water and immediately \\glue\\ 2 pieces together. Put the whole sculpture back in the freezer until ready to use. When the entire mold is frozen, it is ready to be displayed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 37524,&quot;Hoisin Marinated Grilled Chicken 2 Cornish game hens, halved 1 cup hoisin sauce 2 cups red wine 1/2 bunch scallions, chopped 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, chopped 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 tablespoon sesame oil Instructions: Place the hens in a baking dish.

While the potatoes are baking, prepare the filling. Saute the onion and carrots in the oil or ghee until they are tender, for about 10 minutes. Add the bell pepper and spices and continue to saute for another minute or two, stirring. Add a little water to the pan to prevent sticking, cover it, and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the bell pepper is just tender. Stir in the cream cheese and add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. When the potatoes are baked and cool enough to handle, make a lengthwise cut in the top of each one and scoop out a least half of the contents. If you are using large potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise and scoop them out, leaving about 1/2 inch of potato clinging to the skin. Mash the scoopedout potato and then add it to the vegetablecream cheese mixture. Lower the oven heat to 350 degrees. Fill the potato shells with this mixture and place them in an oiled baking dish.

Combine the beets, 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 teaspoon salt, some pepper, 5 of the thyme sprigs and the garlic cloves on a baking sheet. Cover with foil and roast for 30 to 35 minutes, until easily pierced with a paring knife. Set aside to cool completely. Meanwhile, toast the pistachios in the oven for 5 minutes. Let cool. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan or lidded deep skillet over medium heat. Add the farro and toast for 2 minutes--the color will darken slightly and the farro will acquire a nutty fragrance. Add 2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt and the remaining 5 thyme sprigs. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 25 minutes, or until al dente (cooked but still firm to the bite). Drain the farro well and pour into a serving bowl. While the farro is still hot, add the beet greens, tossing to allow the heat to wilt the greens. Set aside to cool completely. With a paper towel, remove the skins from the beets. Quarter the beets and add them to the bowl with the farro. Fold in the toasted pistachios. Squeeze the roasted garlic into a small bowl. Mash with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Add the vinegar and then whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Adjust the seasoning as desired.

Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 4 hours. To make the filling, process all of the filling ingredients in a food processor bowl until mixture is smooth and blended. Remove 1 pastry square from the refrigerator. Set a side for 10 minutes before rolling it. On a floured work surface, roll the pastry into a rectangle until less than 1/8-inch thick. With a ruler and a pastry wheel, trim the ragged edges and then cut the pastry into 3-inch squares. Lay the pastry squares across the top of an un-greased 12-cup miniature muffin pan, each cup measuring 1 1/2 inches across and 3/4 inch deep, centering each square over one cup. Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of filling on each square, then bring opposite corners to the center and press lightly to seal. This process will also ease the pastry into each cup. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Roll and shape the remaining pastry squares in the same fashion. Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Bake 2 or 3 pans at a time for about 20 to 25 minutes or until pastries are light brown. Remove pan from oven to a wire rack for about 10 minutes. Remove pastries from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Sift powdered sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle pastries before serving at room temperature. If not serving the same day, stack the pastries in airtight plastic containers and freeze for up to 2 weeks. To serve, reheat to freshen in a 325 degree preheated oven for about 7 to 12 minutes or until warm, cool slightly, and decorate with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Put the flour and salt in a 3-quart bowl, and stir to blend. Scatter the butter slices over the flour, and cut in with a pastry blender until the mixture consists of particles that vary in size from small peas to bread crumbs. Stir in the sour cream with a fork. The pastry will appear dry because the sour cream is thick and does not disperse easily. With your hands, manipulate dough into a ball. Divide dough as recipe directs. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 4 hours and up to 3 days.

For the white chocolate popcorn: Set up a double boiler. Add the white chocolate and stir to melt. Whisk in the coconut oil, then set aside to cool. Place the popped popcorn onto a sheet pan lined with a silicone mat. Pour the white chocolate evenly over the popcorn and sprinkle with smoked sea salt. Place into the freezer to chill for at least 10 minutes, or until the chocolate is set. Remove from the freezer and break into pieces. For the butterscotch crme br?le: In a medium saucepan, add in the heavy cream, instant espresso powder and vanilla bean paste. Bring to a light simmer for 15 minutes. Take off the heat and cool for 15 minutes. In a non-reactive bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar until combined and lighter in color. Slowly add in the heated cream mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the mixture into twelve 8-ounce ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with the hot water, making sure not to get the crme wet. Bake until the crme is set and just a teensy bit jiggly, 40 minutes. Place into the fridge for at least 2 hours to cool. If storing longer (up to 2 days) tightly wrap each ramekin to ensure freshness.

On a floured surface, roll the pastry 3/8-inch thick and line a 10-inch flan ring with it. Place the ring on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and chill it until needed. Cream the butter and sugar lightly in an electric mixer; don&#39;t let the butter get too soft. Add the eggs and mix lightly. Stir in the liqueur, zest, and almond extract, then mix in the ground almonds. Pour into the chilled pastry shell and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the pastry and marzipan are a deep golden brown. Remove the tart from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Brush the top of the tart with the currant jelly. Cover the top of the tart with sliced strawberries arranged in concentric circles or in a flower petal design, making certain the whole top of the tart is covered.

Sugar Dough: 1 pound unsalted butter, slightly softened 3 1/3 cups (12 ounces) pastry flour 3 1/3 cups (12 ounces) all-purpose flour Pinch salt 3/4 cup (6 ounces) sugar 3 egg yolks 2 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream Cut the butter into large pieces and place the pieces in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or dough hook. Add the pastry and all-purpose flour, salt, and sugar. Mix on low speed until the butter is evenly distributed throughout the flour. Add the egg yolks and cream. Continue to mix on low speed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough and divide it into 2 pieces. Flatten each piece into a 6-inch round. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight. Use as needed. The dough will remain fresh for 2 or 3 days in the refrigerator; or wrap securely in plastic, then in foil, and it will keep frozen for 2 to 3 months. Note: The dough may also be made in a food processor using the same technique, but make half a batch at a time for best results. To prepare the dough by hand, place the flours, sugar and salt in a large bowl or on a work surface. Mix together. Cut in the butter with your fingertips. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour in the egg yolks and cream. Using your fingertips, quickly work in the flour until the dough holds together. Form the dough into rounds, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill.

Make them as spicy or mild as you like. Preheat the broiler. In a very hot skillet, add a bit of canola oil and the Braised Beef Brisket. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, and then flip and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Next, pour some of the red sauce over the meat to make it nice and moist. If you have them, also add a bit of the pan drippings from the brisket-cooking process (or a bit of beef broth--again just enough to bring the meat to a nice moist consistency). Stir to combine and remove from the heat. To assemble: In a heatproof dish, layer half of the tortilla chips, beans, brisket, cheese and Pico de Gallo. Repeat the layers but leave off the second layer of Pico de Gallo until after the dish is cooked. Place on the middle or bottom rack of your oven and broil until the cheese is melted. Watch closely so they don&#39;t burn. Sprinkle the remaining Pico de Gallo over the top before serving. Inhale, exhale and then ravenously consume! Rinse the beans in cool water; pour into a pot and cover with water by 2 to 3 inches. Cut the bacon into large pieces and add to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover. Simmer until the beans are tender, about 2 hours, adding water to the pot as needed. (The beans should have a thick broth.) Toward the end of the cooking time, add 1 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Check the seasoning before serving, and add more salt and pepper if desired. Don&#39;t over-salt. Combine the beef consomme, soy sauce, lemon juice, liquid smoke and garlic in a large roasting pan (a disposable is just fine). Place the brisket in the marinade, fat-side up. Cover tightly with foil. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Cook the brisket in the foil-covered pan until fork-tender, about 40 minutes per pound (6 to 7 hours). Transfer to a cutting board, slice against the grain and put the slices back into the cooking liquid. Serve immediately, spooning the juice over the slices. You may store the pan in the fridge for up to 2 days, or freeze for use at a later date. If fat collects and hardens at the top, remove and discard. Chop the tomatoes, jalapenos and onions into a very small dice. (Leave the seeds in your jalapenos for a hotter pico.) Adjust the amount of jalapenos to your preferred temperature. Next, chop up a nice-sized bunch of cilantro. Just remove and discard the long leafless stems before chopping. No need to remove the leaves from the stems completely. Put the tomatoes, jalapenos, onions and cilantro together in a bowl and give it a good stir. Squeeze the juice of the lime half into the bowl.

This will take about 15 to 20 minutes so be patient. Use small amount of water to help release the sugars that will stick to the bottom of the pan. Add all other ingredients and bring up to a warm temperature*. Remove from the stove and puree with a hand blender or food processor. Season with salt and pepper. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.

For the shortbread: Line an 8-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, making sure to leave several inches of overhang on each side to lift out the shortbread (or use a rectangular tart mold with removable bottom). Cream together the sugar and butter, using an electric mixer on medium speed, until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in the vanilla, and then the flour and salt. The dough will be crumbly, pea-size balls. Dust your fingers in flour, evenly distribute the crumbles throughout the dough, and then press evenly into the pan and the edges, forming a smooth dough. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Bake until the shortbread is a nice golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool the crust completely in the pan set over a wire rack. For the maple butter: Bring the maple syrup to a boil, without stirring, in a small high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook the syrup, lowering the heat to medium if it begins to foam up to the top of the pot, until a candy thermometer reaches 235 degrees F to 240 degrees F (113 to 116 degrees C), soft-ball stage, about 15 minutes. Place the saucepan in a basin or bowl of ice water. Let cool, without stirring, until the thermometer reads about 120 degrees F (50 degrees C), 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the water. Beat the syrup, using a hand-held electric mixer on medium-high speed, until creamy, light in color (like peanut butter) and thickened, about 5 minutes. Continue to stir the maple syrup using a wooden spoon until it has lightened a few more shades, lost some of its sheen and slowly oozes off the spoon. Spread the maple butter over the cooled crust. Top with the toasted pecans and gently press into the maple butter. Sprinkle with sea salt. Set the pan aside for 30 minutes so the maple butter can set. It will change from a shiny finish to a dull, matte finish. Gently lift out of the pan and cut into 24 pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 37578,&quot;Mahi Mahi Breakfast Margarine or butter, for flat grill 14 ounces mahi mahi, cut into 4 pieces Garlic and herb seasoning Instructions: Oil the flat grill top with margarine or butter.

In another bowl add the pineapple and the 3/4 cup of rum. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, add 1 3/4 sticks butter and the sugar and cream together until pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Stir in the eggs 1 at a time. Add the vanilla extract and set aside. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir until a smooth batter forms. In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, over medium heat, add the remaining 1/4 stick butter and heat until the butter has just melted. Add the brown sugar and using a slotted spoon, add the pineapple pieces, reserving the rum. Saute until they begin to caramelize, about 4 minutes. Add the cherries and the rum they soaked in. Remove the skillet from the heat and light the rum with a long kitchen match. When the flames subside, return the pan to the heat and cook until most of the alcohol has evaporated. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside to cool 6 to 10 minutes before adding the batter. Remove half the fruit back into the reserved rum for garnishing later. Add the batter to the skillet and put in the oven. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Add the remaining 8 tablespoons butter, and pulse until you have pea-sized pieces. Sprinkle the vodka and water over the mixture, and pulse until the dough just comes together. Evenly divide the dough between 2 pieces of plastic wrap, and gently press or pat into rounds. Wrap tightly, and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour up to overnight. (The dough can be frozen for up to 2 months.) For the filling: Peel and core the apples, then cut them into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Toss with the sugar and lemon juice in a large bowl. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the firmer apples soften but hold their shape, 15 to 18 minutes. (The softer apples, like McIntosh, will get very soft and saucy.) Add the flour, cinnamon, cream and salt, and stir until the juices thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, and let cool completely. (The filling can be refrigerated, covered, up to 2 days ahead.) To assemble: Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 13-inch round on a lightly floured surface or between 2 pieces of floured parchment or wax paper. (If the dough gets too warm, refrigerate it to firm it up.) Ease it into a deep 9 1/2-inch pie pan. Mound the cooled filling slightly in the center of the dough, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round. Place it over the filling, and press the 2 crusts together around the edge. Fold the overhanging dough under itself, and crimp as desired. Brush the top and edges with heavy cream, and sprinkle generously with sugar. Pierce the top with a knife a few times (or make decorative cutouts) to let steam escape. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. To bake: Position an oven rack in the bottom slot of the oven, set a baking sheet on it and preheat to 425 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet, and lower the heat to 375 degrees F. Bake until the pie is golden and the filling is bubbly, 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes, rotating as needed. (Cover the edge of the crust with foil if it browns too quickly.) Transfer to a rack, and let cool until set, 3 hours. Serve the cooled pie, or wrap it tightly in foil, label and date, and freeze for up to 2 weeks.

Meanwhile, click here to e-mail a link of the template to your desktop or laptop computer for printing. Print the file at 100% on letter size paper and cut out the pieces. Remove the top sheet of parchment from the dough. Lay the templates on the rolled dough slabs and cut out all the pieces with a long, sharp knife or pizza cutter. (You will have a total of 8 cut panels plus 3 extra sheets for cookies. Cut out the remaining dough with cookie cutters of your choice.) Cut a 2- by 3-inch door with a rounded top into one of the tall walls. (We used a 2 inch cookie cutter to make the rounded top, and a sharp knife to cut the rest of the door out.) Stack panels on a cookie sheet and chill 45 minutes to set. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position the oven racks evenly. Bake the gingerbread shapes until they are a rich tawny brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack. With a fine kitchen rasp, file the panels to make all the edges straight. Thicken about 2 cups of the Royal Icing with either cornstarch and a couple of drops of vinegar, or extra confectioners&#39; sugar, to get the consistency of caulk. Fit a pastry bag with a medium round tip and fill it with the thickened icing. Pipe a generous amount of Royal Icing along the bottom and the sides of a short wall. Center the wall 3/4 inch from one edge, directly<br> onto the base. Use a box or can to help support the walls while they dry. Pipe Royal Icing along the bottom of a tall wall, and stick it to the base with an edge pressed against the icing on the first wall. Repeat with the remaining two walls in the same manner until the four walls are up, making an open box with a 3/4-inch border all around the base. (The two tall walls will face each other.) Allow the icing to dry completely, about 24 hours, before attaching the roof. Ice the sloped edges on one side of the house and attach the big roof piece. (Line up the top of the roof with the peaks of the tall walls.) Use a box or can to prop up the overhang of the roof while it dries in place. Attach the smaller roof piece on the other side of the slope (prop it up with a box or can) leaving the same amount of overhang. Leave the top open for now. The last roof panel is the lid and will go there when all is dry. Attach the doors. Pipe Royal Icing neatly on the outside of the seams to secure them, and allow the house to dry for 24 hours. Fit tips into piping bags. Divide the remaining Royal Icing into batches and color as desired. Fill bags with frosting and decorate the house and roof with icing and candies if using. Allow to dry. Fill the house with cookies. Rest the remaining roof slab on the house to make a lid. Enjoy. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3/4cup water in a large bowl. Mix slowly with an electric mixer until stiff enough to form peaks; the icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is over beaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, and then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting. Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. Gels are best with royal icing. You don&#39;t want to thin them with liquid colors. Be careful of adding too much color, which reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days. Store the icing at room temperature, covered, with plastic wrap on the surface. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37603,&quot;Roasted Cauliflower Steaks with Raisin Relish 1/4 cup finely chopped roasted red peppers 2 tablespoons golden raisins, chopped 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 2 teaspoons capers, rinsed, drained and finely chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 small head cauliflower (about 2 pounds) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Combine the potatoes and leeks on a sheet pan in a single layer. Add the olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss to coat the vegetables evenly. Roast for 40 to 45 minutes, turning them with a spatula a few times during cooking, until very tender. Add the arugula and toss to combine. Roast for 4 to 5 more minutes, until the arugula is wilted. Remove the pan from the oven and place over 2 burners. Stir in the wine and 1 cup of the chicken stock and cook over low heat, scraping up any crispy roasted bits sticking to the pan. In batches, transfer the roasted vegetables to a food processor fitted with the steel blade, adding the pan liquid and about 5 cups of the chicken stock to make a puree. Pour the puree into a large pot or Dutch oven. Continue to puree the vegetables in batches until they&#39;re all done and combined in the large pot. Add enough of the remaining 1 to 2 cups of stock to make a thick soup. Add the cream, creme fraiche, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and check the seasonings. When ready to serve, reheat the soup gently and whisk in 2 tablespoons white wine and 1/4 cup of Parmesan. Serve hot with an extra grating of Parmesan and crispy shallots, if using. Heat the oil and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until it reaches 220 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Reduce the heat to low, add the shallots, and cook for 30 to 40 minutes, until they are a rich golden brown. The temperature should stay below 260 degrees F. Stir the shallots occasionally to make sure they brown evenly. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain well, and spread out to cool on paper towels. Once they have dried and crisped, they can be stored at room temperature, covered, for several days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 37609,&quot;Tahini Cinnamon Sweet Potatoes with Toasted Meringue 5 sweet potatoes (about 12 ounce or 340 grams each) 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup (60 grams) tahini<br> 3 tablespoons (45 grams) pure maple syrup<br> 2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 2 large egg whites, at room temperature<br> 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> 1/3 cup (110 grams) light corn syrup<br> 1/3 cup (40 grams) confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Let rest for 10 minutes. Heat a 7-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Brush it with a little of the remaining butter. Pour 2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan, swirling it so the batter evenly covers the bottom of the pan. The first one may not work out so just eat it. Repeat with the remaining butter and batter, stacking the finished crepes onto a plate. Preheat the broiler. Put a crepe on your work surface and run about 2 tablespoons of the chicken and gravy down the middle. Roll the crepe up and place it, seam side down, into a baking dish. When you have eight assembled, sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 1 to 2 minutes. Separate the chicken legs from the thighs, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Coat the pieces with the flour, shaking off any excess and reserve the leftover flour. Put the oil into a heavy bottomed skillet and heat it over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and brown it on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken to a plate and add the carrots, celery, onion, mushrooms, and corn. Sprinkle with the reserved flour, and give it a good stir. Add chicken broth and stir. Nestle the chicken pieces into the vegetables and add enough water to just cover the chicken. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before the cooking time is up combine the baking mix, poultry seasoning, and milk in a small bowl. Drop the batter by tablespoons on top of the simmering chicken leaving some room between the dumplings. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Serve hot. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until soft, about 6 minutes. Put 1/2 of the onion in a large bowl and the remainder in another bowl. In the large bowl add the beef, bread crumbs, grill seasoning, Worcestershire sauce and the egg. Mix to combine everything well and form the mixture into 5 oval patties. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties until they are well browned, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the steaks and pour off all but 2 tablespoons the fat. (The patties will not be cooked through and will finish cooking in the gravy.) Put the pan back on the heat, add the mushrooms, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the remaining onions, sprinkle in the flour, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the beef broth and bring it to a boil. Return the patties to the pan, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce has thickened and the steaks are cooked through, about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 37618,&quot;Breakfast Pizza Nonstick cooking spray One 11-ounce tube refrigerated thin-crust pizza dough<br> 1 stick unsalted butter, softened<br> 2 tablespoons everything bagel seasoning 1 cup whipped cream cheese<br> 4 ounces thinly sliced smoked salmon<br> 1 avocado, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 medium red onion, thinly sliced<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives<br> 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Heat the oil over medium heat until the thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and top with a wire cooling rack. Separate the biscuits, then cut each biscuit in half to create 16 half-moons. Use your fingers to separate the dough of a half-moon into 3 layers. With the rounded edge up, gently wrap one layer around a fingertip to create the center of the rose. Slide it off and then wrap a second layer around the center, trying to match the shape of a flower. Wrap the third layer around the blossom, using a fingertip to lightly press the rounded edges outward like petals. Give the base of the flower a light pinch to secure the layers together. If the dough has dried out slightly, dampen the base lightly with water and then pinch it. Repeat this process with the remaining half-moon pieces.\\u202f<br> Carefully lower the roses a few at a time into the hot oil. Be sure not to crowd the oil or the temperature will drop. Control the heat to maintain 325 degrees F. Fry until golden brown all over, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on the prepared cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining roses. Let the doughnuts cool completely, about 30 minutes.<br> Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, vanilla and rose water in a small bowl until incorporated. Dip each doughnut in the glaze and immediately sprinkle with dried rose petals.

Pour in 1/4 cup of chicken broth and blend to combine. Add more broth, if needed, for desired consistency. To make the chilaquiles: Pour about 1/3 cup vegetable oil into a large saute pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the tortillas, working in 2 or 3 batches, and cook until lightly browned and nearly crisp. Drain the tortillas on paper towels and discard the remaining oil. Wipe the pan with a paper towel. In the same pan, add the tomatillo salsa and bring to simmer over low heat. Add the tortillas and cook until soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Divide the mixture among 4 individual casserole dishes. Top with the cheese crumbles and onion rings. Drizzle with Mexican crema, sprinkle with some chopped fresh cilantro and serve immediately. *Cook&#39;s Note: Salsa Verde means \\green sauce\\ and is typically made with tomatillos, green chiles and cilantro. Make your own fresh, or you can also find it canned at most supermarkets. Tomatillos are a small green fruit encased in a tissue paper-like husk. They should be used when they are still green, before they are ripe and the husk has turned brown. Before using, remove the husk, rinse and dry the fruit. (They do not need to be seeded.) They are found in most supermarkets **Cook&#39;s Note: Chilaquiles is a Mexican brunch dish invented to use leftovers. It is made with day old tortillas (cut or torn into chips) and salsa verde. They are cooked together until the tortillas are slightly softened. Chilaquiles are eaten alone or with beans, eggs or shredded chicken. ***Cook&#39;s Note: Queso fresco is a white, mild, fresh Mexican cheese with the texture of fresh farmer&#39;s cheese in the US. Queso fresco can be found in many supermarkets, Latin specialty markets or online.

Sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper. Cook the steaks until they are brown but still rare in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the steaks to a plate and set aside to cool completely. Add 2 more tablespoons of olive oil to the same pan. Saute the onions and carrots until the onions are translucent, about 8 minutes, with additional salt and pepper, to taste. Add the garlic and oregano, and saute for 1 minute. Add the wine and simmer for 1 minute. Add the marinara sauce and broth. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat to allow the flavors to blend, about 10 minutes. Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, trim off any fat from the steaks, then cut the steaks into bite-size pieces and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the rigatoni and boil until it is tender but still firm to the bite, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Drain the rigatoni. Toss the rigatoni and reserved steak pieces and any accumulated juices from the steaks with the sauce to coat. Transfer the pasta to bowls. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese shavings and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 37667,&quot;Prosciutto Finger Sandwiches with Spicy Peach Jam 1 tablespoon sour cream 8 thin slices of good quality white bread 1/2 pound thinly sliced prosciutto 1/4 cup each finely chopped fresh tarragon, Italian flat-leaf parsley, and basil 3 peaches, pitted and chopped 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 1/4 cup honey 1 tablespoon water Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup cream cheese Instructions: In a large sauce pan, combine the peaches, red pepper flakes, honey, water, and salt, and pepper, to taste and place the pan over medium heat.

The mixture will look dry at this point. Switch to your hands and knead and pinch the dough until it comes together into a ball, 5 to 6 minutes. Try tearing a 1 tablespoon piece of dough off and roll it into a ball between your palms; if it breaks apart as you roll, add 1 teaspoon more boiling water at a time to the dough, but no more than 4 tablespoons; the dough should be slightly dry and chalky, not completely smooth. (Be careful not to add too much water as the dough will lose its chewiness when cooked. It should be slightly wet to the touch, but crackly and dried in some areas.) Keep testing until the right consistency is achieved. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.<br> For the yellow dough: Place the fruit tea in a medium bowl and pour in the boiling water. Let steep until the yellow color intensifies, about 5 minutes. (If you want the songpyeon to look more intensely yellow, increase the amount of tea and steep longer.)<br> Combine the flour, 4 tablespoons of strained brewed tea and salt in a large bowl and quickly stir with a wooden spoon until mixed. The mixture will look dry at this point. Switch to your hands and knead and pinch the dough until it comes together in a ball, 5 to 6 minutes.<br> Try tearing a 1 tablespoon piece of dough off and roll it into a ball between your palms; if it breaks apart as you roll, add 1 teaspoon more strained tea at a time to the dough, but no more than 4 tablespoons; the dough should be slightly dry and chalky, not completely smooth.

Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.<br> For the green dough: Combine the flour, boiling water, mugwort powder and salt in a large bowl and quickly stir with a wooden spoon until mixed. The mixture will look dry at this point. Switch to your hands and knead and pinch the dough until it comes together into a ball, 5 to 6 minutes.<br> Try tearing a 1 tablespoon piece of dough off and roll it into a ball between your palms; if it breaks apart as you roll, add 1 teaspoon more boiling water at a time to the dough, but no more than 4 tablespoons; the dough should be slightly dry and chalky, not completely smooth.

Keep testing until the right consistency is achieved. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.<br> For the filling: Combine 1/4 cup of the sesame seeds, the sugar, honey and salt in a medium bowl. Roughly grind the remaining 1/4 cup sesame seeds in a spice grinder. Add the ground seeds to the mixture in the bowl and mix to combine. The filling should be slightly crumbly but stick together when pressed. Set aside.<br> For assembly: Dust a sheet pan lightly with mepssalgaru. Whisk 2 cups water and the sesame oil together in a large bowl to make the coating water for the songpyeon. Set aside.<br> Fill a large pot that will fit an 8- to 10-inch steamer basket with a few inches of water (the water shouldn\\u2019t touch the bottom of the basket) and bring to a boil over high heat. Place the steamer basket inside and line the basket with damp cheesecloth.<br> Meanwhile, working with one color dough at a time and keeping the rest wrapped, tear off about 1 tablespoon of dough (about 0.8 ounces) and roll it into a ball (it\\u2019s okay if you see small cracks). Press down gently on top of the ball with a thumb, creating a \\u201cwell\\u201d or round dent. Rotate the dented ball as you press with your thumb to create a thimble-like shape, thinning the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Fill the dough with 1/2 teaspoon to 3/4 teaspoon sesame filling and gently press down on the filling. Pinch the dough together to seal in the filling. Roll the sealed dough into a smooth ball, being careful not to tear the dough. Lay the ball on a flat surface and pinch the opposite ends of the ball, pinching to create a thin fin on top. Lay each songpyeon on the prepared sheet pan, fin-side up, and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.<br> The songpyeon may flatten as they sit on the sheet pan, so just before steaming you may want to round them out again. Place as many songpyeon as will fit into the steamer basket fin-side up or fin at a slight slant without touching. Cover and steam until the rice cakes are slightly translucent, about 20 minutes. Uncover the basket and gently pick up the hot songpyeon with chopsticks or tongs and drop into the coating water for a quick rinse before placing on a plate. Repeat until all the songpyeon are steamed and coated.

Add the onions, and saute until they become soft and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan, and set aside.<br> To the same pan, add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the red bell pepper and mushrooms. Season with a pinch of salt, and saute until the peppers are tender and the mushrooms have darkened a little, about 6 minutes.<br> For the kid version, cut 2 of the dough balls in half. You can either freeze the dough now, or make 4 small kid calzones and freeze two then. Up to you!<br> Once the dough is halved, roll out each ball into a 6-inch circle. Lightly spoon about 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce over each dough circle, and sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of mozzarella on top. Sprinkle 1/4 cup pepperoni over the cheese, and top with another tablespoon of mozzarella. Fold one end over the other, and crimp at the seams to close. Continue with the remaining three circles of dough. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with foil.<br> Now for the adult versions: Roll out the 2 remaining 8-ounce balls of dough into 8-inch circles, and spoon 2 tablespoons of sauce over the dough. Top with a tablespoon of mozzarella, followed by a small mound of caramelized onions and sauteed bell pepper and mushrooms. Finish with another tablespoon or so of mozzarella. Fold and crimp at the seams, as you did with the kid calzones. Transfer the two adult calzones to the baking sheet.<br> Brush the calzones with the beaten egg. Lightly sprinkle each calzone with a pinch of Parmesan. Add an additional sprinkling of Italian seasoning to the adult calzones.

Generously grease two 9-inch round cake pans with solid vegetable shortening, then dust with flour. Shake out the excess flour. Set the pans aside. Place the cake mix, milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. Blend with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minutes. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat 2 minutes more, scraping the sides down again if needed. The batter should look well blended. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, smoothing it out with the rubber spatula. Place the pans in the oven side by side. Bake the cakes until they are golden brown and spring back when lightly pressed with your finger, 27 to 29 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and place them on wire racks to cool for 10 minutes. Run a dinner knife around the edge of each layer and invert each onto a rack, then invert them again onto another rack to that the cakes are right side up. Allow them to cool completely, 30 minutes more. Meanwhile, prepare the Quick Caramel Frosting. Place one cake layer, right side up, on a serving platter. Spread the top with the warm frosting. Place the second layer, right side up, on top of the first layer and frost the top and sides of the cake with clean, smooth strokes. Work quickly, as the frosting will set. (If the frosting gets too hard to work with, place the pan back over low heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly, to soften it up.) Once the frosting has set, slice and serve. Store this cake, covered in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, at room temperature for up to 1 week or freeze, wrapped in foil, for up to 6 months. Thaw the cake overnight on the counter before serving. Place the butter and brown sugars in a medium-size heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir and cook until the mixture comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Add the milk, stir, and bring the mixture back to a boil, then remove the pan from the heat. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla. Beat with a wooden spoon until the frosting is smooth. Use immediately (while still warm) to frost the cake of your choice or the frosting will harden. If it does harden while you are frosting the cake, simply place the pan back over low heat and stir until the frosting softens up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37681,&quot;Hot Sausage Burgers with Broccoli Rabe and Provolone 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds coarsely ground pork (ask butcher to do this) 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 1/3 palmful 2 teaspoons smoked sweet paprika, 2/3 palmful 1 1/2 teaspoons ground fennel, fennel pollen or 1 teaspoon fennel seed 1 teaspoon ground sage, 1/3 palmful 1 teaspoon granulated onion, 1/3 palmful 1 teaspoon granulated garlic, 1/3 palmful Salt Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling, plus 1 tablespoon 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 cup tomato sauce Freshly ground black pepper 1 small bundle broccoli rabe, tough ends discarded 1 large or 2 small cloves garlic, finely chopped A few grates nutmeg 4 thick deli slices sharp provolone cheese 4 ciabatta rolls or other crusty rolls, split Store-bought olive oil-rosemary or herb flavored fancy potato chips Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the pork, red pepper flakes, paprika, fennel, sage, onion, garlic and salt, to taste. Form the meat into 4 patties, put on a plate and coat with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Heat a small pot over medium-low heat and add the brown sugar, Worcestershire, vinegar, tomato sauce and black pepper, to taste. Simmer until the mixture becomes a thick steak sauce consistency, about 15 minutes. Add a couple inches of water to a medium skillet over medium-high heat.

Put the whole water chestnuts in a plastic bowl or container of some type and cover with the soy sauce. Pour enough brown sugar into the bowl to cover the chestnuts. It will dissolve as you add it so it may take a fair amount of brown sugar. Let them marinate overnight in the refrigerator. In the morning, stir the mixture and let sit until you need them.<br> Cut the stems off the peppers. The larger the jalapeno the better. Core the jalapenos. You can find a tool called a chili twister at most BBQ/fireplace stores. Warm the package of cream cheese in the microwave and squeeze it into a quart freezer bag. Cut a little bit of the corner off the bag and use it as a pastry bag. Fill the bottom part of the pepper only. Now stuff 1 or 2 chestnuts into the pepper. You may need to cut the chestnuts in half. Leave a little space at the top of the pepper. Take the bacon (thin sliced works best) and cut the strips in half. Wrap each pepper with the half slices of bacon. Use toothpicks to keep bacon in place. Using the rest of the cream cheese, fill the remaining space at the top of the peppers. Sprinkle a little bit of all-purpose bbq rub on the top for some color.

Heat a large Dutch oven (preferably oval) or soup pot with a lid, over high heat. Add half the olive oil and heat. Pat the lamb shanks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper. Add 2 of the lamb shanks to the hot oil and brown on all sides, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer shanks to a plate. Repeat with the remaining olive oil and shanks. Add the garlic, celery, carrots and onions and to the pot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, use a vegetable peeler to strip the zest (just the orange skin, not the white pith underneath) from the orange in large pieces. Halve and juice the orange and set aside. Add the red wine to the vegetables and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any browned bits that cling to the pot. Stir in the orange zest, currants, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook until the wine is syrupy, about 5 minutes. Cut a square of cheesecloth and place the parsley stems, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, juniper berries, peppercorns and star anise in the center. Tie into a bundle with kitchen twine. Add the spice bundle, chicken broth, orange juice and the shanks, along with any collected juices, to the pot, bring the mixture to a boil, cover, and transfer to the oven. Cook about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, turning the shanks occasionally, until the meat is just falling off the bone. Transfer the shanks to a plate. Scoop the vegetables from the liquid using a slotted spoon and set aside. Boil the cooking liquid over high heat until thickened, about 15 minutes. Add the lemon juice, and season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste. Return the shanks to the sauce and warm over medium heat, turning to coat evenly. To serve, mound some of the polenta in the centers of 4 heated dinner plates. Top with a shank, and spoon some sauce and vegetables over and around the meat.

Reserve the remaining chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37705,&quot;Roasted Bone Marrow with Parsley Topping 6 to 12 cups cold water 2 to 4 tablespoons kosher salt, plus 1 pinch for the topping<br> 4 (6- to 7-inch) canoe-cut marrow bones, cleaned of any meat or fat on the exterior of the bones (See Cook\\u2019s Note) 540 grams (about 4 cups) ice cubes<br> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice<br> 1/2 cup (25 grams) packed chopped fresh parsley<br> 1/4 cup (15 grams) packed chopped celery leaves (or additional parsley leaves)<br> 1 tablespoon (10 grams) finely chopped inner celery stalk<br> 2 teaspoons (5 grams) finely chopped lemon peel<br> 1 teaspoon (6 grams) minced shallot<br> 1 teaspoon (4 grams) minced garlic<br> 1 teaspoon (5 grams) capers, drained and chopped<br> 2 to 4 slices toasted bread Flaky sea salt (or additional kosher salt), for serving<br> Instructions: Fill a large 4- to 6-quart container with 6 cups cold water and whisk in 2 tablespoons of the kosher salt to dissolve. Add the marrow bones, cut-side down, and top with the ice. Refrigerate for 24 hours. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and place a rack in the center position. Drain the bones and pat dry with paper towels. You want the bones to cook as level as possible to minimize the loss of fat as it renders out, so place them cut-side down on a small sheet pan. Cover with a generous layer of aluminum foil, then use your hands to mold the foil around the bones and sides of the pans. Place a second pan on top of the foil, then flip the whole apparatus over. Remove the sheet pan that is now on top to reveal the bones, cut-side up, and nestled in foil. They should be pretty close to dead level. Roast the bones for 8 minutes, then rotate the pan and continue roasting until the bones have browned and the marrow is spreadable and soft, but not melted, 15 to 18 minutes total. While the bones roast, make the parsley topping. Whisk the oil, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt together in a medium bowl. Add the parsley leaves, celery leaves, celery stalk, lemon peel, shallot, garlic, and capers and toss to combine. When the bones are finished, immediately dose about a third of the parsley mixture over the marrow and wait 5 minutes. Then, carefully transfer to a platter and serve with the toast, flaky salt, and remaining parsley mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37706,&quot;Miss Brown&#39;s Praline Cookies\\u202f 1 3/4 cups chopped pecans plus 24 pecan halves, for topping 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup whole milk Instructions: For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Arrange the chopped pecans on half of the prepared baking sheet and place the pecan halves on the other half. Bake the pecans until toasted, about 10 minutes. When done, set aside to cool, keeping the chopped pecans and pecan halves separate.\\u202f In a large bowl, cream the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer. Add 1 egg at a time, beating to combine, then add the vanilla and mix well. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture in 2 batches, beating well to combine. Fold in the toasted chopped pecans.<br> Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. With an ice-cream scoop, scoop 1 1/2-tablespoon rounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheets (making sure you leave at least 1 inch of space between each). Cover and chill the dough for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Chilling the dough helps prevent it from spreading during baking.\\u202f<br> After your dough chills for at least an hour, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes, then bake the cookies until slightly golden brown around the edges, 11 to 12 minutes (12 to 13 minutes for crispier cookies). Add a pecan half to the middle of each cookie and cool to room temperature.\\u202f For the praline sauce: While the cookies are cooling, add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter and milk to a medium saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil, whisking continuously. Boil and whisk for 3 minutes more, or until the sauce is thickened slightly and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat. Let cool for 4 to 5 minutes.<br> Drizzle the sauce over the cookies before serving. The cookies and any leftover praline sauce will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days stored separately.

Put the onions and cabbage in a large heatproof bowl or container and pour the boiling liquid over them. Toss to coat. Let the mixture sit for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator and up to overnight. Right before serving, add the parsley. For the pork chops: In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, hot sauce, granulated garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add the brine and pork chops to a large ziptop bag, making sure the pork chops are evenly coated. Close tightly. Allow the chops to sit for 2 hours on the counter and up to 4 hours in the refrigerator. Set up a breading station with one plate of the flour, one bowl of the eggs and one plate of the breadcrumbs. Remove the pork chops from the brine and allow any excess to drip off. Bread the pork chops by evenly coating them in the flour, followed by the egg and finishing with the breadcrumbs. Fit a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack. Pour enough oil into a 12-inch cast-iron skillet to come halfway up the sides of the pork chops and heat over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the pork chops to the skillet in batches and shallow-fry until golden brown or a thermometer reads 135 degrees F, 3 to 5 minutes per side. (If the pork chop breading is getting too dark while cooking in the oil, finish the pork chops in the oven at 350 degrees F until an internal temperature of 135 to 140 degrees F is reached.) Remove the chops to the baking sheet and season with salt.

Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. On a lightly floured work surface, lay out the puff pastry. Cut the puff pastry sheets in half, making 4 rectangles. Place 2 puff pastry rectangles on each sheet pan. Set aside. Add the blueberries and strawberries to separate bowls. Divide the granulated sugar, cornstarch and lemon juice between the bowls. Season each with a pinch of salt and stir until well combined. Divide the blueberries between 2 of the puff pastry rectangles, leaving a 1/4-inch border on all sides. Do the same with the strawberries and the remaining puff pastry rectangles. Pinch the corners of each rectangle, creating a slight lip. Brush the edges with the cream. Bake in the lower half of the oven until golden and crisp, about 20 minutes. For the whipped cream: While the tarts bake, add the cream, powdered sugar and vanilla to a large bowl. Using a hand mixer or whisk, whip until soft and billowy. Transfer to a serving bowl and chill until ready to serve. Transfer the tarts to a cutting board. Let the tarts cool slightly before slicing approximately 6 times across each tart to create thin slices. Transfer to a serving platter. Scatter the mint leaves over the tart pieces and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Unlike other tarts, the tarte tatin is made upside down in a skillet. You start by cooking the fruit, then top it with the dough, carefully tuck in the edges and let it cook. When it&#39;s ready you invert the whole tart onto a plate. It comes out looking beautiful and is actually much easier than you might imagine. To prepare crust: Place flour, oats, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor; process until the oats are finely ground. Add butter one piece at a time, pulsing once or twice after each addition, until incorporated. Add oil and water and pulse just until the dough starts to come together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it a few times until it holds together. Form the dough into a 5-inch disk, wrap in plastic or wax paper and refrigerate while you prepare the filling. Preheat oven to 375degreesF. To prepare filling: Toss pears and apple with lemon juice in a large bowl. Place brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and ginger in a 10-inch ovenproof skillet; cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until the butter and sugar are melted and the mixture starts to bubble. Remove from the heat. Starting at the center of the pan, arrange the pear and apple slices in concentric circles, overlapping the slices and adding another layer until all the slices are in the pan. Scatter cranberries on top. Return the pan to medium-low heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. (It might be hard to see the simmering-take a peek under the fruit or listen for the bubbling.) Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Uncover and cook, gently swirling the pan occasionally, until the sauce becomes a thick, caramel-like glaze, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Roll the dough out between sheets of parchment or wax paper into a 12-inch circle. Peel off the top sheet and invert the dough over the fruit. Peel off the remaining paper. Quickly tuck the edges of the crust down into the sides of the pan. Prick the top with a fork. Transfer the pan to the oven. Bake until the crust is just beginning to brown around the edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan to release the crust. Place a serving plate larger than the pan on top of it and invert the tart onto the plate (it may take a light shaking to release the tart from the pan). Serve warm.

Heat skillet and saute mushrooms in olive oil for 5 minutes or until tender and golden. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve 1/3 of mushrooms for the sauce. Heat stock in a pan and gently simmer. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a heavy saucepan on medium heat. Add the onion and saute until soft and translucent, approximately 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook an additional minute longer. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until rice becomes translucent. Add a ladle of mushroom stock and cook on medium heat until stock is absorbed. Adjust seasoning as needed. Continue to add ladles of stock, repeating the process until rice is tender but still firm. For making the risotto cakes the consistency should be less creamy than a traditional risotto. Spread the risotto onto a baking sheet to cool. Season slices of duck liver with salt and pepper. Sear quickly in a heavy saute pan on high heat on both sides until golden brown. Remove and place on towels to absorb fat. To assemble cakes, place eight 3- by 1 1/2-inch high ring molds on a buttered baking sheet. Fill molds with risotto evenly, slightly less than 1/2 full. Place duck liver in center and top off the molds with remaining risotto. Sprinkle a generous amount of Parmesan on top, refrigerate until ready to bake. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove molds gently and bake in oven for 12 minutes. For the sauce, melt 1/2 ounce of butter in a saucepan. Saute shallots until slightly browned then add remaining mushrooms and saute for a minute longer. Turn to high heat and add the remaining mushroom stock and reduce by half. Adjust seasoning and finish with remaining butter. To assemble, toss greens in salt, pepper, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. Place risotto cakes on plates, spoon sauce around and garnish with tossed green salad.

Preheat the grill to high heat. Sprinkle the steak generously with salt and pepper on both sides and grill over high heat, about 6 minutes per side. You&#39;re looking for a nice crust on each side, but to be true to the Fiorentina method, it should be rare on the inside. If you prefer not to eat your meat rare, cook it a little longer on each side, about 8 minutes per side for medium and longer for well done. Then let it rest for about 10 minutes before you carve into it. Cut the steak off of the bone, carving the strip off on one side and the filet off on the other. Then slice the meat against the grain and serve it on a cutting board or platter with the bone (true Fiorentina style). &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec]&quot; 37729,&quot;Jelly-Filled Cupcakes With Peanut Butter Frosting Baking spray with flour 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup milk 1 cup grape jelly Peanut Butter Frosting, recipe follows Candy bars, crushed with a rolling pin, such as Reese&#39;s Pieces, Butterfinger, Nutter Butter, Heath Bar, or small sandwich cookies, for decorating 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 F.

With the mixer fitted with a dough hook, on low, beat the mixture for about 4 minutes to dissolve the yeast. Sift the sugar, salt, flour and cardamom together. Add this mixture and the egg yolk to the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed until it lightly comes together, then increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl, forms a ball, and climbs slightly up the dough hook. Remove the dough from the bowl and let rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. On a floured surface, place the butter. Lightly dust the top of the butter with flour. Using a rolling pin, lightly pound the butter until flat. Fold the butter in half and continue to pound the butter until the butter is workable. Using your hands, shape the butter into a 8-inch square. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a second floured surface. Roll the dough into a 16 inch square. Place the butter in the center of the dough. Fold the ends of the dough in towards the center, forming a package. Lightly press the ends into the dough, sealing the package completely. Carefully lift the package off of the surface and redust the surface with flour. Lay the package back down on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about a 24-inch rectangle. Fold one end of the dough into the center, then the other end, so that it resembles a letter, and forms a square. (You should have three layers of dough) Place the dough in the refrigerator and allow the dough to rest for 25 minutes. Roll out the dough a second time, forming a rectangle. Repeat the folding process from above two more times, making sure the dough rests between turns. The following directions are for two types of Danish pastries: For Cinnamon Rolls: Roll the dough out 1/4 inch thick. Egg wash the dough. Sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon over the egg wash. Starting at the bottom, roll the dough up lengthwise, forming a jelly-roll. Cut the pastry into 1-inch slices. Place the slices, cinnamon and sugar side on a parchment lined baking sheet and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of each pastry with the egg wash and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for 10 minutes or until browned and crisp. Brush the pastries with the glaze and serve warm. For Pinwheel: On a floured surface, roll the dough out 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into 12 (4-inch) squares. Brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash. Add a spoonful of the cream cheese filling to the center of the square. Place a teaspoon of the jam in the center of the cream cheese. Cut diagonally from each corner to within 3/4 inch of the center. Fold the four alternate points to the center, pressing them down lightly to hold them in place. Place the pastries on a parchment lined baking sheet and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of each pastry with the egg wash and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for 10 minutes or until browned and crisp. Brush the pastries with the glaze and serve warm. For Bear Claws: Roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thick. The longer the dough the more claws yielded. Egg wash the entire piece of dough. Spread a thin layer of almond filling horizontally down the center third of the dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough up to cover the filling. Fold the top third of the dough down, like your folding a business letter. Egg wash the dough. Sprinkle with crushed almonds. Cut the dough into 1-inch pieces, crosswise (the shorter end). Make three slashes into the sides of each piece and spread gently into a horse-shoe shape to separate the toes. Proof until dough in size about 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Spread the remaining 1/4 cup chili sauce over the top of the loaf and bake until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the loaf registers 165 degrees F. About 15-20 minutes longer. Allow the loaf to stand for 5-10 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 37745,&quot;White Sauce 3 tablespoons butter 4 cups milk 1/4 cup flour Salt and pepper Instructions: Melt butter. Whisk in flour and cook a minute. Slowly add milk, whisking vigorously. Simmer for 5 minutes or until thick and smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature, with buttered paper over top to prevent a skin from forming. Transfer to containers and freeze until needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 37746,&quot;Blueberry Cream Tart 1 1/2 cups flour 1/4 cup sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces and slightly softened 1 egg yolk Blueberry Bavarian cream, recipe follows 4 cups blueberries 2 cups milk (not skim) 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 2 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin 2 tablespoons cold water 6 egg yolks 2/3 cup sugar Instructions: Put the flour in a large bowl. Add the sugar and mix. Make a well in the center and place the butter and egg yolk in the well. Using your fingers, work the butter and egg yolk together until well combined, then work the butter-egg mixture into the flour-sugar mixture until combined but still loose. The dough will be crumbly, but when you squeeze a handful, it should hold together. Sprinkle the dough into a 10-inch pie or tart pan. Press the dough firmly and evenly onto the bottom and sides of the pan, making sure not to let the crust thicken at the corners. It should make a clean right angle where the sides meet the bottom. Chill the crust at least 30 minutes, or covered, up to 3 days. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Bake until light golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool before filling. Blueberry Bavarian Cream: Pick over the blueberries, setting aside the best ones to make a circle around the edge of the finished tart. (You&#39;ll need about 1 cup.) Heat the milk and vanilla bean in a saucepan over medium heat just until it boils. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. Combine the gelatin and water in a small bowl, and let dissolve, stirring occasionally, until no dry spots remain. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the still-hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water half way. Strain the mixture into a medium bowl to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Pour off 1 cup of this mixture (Anglaise) into a large bowl and set aside. Place the medium bowl containing the remainder of the mixture in the ice water and let cool, stirring often. Add the gelatin to the cup of hot Anglaise in the large bowl and mix until completely dissolved, creating a Bavarian cream. Working quickly, fold the larger amount of berries into the Bavarian cream and spoon the mixture into the center of the tart shell. Spread until smooth and even. Before the filling cools completely, arrange the reserved berries around the edge of the tart to form a rim. Chill at least 2 hours and serve in slices, pouring a bit of the Anglaise next to each side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 37747,&quot;Chestnut Bisque with Chanterelles and Fresh Chestnuts 1/2 pound bacon, sliced or cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 onion 1 stalk celery, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 small carrot, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 medium parsnip, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 medium Idaho potato, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 pounds fresh chestnuts, boiled and peeled (storebought okay) 12 sprigs thyme, tied together 1 cup Ruby Port wine 1 cup red wine 4 cups chicken stock 1 cup heavy cream Salt and pepper, to taste 2 ounces butter 1/2 cup chanterelles or hedgehog mushrooms, thinly sliced 1/4 cup chestnuts, sliced 1 cup dry white wine 1 carrot, peeled, diced fine 1/2 ounce chives, chopped fine 6 large celery leaves, thinly sliced Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: SOUP: Over medium-low heat in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until the bacon has slightly browned and has started to render its fat. Add the onion, celery and carrot and cook slowly, until soft and translucent. Add the parsnip, potato, chestnuts, thyme, port and red wine and simmer on low heat until it is almost reduced completely. Add the chicken stock and continue to cook until the chestnuts have completely softened, about 30 minutes. Finish with heavy cream, remove the thyme springs and puree in the blender. Strain the soup through a fine sieve and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper. GARNISH: In a large saute pan or nonstick skillet, heat the butter on low. Add the chanterelles, chestnuts, white wine and carrots and cook on low heat until soft, about 7 minutes. Add the chives. To serve, place the warm garnish mixture in the center of a warm soup bowl. Sprinkle with celery leaves, and carefully pour the soup around the garnish mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37748,&quot;Ginger Cookie 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 5 cracks freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup sugar, plus more for rolling the cookies 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1 large egg yolk 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup unsulphured molasses 2 tablespoons ginger preserves (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Whisk the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, mustard, salt and black pepper together in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and the sugars with a hand mixer electric mixer on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and beat on medium speed until just incorporated, about 20 seconds. Add the molasses and ginger preserves and continue beating until the batter is an even light brown color, 30 seconds more. Add the dry ingredients all at once, beating slowly to make a soft, smooth dough. Use a rubber spatula to make sure all ingredients are combined. Then beat again for 20 seconds. Cover the bowl with plastic and refrigerate the dough until firm, about 25 minutes. Put about 1/2 cup sugar in a small bowl. With a cookie scoop or a small ice cream scoop, portion the dough into a slightly heaping tablespoon for each cookie. Roll the dough, by hand, into balls. Roll the tops of the balls in the sugar, and space them 2 inches apart on a nonstick or lightly oiled cookie sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 25 minutes. (The chilling is what gives this cookie a beautiful, crackly crunch on top, and a soft, chewy center.) Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake until the top is crackly, and the insides peeking out through are dark and moist but not raw, about 15 to 20 minutes. Briefly cool the cookies on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Serve or store in a tightly sealed container for up to 3 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 37749,&quot;Sweet-Hot Cabbage Relish 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 1 large clove garlic, smashed Kosher salt 1/4 head red cabbage, thinly sliced 1/2 cup apple cider 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar Freshly ground pepper 1/4 small jicama, peeled and grated 2 tablespoons beet horseradish, drained 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Whisk the eggs, sugar and melted butter together in a medium bowl until well combined and smooth. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the egg mixture. Gradually whisk to make a thick batter, switching to a rubber spatula when the batter is too thick to whisk. Preheat a pizzelle iron until a drop of water sizzles on the hot surface, about 10 minutes. Lightly spray the hot surface with cooking spray. Pipe or spoon about a tablespoon of the batter into the center of each cookie imprint. Close the iron and cook until whiffs of steam come from the iron, 30 to 45 seconds. Open the iron and remove the cookies. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and repeat with remaining batter. Put both chocolates and the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave in 45 second increments, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Spoon a tablespoon of the filling into the center of half the cookies.

Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil. Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper.

Break up the levain well with a wooden spoon or squeeze through your fingers until it is broken up. Stir until the levain is partly dissolved and the mixture is slightly frothy. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until very thick and sticky. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) place for 24 hours.<br> Final dough: 2 cups (16 fluid ounces) spring water 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 cups (27 to 32 ounces) organic white flour with germ 1 tablespoon (3/4 ounce) fine sea salt.<br> Combine the poolish and water in a 6-quart bowl. Break up the poolish well with a wooden spoon and stir until the poolish becomes loose and the mixture slightly frothy. Add 2 cups (10 ounces) of the flour and the salt; stir until well combined. Add just enough of the remaining flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding remaining flour when needed, until dough is firm and smooth, 15 to 17 minutes total. The dough is ready when a little dough pulled from the mass springs back quickly.<br> Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly floured surface while you scrape, clean, and lightly oil the largest bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn once to coat with oil. Take the dough&#39;s temperature: the ideal is 78 degrees. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) draft-free place until doubled in volume.<br> Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling up the sides. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) draft-free place for 30 minutes.<br> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured board and knead briefly. Shape into a tight ball. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap, and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) draft-free place for 30 minutes.<br> Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Flatten each with the heel of your hand on a lightly floured board. The dough may be very soft and loose at this point. Shape into 12-inch-long torpedoes. You may also choose to shape the dough into rounds.<br> Place the torpedoes, seam side up in a well-floured couche*. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap. Put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees) draft-free place until increased in volume about 1 1/2 times, or until a slight indentation remains when the dough is pressed with a fingertip. Place rounds on a cornmeal-dusted surface to rise.<br> Preheat the oven and baking stone to 450 degrees, 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking. The oven rack must be in the center of the oven. If it is in the lower 1/3 of the oven the bottom of the breads may burn, and if it is in the upper 1/3, the top crusts may burn.<br> Gently roll one loaf from the couche onto a lightly floured peel so that it sits seam side down. Using a very sharp, serrated knife or a single-edged razor blade, score the loaf by making quick shallow cuts 1/4 to 1/2-inch deep along the surface. Using the peel, slide the loaf onto the hearth. Quickly repeat the process with the second loaf. Quickly spray the inner walls and floor of the oven with cold water form a spritzer bottle. If there&#39;s an electric light bulb in the oven, avoid spraying it directly; it may burst. Spray for several seconds until steam has filled the oven. Quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3 minutes. Spray again in the same way, closing the door immediately so that steam doesn&#39;t escape. Bake until loaves begin to color, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees and bake until loaves are a rich caramel color and the crust is firm, 15 to 20 minutes. To test for doneness, remove and hold the loaves upside down. Strike the bottoms firmly with your finger. If the sound is hollow, the breads are done. If it doesn&#39;t sound hollow, bake 5 minutes longer. Cool completely on a wire rack.<br> Add the flour directly into the container with the full batch of room-temperature, batterlike ripe chef. Stir vigorously to add fresh oxygen to the mixture. This will form a stiff consistency more like a stiff dough than a batter. This firm texture is important for ripening levain, because a dense rather than loose levain creates delicious sour bread without an overpowering tangy bite. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand in a cool to moderate (about 70 degrees) draft-free place for 8 to 10 hours.<br> The levain should have doubled in volume. The texture will be somewhat light, with many tiny bubbles throughout. Do not let the levain stand for longer than 10 hours, or the yeast will become exhausted and not raise the final dough. This recipe yields 18 ounces of levain. Day 1: Combine the flour and water in a tall 2 to 3-quart clear plastic container with a lid. Stir well to make a thick, soft dough. The exact consistency of the dough will vary with the brand of flour or water at this point to adjust the texture. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, cover tightly with lid and let stand in a moderate (about 70 degree) place for 24 hours.<br> Day 2: 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water.<br> The chef should have almost doubled in volume. You will see tiny bubbles on the surface, and you might notice a slight musty smell. Add the flour and water to the mixture and stir vigorously to distribute the fresh ingredients and add fresh oxygen to the chef. The texture will still be like a soft dough. You may add a little more flour or water to make this texture, if necessary. Scrape down the sides, cover and place in a moderate (70 degree) draft-free place for 24 hours.<br> Day 3: 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water.<br> It will have almost doubled in volume and be quite bubbly. Add the flour and water, and stir well to make a thick batter. (You may have to add a little more water if your flour&#39;s absorption level is high). With a marker pen, mark the level of the chef on the side of the container. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand in a moderate (70 degree) draft-free place for 24 hours.<br> It should now be loose in texture, like a pancake batter. It will have doubled in volume from the last addition of flour and water. The chef may rise and fall, but as long as it doubles at some point during this last period, it&#39;s fine. You now have a fully ripe chef ready to transform into a levain. If you don&#39;t want to make the levain immediately, the chef can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 37758,&quot;Cassoulet 1 whole goose leg (leg and thigh) Mixed herbs Coarse salt Goose fat 6 ounces pork rind 1/2 pound pancetta 1 pig&#39;s foot 1/2 pound garlic sausage 2 pounds dried white beans, such as Great Northern, soaked overnight or blanched &amp; soaked 2 carrots 1 onion 2 garlic cloves Bouquet garni Salt 2 onions, chopped 2 carrots, chopped 1 lamb shoulder, cut into large pieces, but not boned Salt 2 tablespoons flour 1 cup dry white wine 3 garlic cloves Mixed herbs 16 ounces canned tomatoes 2 garlic cloves Bread crumbs Instructions: Sprinkle goose leg with herbs and salt. Let marinate, refrigerated, overnight. Next day, pat dry and combine with melted rendered goose fat. Simmer until tender. Reserve goose and fat. In a large pan cover pork rind, pancetta and pig&#39;s foot with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer 3 minutes. Drain and rinse meats. Combine blanched meats in a large earthenware casserole with beans, carrots, onion, garlic, bouquet garni and garlic sausage, pricked several times. Add enough water to cover by 2 inches and slowly bring to a boil. Cook, covered, at a bare simmer over very low heat. After 30 minutes, remove sausage and pancetta; when cool enough to handle, slice sausage and dice pancetta. Continue to cook beans for 2 hours or until very tender. Add salt in last 10 minutes of cooking time. Discard carrots, onion and bouquet garni. Drain beans, reserving liquid. Remove large bones from pig&#39;s foot and cut into 4 pieces. Cut pork rind into 1-inch squares. Make lamb stew: In a deep saute pan cook onions and carrots in reserved goose fat for 15 minutes or until golden and transfer to a plate. Add lamb and brown on all sides. Return vegetables to pan, season with salt and sprinkle with flour. Cook, turning lamb, until flour is cooked. Add wine, garlic and herbs. Adds tomatoes and enough of the reserved bean cooking liquid to cover. Cook over very low heat for 11/2 hours, skimming occasionally. Remove meat and carrots to a plate and strain sauce into a saucepan. Simmer sauce for 15 minutes until concentrated and flavorful. To assemble: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub bottom and sides of a medium-deep earthenware oven dish with garlic cloves. Layer pork rind and goose, cut into two pieces, and top with 1/3 of beans. Layer pig&#39;s foot, lamb and carrots and top with 1/3 of beans. Layer sausage and pancetta and top with remaining beans. Sprinkle with some bread crumbs and ladle enough lamb sauce over top of mixture for liquid to rise to surface of beans. Dust with more bread crumbs and sprinkle with several tablespoons melted goose fat. Bake until heated through and surface begins to bubble. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F or lower, so casserole bubbles gently and bake about 2 hours. After first 20 minutes, baste surface first with lamb sauce, then with bean liquid. Continue basting every 20 minutes, until top forms a golden-crisp gratin crust. Break surface all over with a spoon so that part becomes submerged and rest is moistened by sauce. Break crust at least 3 times. However, if you run out of basting liquids, it is better to stop baking than to risk dish becoming too dry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 37759,&quot;Roasted Salmon Nicoise Platter 4 lemons, zested and juiced 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 4 garlic cloves, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 pounds skin-on fresh salmon fillets 3 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes 1 1/2 pounds haricots verts, stems removed 3 pounds ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges (6 small tomatoes) 12 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and cut in 1/2 1 bunch watercress or arugula 1/2 pound large green olives, pitted 1 can anchovies, optional 1/4 cup champagne vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup good olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. For the marinade, whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, mustard, garlic, 1 1/2 tablespoons salt and 1/2 tablespoon pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Place the salmon on a sheet pan that has been covered in aluminum foil, and drizzle the marinade over the salmon. Allow the salmon to sit for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the potatoes and 2 tablespoons salt in a large pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with a knife. Drain the potatoes in a colander, then place the colander with the potatoes over the empty pot off the heat and cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Leave the potatoes to steam for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender but firm. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice them in thick slices and set aside. Place the salmon in the oven and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until it is almost cooked through. Remove to a plate and allow it to rest for 15 minutes. Remove the skin and break into large pieces. Blanch the haricots verts in a large pot of boiling salted water for 1 1/2 minutes only. Drain immediately and immerse in a bowl of ice water. Drain again and set aside. For the vinaigrette, combine the vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil to make an emulsion. Set aside.

Bring a pot of water to a boil. Prepare an ice water bath. In batches by type, blanch the radishes, English peas and snow peas in the boiling water for 1 minute per batch. Transfer each batch to the ice water to stop the cooking process, then transfer to a colander to drain. Cut the snow peas into julienne strips. Transfer the blanched vegetables to a bowl and set aside. Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Season the pork chops with the coriander, cumin and some salt and pepper. Add the oil to the pan and heat until smoking. Add the pork chops, reduce the heat to medium and cook until caramelized on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip the chops and cook until caramelized on the other side, another 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add the garlic, tarragon and 3 tablespoons of the butter. Cook, basting the pork with the butter (be careful not to burn the butter, though it will brown lightly), until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees F for medium, about 4 minutes. Transfer the chops to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you make the sauce and finish the vegetables. Drain off half of the butter, add the leeks and saute until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the white wine and cook, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the chicken stock and mustard and cook for a few minutes until slightly reduced. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to form a pan sauce and season with the champagne vinegar. Add the reserved vegetables to warm in the sauce while it simmers to reduce, about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper as necessary. Serve the vegetables and sauce with the pork and garnish with dill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 37761,&quot;Chorizo and Polenta Lasagna 1 quart low-sodium chicken stock 1 1/4 cups quick-cooking polenta Kosher salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, diced 1 pound ground pork 2 tablespoons paprika 1 tablespoon granulated garlic 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 14-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes 1 bunch Swiss chard 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan 1 clove garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper 1/2 cup grated fontina cheese 1/2 cup grated mozzarella cheese Instructions: Make the polenta: Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large pot. Add the polenta and whisk until fully incorporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt; cover and cook over medium heat, 5 to 6 minutes. Finish by folding in the melted butter. Keep warm. Make the chorizo sauce: Coat a large saute pan with the olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until almost translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the ground pork and brown 4 to 5 minutes, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Add the paprika, granulated garlic, onion powder, chili powder and cumin and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook 1 more minute to toast the spices, then add the vinegar, minced garlic and tomatoes. Simmer until the sauce is thickened and reduced, about 15 minutes. Taste and season once more with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Make the lasagna: Wash, drain and finely slice the chard. Heat the olive oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add the chard and saute 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Drain in a colander and squeeze out any excess moisture. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9-inch-oval or 8-inch-square flameproof baking dish. Pour half of the polenta in the dish and spread out evenly. Top with half of the chorizo sauce and all of the chard. Sprinkle with half of each cheese. Top evenly with the remaining polenta, then the remaining chorizo sauce and finally the remaining cheese. Cover with aluminum foil, place the dish on a sheet tray and bake 30 minutes. Turn on the broiler. Remove the foil and broil until the cheese is golden and bubbly, about 3 more minutes. Let sit for 25 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 37762,&quot;Chicken Soup Knishes with Creamy Gravy 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons schmaltz, melted and cooled, or neutral oil, such as vegetable oil (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar 2 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth 4 garlic cloves 2 large carrots, cut into large chunks 1 large onion, chopped 1 parsnip, cut into large chunks 1 bay leaf 1/3 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves (from about 24 sprigs) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs Nonstick cooking spray, optional 1 large egg 6 tablespoons schmaltz, melted and cooled, or neutral oil, such as vegetable oil (see Cook&#39;s Note) 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour Instructions: For the pastry: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the schmaltz, vinegar and 1/2 cup water and stir into a shaggy ball with a spoon or large rubber spatula. (It&#39;s OK if some of the flour remains dry at the bottom of the bowl; the dough will come together during kneading.) Attach the dough hook to the mixer and knead on medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Dump out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it into a uniform ball, about 30 seconds. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes while making the filling. (The dough can be made and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead.) For the filling: Combine the chicken thighs, chicken broth, garlic, carrots, onion, parsnip, bay leaf, half the parsley, half the thyme and 2 teaspoons salt in a wide shallow pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover the pot, and simmer gently over low heat until the chicken is very soft and tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the vegetables to a second large plate. Place a strainer over a large bowl and strain the broth; reserve for the gravy. Transfer the strainer over a plate to catch any drips and set the vegetables and the broth aside. Wipe out the pot and set it back on the stove off the heat. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl and discard the bay leaf. Mash the vegetables with the back of a fork. Pick the chicken meat, discarding the skin and bones. Chop the chicken meat finely and add to the vegetable mixture. Stir in the breadcrumbs and the remaining parsley and thyme. Season generously with salt and pepper. (The filling can be made up to 1 day ahead, but the knishes need to be formed and baked on the same day.) To form the knishes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray and set the pans aside. Beat the egg with one tablespoon water in a small bowl and set aside. Divide the dough in half: Use your hands to roll 1 of the dough halves into a 6-inch-long log on a lightly floured surface, then use a rolling pin to roll the log out into a 16-by-12-inch rectangle. The dough will be very thin. Square off the sides, if necessary, to prevent the end pieces from being too thick and uneven. Position the dough so that the long edges are parallel with the edge of the counter. Shape half of the filling into a 2-by-16-inch log. Transfer the filling on top of the dough, 1 inch in from the bottom edge. Gently stretch the dough up and around the filling. (It&#39;s ok if the dough tears a little as at this stage as it will be hidden as the dough is rolled up.) Then continue rolling up the filling in the dough into a long log. Score the log in 2-inch intervals and then cut the log into 8 segments. Working with one segment at a time, turn the piece so one of the cut sides is up and pinch and smooth the top until sealed. Turn over so the other cut side is facing up, and pinch and smooth that side until sealed as well. Place the formed knish with a sealed side down on one of the prepared baking sheets and then gently press down to flatten it slightly. Repeat the process with the remaining segments, pastry and filling until all the knishes have been formed. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Arrange the knishes about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Lightly brush the tops and sides with the reserved egg wash. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the knishes are golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool at least 10 minutes before serving. The knishes can be served hot, warm or at room temperature. For the gravy: While the knishes are baking, melt the schmaltz in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking, until the flour smells toasty but has no color, about 1 minute. Whisk in the reserved chicken broth and cook, whisking constantly and being sure to get the flour in the corners and sides of the pan, until the mixture begins to thicken, about 1 minute. Simmer the sauce over medium heat, whisking occasionally and running the whisk around the sides and into the corners of the pan to prevent clumping, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Season lightly with salt, if needed. Serve the warm gravy with the knishes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 37763,&quot;Orange Flower Cupcakes 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 vanilla bean, split and scraped 2 large eggs<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons milk<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 6 small mandarins, peeled and segments separated 12 raspberries 1/4 cup apricot jelly Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and vanilla bean seeds together with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time until blended, then beat in the vanilla extract. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in half the flour mixture, followed by the milk and then the remaining flour mixture until smooth. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups and bake until the tops are lightly browned and spring back when pressed, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the frosting: Beat the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Beat in the milk and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Transfer to a piping bag with a plain round tip (about 3/8-inch). Frost each cupcake evenly and top with a circle of overlapping mandarin segments that touch in the middle and curve in the same direction. Place a raspberry in each center. Combine the jelly with 1 tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in the microwave until warm but not hot, about 30 seconds. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the mandarin and raspberries with the jelly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37764,&quot;Pumpkin Pecan Muffins 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tsp. baking soda 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice 1/4 tsp. salt 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed 1 cup canned pumpkin puree 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup STAR Extra Light Olive Oil plus more for oiling muffin pan 1 egg 3/4 cup chopped pecans Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

If using your hands, rub the butter and flour together until the mixture resembles wet sand. Add the sugar, salt and egg yolks, and stir together with a knife. Press the mixture together into a ball. If the pastry feels very dry, add the cream, bit by bit, until it comes together. Press the dough into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator to rest for 30 minutes. For the lemon curd: Meanwhile, in a large, heat-proof bowl, whisk the eggs with the yolks and sugar until the mixture is light and yellow. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk in the lemon juice. Cook, stirring constantly, until very thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon zest and butter until melted and mixed in. Transfer to a bowl, let cool completely, and then refrigerate with a piece of plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface. Blind bake the crust: Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface to about 1/4-inch thick; fit into a 9-inch pie dish and crimp the edges. Place a piece of parchment paper into the pie crust and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until the crust is starting to set and the edges are browning, 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and beans and continue baking until completely golden and crisp looking, another 10 minutes. If the edges brown before the center cooks, cover them with some foil. Let cool completely. At least 3 hours before you are ready to serve, add the lemon curd to the pie shell and refrigerate. When you are ready to serve, make the meringue. For the meringue: Put the egg whites and sugar into a large bowl set over a double boiler. Whisk constantly until the sugar melts and the mixture is very thin and warm. Pour the egg white mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and add the vanilla. Beat on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Turn the speed to low and continue to beat until cool, about 10 minutes. Top the pie with the meringue by either piping with a pastry bag or spreading with an offset spatula to form peaks. Use a pastry torch to brown the meringue and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37770,&quot;Countdown #3 Scallion Pancakes with Crispy Turkey and Cranberry Hoisin Sauce 1 (8-count) package refrigerator biscuits (recommended: Pillsbury Grands) 8 scallions, sliced, some reserved for garnish 3 teaspoons sesame oil, divided Flour, for dusting 1 cup canola oil plus 2 tablespoons 4 cups leftover cooked turkey, shredded 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1/2 cup cranberry sauce 1 cup hoisin sauce, divided 1 cup julienned cucumber Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.<br> Remove the biscuits from the tube.

Remove from the heat and pour in the milk and water. The mixture should be just warm to the touch, about 110 degrees F; let cool or heat over low heat as needed. Stir in the yeast and let stand for 5 minutes, until bubbles come to the surface. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, orange zest and egg yolks. Whisk in the yeast mixture. Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients; fold with a rubber spatula until all the flour is incorporated and a slightly sticky dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and sprinkle the top with flour. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and no longer sticks to the work surface. Lightly grease a medium bowl with the canola oil and add the dough, turning to coat. Cover the bowl and let proof in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the filling: Add the cream cheese, confectioners&#39; sugar, orange juice, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg to a medium bowl. Mix with a hand-held mixer or rubber spatula until completely combined and smooth. Set aside. Bake the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Remove the proofed dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll into an 8-by-28-inch rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick. Spread evenly with the cream cheese filling, leaving a 2-inch border. Add the plastic baby to the filling, and then roll the dough into a 28-inch log. With the log seam-side down, bring both ends together to form a circle. Lightly brush the inside of one end with water and insert the other end inside to close the circle. Brush the seam lightly with water and pinch to seal. Place the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, making sure to form it back into a circle--it should be approximately 10-inches in diameter. Using a paring knife, make six 2- to 3-inch diagonal slits in the top of the dough (to act as vents during baking). Let the dough rise an additional 30 minutes, until puffed up and the vents have opened slightly. Bake the cake for 40 minutes, until the top and bottom have a deep golden-brown crust. The slits may also widen as during baking; that is normal. Remove the cake from oven and let cool for 30 minutes on the baking sheet. For the icing: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and orange juice until smooth. Spoon the icing over the top of the cooled cake, pushing it to either side. If some icing pools in the center or on the sides, just scoop it up and drizzle it over the cake again; you want to make sure the entire cake is covered in icing. Working quickly, so the icing doesn&#39;t set, sprinkle the yellow sanding sugar over a 2-inch section of the cake. Next to that, sprinkle the green sanding sugar, followed by the purple. Continue in this pattern until the entire cake is covered in sanding sugar. Transfer the cake to a cake stand and serve immediately, or hold at room temperature until ready to serve. This cake is best served the same day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37780,&quot;Chicken with Tomato and Apple Balsamic Vinegar 4 chicken halves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons chopped onion 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1/4 cup white wine 1 cup apple balsamic vinegar or balsamic vinegar 3 cups tomato concasse (skinned, seeded, and diced tomatoes) 3 tablespoons butter 1 bouquet garni (celery, bay leaf, parsley, and leek tied in a bundle) Instructions: Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

Add the flour and using a spatula, combine until uniform. The mixture will be the consistency of pancake batter. Cover with plastic and let it sit at room temperature until bubbly, and the mixture has grown by about half its volume. This will take 20 to 25 minutes. For the dough: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Mix on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl with a spatula. Add the eggs and yolks, and mix again at medium speed for 1 minute. The eggs and yolks will not fully emulsify with the butter mixture, and it will resemble very wet scrambled eggs. This is ok!<br> Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom again with the spatula, then add all of the flour and mix until just combined, about 10 seconds on low speed. Remove the paddle, scraping off any of the butter, egg and flour mixture back into the bowl. Switch to the dough hook and add all of the sponge. Turn the mixer on low speed and mix, kneading the dough into a smooth ball. This will take 20 to 25 minutes. You can stop the mixer halfway through and scrape down the sides with a spatula to make sure everything is fully incorporated.<br> Lightly spray the top of the dough with neutral cooking spray and cover with plastic. Let it proof at room temperature until doubled in size, usually 1 1/2 to 2 hours.<br> Gently punch down the dough, transfer to a large bowl lightly sprayed with neutral cooking spray, cover with plastic and transfer to the fridge for 3 hours or overnight.<br> When you\\u2019re ready to fry, set up 2 sheet trays. Cut 16 to 18 squares of parchment paper, about 3 inches square, and spray each with neutral cooking spray. Line them up on the sheet trays, without overlapping. Remove the dough from the fridge and gently turn it out onto a floured work surface. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour and gently roll it out into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. This dough rolls best cold. Using a 2 1/2-inch round cutter, punch out circles of dough, cutting 16 to 18 rounds.<br> Place the cut rounds on the squares of parchment, giving each its own square. Spray the rounds with a little neutral cooking spray and cover loosely with plastic. Allow them to proof at room temperature until doubled in size and light to the touch, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> When the dough is proofed, heat the oil in a deep pot until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F. While it heats up, set up a sheet tray with a resting rack right by the stove. Keep a slotted spoon handy.<br> When the oil is hot, pick up the rounds of dough on their parchment paper squares and carefully drop about 5 rounds at a time into the hot oil. The parchment will separate itself from the dough as it starts to fry, and you can fish it out and discard as you go. This makes transferring them to the oil very easy. Allow them to fry, flipping them with the slotted spoon, for 3 minutes on each side. They should be deep golden brown. Use the spoon to transfer them to the resting rack when done. Repeat until all the dough is fried.<br> For the fillings and toppings: Place the sugar in a mixing bowl. Once the sufganiyot are cool enough to handle, gently roll each in the sugar, coating well. It\\u2019s fine if they\\u2019re warm when you do this. Transfer to a clean tray to continue cooling.\\u202f<br> Fit a piping bag with a Bismark piping tip. Fill your piping bag with your filling of choice. Once the sufganiyot are cooled to room temperature, use the piping tip to poke a hole into the side or top (a style preference) of each, and squeeze in the filling, being careful to not overfill.

Saute onions in the bacon fat for a few minutes, do not allow the onions to brown. If bacon does not provide enough fat, add a little olive oil to prevent the onions from sticking. When onions become glossy, add the beef, sauteing with the onions for about 10 minutes, covered, until the meat is browned. Meanwhile, chop and crush the garlic with the caraway seeds; add to meat and onions. Remove pot from heat. Stir in paprika rapidly with a wooden spoon. Immediately after paprika is absorbed, add the warm water. The water should just cover the meat, leaving room for potatoes. Add beef bouillon cubes. Cover pot and cook over low heat for about 1 hour. While stew is braising, prepare the tomatoes by cutting into 1-inch pieces. Core green peppers and cut into strips. After 1 hour of braising, add the tomatoes and green pepper. Add a little more water, if necessary and a little more salt if you need it. Simmer slowly for another 30 minutes. Peel potatoes and cut into bite-sized cubes and set aside in a bowl of water. Add potatoes, and cook another 30 minutes until the potatoes are fork tender and the goulash is done. Once goulash is finished, dissolve sour cream and a little of the goulash sauce in a cup. Add to goulash, it should give a creamy consistency. Serve goulash with spaetzle and Cucumber Salad on the side, adding an extra dollop of sour cream to each plate.<br> Peel and slice cucumbers very thinly. The side of a metal grater with the wide slots works best here, or you can use a mandoline. Place cucumbers in a flat dish and sprinkle throughout with salt, making sure that all the slices are salted. Leave to rest for 30 minutes. The salt will draw the moisture out of the cucumbers. Cut the onion into paper-thin slices and place in a container. Once the cucumbers have released water, use your hands to squeeze out the excess water and add to the onions. The cucumbers are supposed to be limp, but still crisp. In a measuring cup mix vinegar, water, sugar and paprika to create a vinaigrette. Pour over the cucumbers and onions and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 1/2 hours.

Add the butter, and work it into the flour mixture with your fingers until the butter is broken down into very small pea-size pieces. Make a well in the center, and pour in the milk. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet with a fork. Once the dough comes together, knead it gently a couple of times on a well-floured work surface. Roll it out to a little thinner than 1/8 inch. Cut it into as many 1 1/2-by-3-inch rectangles as you can; discard any scraps. On each rectangle, lay 4 green bean halves crosswise (the tips should poke out a little) and top with about 1 teaspoon of the cheese; roll the rectangle up, making sure the ends overlap; seal and arrange, seam-side down, 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Brush each with egg, and sprinkle with caraway seeds. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the mustard and sour cream in a small bowl.

Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil and mix with your hands into a smooth dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap; set aside in a warm place until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until slightly elastic, dusting with more flour if the dough is too sticky to handle, about 5 minutes. Return the dough to the bowl, cover and set aside again until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Brush 2 baking sheets with olive oil. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, dusting with more flour if needed. Cut the dough in half and form into 2 balls. Roll out each ball into a 12-by-3-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Transfer each dough rectangle to one of the prepared baking sheets and let rest, uncovered, until a dry crust forms on top, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Meanwhile, position racks in the middle and lower thirds of the oven. Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the bottom rack and preheat to 475 degrees F for at least 40 minutes. Press your fingertips through the dry crust on top of the dough to create a spotted pattern. Gently stretch each piece of dough into a 14-by-4-inch rectangle, then brush the tops with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Put 1 baking sheet of dough on the pizza stone and bake until the bottom of the bread is golden brown, about 7 minutes. Transfer to the middle rack and continue baking until golden all over, about 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately brush the top of the bread with olive oil and sprinkle with salt; let cool on the baking sheet on a rack. Repeat with the remaining dough. Make the dressing: Whisk the vinegar, mustard and dried basil in a bowl. Add the sugar and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Assemble the sandwiches: Slice each flatbread in half horizontally and brush with the dressing. Top the bread bottoms with the tomatoes, mozzarella and basil leaves.

Fry in 1 1/2 inches of oil at 350 degrees. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37833,&quot;Grilled Focaccia with Mozarella Di Bufala, Sweet Italian Sausage, and Fresh Tomatoes 2 packages active dry yeast 2 teaspoon sugar 2 cups warm (100 degrees F to 110 degrees F) water 2 tablespoons kosher salt 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 4 pounds sweet Italian sausage, links 2 pints red cherry tomatoes 2 pints yellow cherry tomatoes 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 bunch fresh basil 4 (8-ounce) balls of fresh mozzarella di bufala, drained Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large bag fresh salad mix 1 chunk Parmigiano-Reggiano, (equal to 1 1/2 cups grated) Instructions: Begin by making the dough so it has time to rest and rise. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, or in a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and warm water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes. If you&#39;re using a mixer, turn the mixer on low, add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and let it go until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 5 minutes. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you&#39;re making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water, if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep the sausages from sticking. Grill the sausages until cooked through, turning with tongs. Set aside. Keep the grill hot to make the pizza. Roll or pat the dough into a rustic, oblong shape, about 1/4-inch thick - do this directly on a lightly floured pizza paddle for ease. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and lay oil side down onto the hot grill. Once the dough looks set, in about 2 minutes, turn the crust over. Now prepare the topping. Cut up the tomatoes and add to a large mixing bowl. Add the garlic and basil. Crumble in the sausage. Rip the mozzarella into pieces with your hands and add that too along with some extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, add the salad mix and toss to combine. Once the crust is set and cooked, transfer it to a platter. Scoop up the salad mix in your hands and spread it evenly over the top. Sprinkle with a good dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 37834,&quot;Green Bean Casserole 3 pounds green beans Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 loaf crusty Italian bread 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 3 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves 4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds mixed mushrooms (such as button, cremini, shiitake), sliced 2 shallots, sliced 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add a big pinch of salt and the green beans. Cook for about 5 minutes, the beans should still be crisp, they will be cooked more in the oven. Drain them and set aside. Butter a baking dish large enough to hold the green beans with 1 tablespoon butter and set aside. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and shallots, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms have released their liquid, about 10 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream, add the remaining thyme and chives, and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the green beans and stir well. Put the green bean mixture into the prepared baking dish, top with the croutons, and sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan.

Pour the hot fruit puree over the chopped milk chocolate. The hot puree will melt the milk chocolate. Use a whisk to mix the chocolate and fruit puree. Add the butter and continue to whisk. Continually whisk while adding the alcohol and the corn syrup. Mix until well combined with no remaining lumps. Let this cool. Must be less than 88 degrees or it will melt the chocolate molded inside each cavity. Paint the molds: Place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and apply color to the empty molds. This is what will give the finished chocolates their color. Repeat to paint as many molds as you have. Mold the chocolates: Use a ladle to fill the mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of each cavity should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean with an offset spatula and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the mold again with an offset spatula. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat to fill as many molds as you have. Place the raspberry ganache in a piping bag and pipe it into the chocolate filled molds. Leave just enough room for the layer of chocolate that closes the mold. Let set in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or overnight. To close the bottoms of each cavity, use tempered white chocolate and apply with an offset spatula. Scrape clean and allow to them to set. You can place them in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. When the chocolate has set, invert the mold over a clean dry surface. It may be necessary to rap the mold against the counter to encourage the chocolates to release from the mold.

Roll out the pie dough on a floured surface. Gently lay it in a deep-dish pie pan and press it into the grooves of the pan. Cut off the excess. Set aside. Chop up the bacon into bite-sized pieces. Fry the onions in the butter in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat until deep golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the eggs, cream and some salt and pepper together in a large bowl. Add the bacon, onions and cheese and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the pie shell. Cover lightly with aluminium foil, place on a sheet pan and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake until the quiche is set and the crust is golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Fit for a king or a cowboy. Lightly mix 2 cups of the flour with the salt and sugar in a mixing bowl or a food processor. Cut the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter or by pulsing the food processor. (The mixture should look like large crumbs and begin to cling together in clumps.) Add the remaining 1/2 cup flour and mix lightly or pulse two or three times so as not to overmix the flour. Tip into a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cold water over the dough and mix with your hands or a wooden spoon until the dough holds together. Shape the dough into two discs. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge until ready to use. It can also be frozen for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 37891,&quot;Cilantro cl Slaw 4 1/2 cups finely shredded green cabbage 2 cups finely shredded red cabbage 1 cup diced roasted, seeded and peeled Anaheim chilies 2 cups diced scallions 2 tomatoes diced 1 1/2 cups cilantro leaves 4 ounces fresh lime juice 3 tablespoons fresh crushed garlic 1/2 cup mayonnaise Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Toss the 2 cabbages, chilies, scallions and tomatoes together.

Wash and place in a small bowl. Cover with 3 ounces bourbon. Allow the leaves to soak for 15 minutes. Then gather the leaves in paper toweling. Thoroughly wring the mint over the bowl of whisky. Dip the bundle again and repeat the process several times. To prepare simple syrup, mix 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 cup of distilled water in a small saucepan. Heat to dissolve sugar. Stir constantly so the sugar does not burn. Set aside to cool. To prepare mint julep mixture, pour 3 1/2 cups of bourbon into a large glass bowl or glass pitcher. Add 1 cup of the simple syrup to the bourbon. Now begin adding the mint extract 1 tablespoon at a time to the julep mixture. Each batch of mint extract is different, so you must taste and smell after each tablespoon is added. You are looking for a soft mint aroma and taste-generally about 3 tablespoons. When you think it&#39;s right, pour the whole mixture back into the empty liter bottle and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours to \\marry\\ the flavors. To serve the julep, fill each glass (preferably a silver mint julep cup) 1/2 full with shaved ice. Insert a spring of mint and then pack in more ice to about 1-inch over the top of the cup. Then, insert a straw that has been cut to 1-inch above the top of the cup so the nose is forced close to the mint when sipping the julep. When frost forms on the cup, pour the refrigerated julep mixture over the ice and add a sprinkle of powdered sugar to the top of the ice. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Bourbon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 37895,&quot;Grilled Clams with Garlic Butter 1 1/2 pounds littleneck clams, well scrubbed (about 24) 8 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, divided 4 large garlic cloves, minced (about 3 tablespoons) 1/4 cup white wine 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons minced chives Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat a grill or Great Grates over medium heat. Scrub and rinse the clams. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a 1-quart saucepan over low heat until it is foamy. Add the garlic and saute, stirring, until it is fragrant but does not color, about 30 seconds. Add the white wine and heavy cream, increase the heat to medium-high and reduce by half, about 8 minutes. Add the remaining butter 1 piece at a time, whisking constantly, until the sauce is shiny, emulsified, and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the chives and season with salt and pepper. Keep the sauce warm until ready to serve. Set up the littleneck clams on the grill or Great Grates or place them directly on the grill. Cook the clams without turning them. As soon as the clams pop open, after 8 to 10 minutes, transfer them carefully with tongs to a platter (or plates) of rock salt. If you are using a Great Grate, this won&#39;t be necessary. Use the tongs to pry off the top shells. Spoon 1 teaspoon sauce over each clam and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 37896,&quot;Mole Amarillo 1 chicken, cut into 8 pieces 1 medium onion, chopped 3 medium garlic cloves, crushed Salt 3 medium chayote 1/2 pound green beans 2 anchos 12 guajillos or 6 chilcostles 10 tomatillos 1 large green roma tomato 1/2 medium onion 4 medium garlic cloves, unpeeled 8 whole black peppercorns 4 whole cloves 1 teaspoon cumin seeds<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 cup masa harina 1 cup water 4 large fresh hoja santa leaves or 6 sprigs cilantro 3 chiles de agua or 1 jalapeno and 2 anaheims 1/2 cup vegetable oil, for frying<br> 10 pearl onions 1/2 cup lime juice 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano, preferably Oaxacan Cooked white rice, as accompaniment Heated tortillas, as accompaniment Instructions: Clean the chicken pieces and place them in a stockpot with boiling water, onion, garlic, and salt, reduce the heat and poach the chicken until tender about 30 minutes.

In a large saucepan, combine ketchup, Worcestershire, horseradish, tomato sauce, tarragon vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, lemon juice, and cayenne. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Season, to taste, with salt. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it generously. Blanch the cauliflower for about 2 minutes; it should still be crisp. With a skimmer, transfer the florets to a tray to cool quickly. Repeat with the carrots and then with the celery, cooking them just long enough to remove their raw taste; they will be cooked more later. Add the white wine vinegar to the water and blanch the mushrooms for 1 minute (the vinegar will keep the mushrooms white). Drain and spread the mushrooms on a tray to cool quickly. Add the cauliflower, carrots, celery, and mushrooms to the sauce. Add the juices from the canned and jarred vegetables. Add the pepperoncini, olives, pickles, onions, and artichoke hearts and toss well. In sterilized canning jars, place 1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar (this will guarantee freshness). Load the sauced vegetables into the jar, using a wide-mouthed funnel to avoid a mess. In one of the large pans that you have used, add olive oil, tuna, and anchovies and mix well. Top each jar with some of the tuna mixture. Cover and refrigerate, or allow to cool on the counter before serving.

Place the almond paste in the bowl of an electric mixer. Gradually add the eggs, 1 a time, incorporating each before you add the next. You may need to stop the mixer and scrape the bowl to incorporate all of the almond paste into the mixture. Slow the mixer to low speed and add all of the hot melted butter. When it is slightly incorporated, increase the speed and mix until well combined. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the almond mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. I used a flexible silicon mold but you could also use a mini-muffin tin. Spray the mold with vegetable cooking spray. Pipe the almond paste mixture into the molds. Place a few raisins on top of the piped mixture. Bake until lightly browned, about 20 minutes, depending on the size of the molds used. Place the rum in a squeeze bottle. When the Raisin Punches have cooked, soak them right away while they are still hot with the rum. If you do not want to use the alcohol, simply skip that step. Serve. Place the sugar, honey and water in a saucepan and bring to a strong boil. Place the almonds in the food processor and grind until coarse. Remove the boiling sugar from the heat and pour over the coarse almonds. Blend until smooth. This may take 10 minutes or more, depending on the strength of the food processor. Remember, food processors are not usually strong enough to yield the same consistency as the almond paste that you can buy. If your mixture is too thick and the food processor is straining, you can add a little Kirsch or simple syrup to the processor. Add the liquid slowly and stop when the processor is moving more freely. The quality of almond paste is determined by how smooth the consistency is. Wrap the almond paste in plastic wrap and allow it to cool. When you are ready to use it, knead in the butter. The butter makes it smooth and not so sticky. Yield: About 2 cups I like to use hydrated raisins in a lot of recipes. I always keep a jar of them in the refrigerator. The proportion I use for adding the liquor is about to 10 to 20 percent of the weight of the water. If you do not dilute the liquor with water, be prepared for a very strong burst of flavor! Place the raisins in a mixing bowl or glass jar and add water so that it covers the raisins by at least 1/2-inch. Stir in the rum or flavored alcohol. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours. It is even better to allow the raisins to hydrate for 2 to 3 days. They will become very plump as they absorb the liquid. You can keep them in the refrigerator for a few weeks. When you are ready to use them, strain the amount that you need through a fine-mesh sieve before adding them to the recipe.

Move one rack to the top of the oven. In a saucepan, simmer the corn with the milk and onion powder, if using, for 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch with about 2 tablespoons water and stir well. Add the cornstarch to the corn mixture and whisk over medium heat for 3 minutes. Season the corn cream with a little nutmeg, salt, pepper and hot sauce if using. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm. Boil the elbow macaroni in full rolling salted water for 4 to 6 minutes. Drain the macaroni well and add to the corn cream. Add the Cheddar, half of the mozzarella and the egg. Stir well. Pour into a 4-cup casserole dish or 12-inch cast-iron skillet and top with the remaining mozzarella. In a zip-top plastic bag, lightly crush the croutons using a small mallet or rolling pin. Stir together the oil and crushed croutons and spread over the top of the macaroni and corn mixture.

Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub with the skin with olive oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones, discard the skin, and shred the chicken in large bite-sized pieces. Blanch the asparagus in a pot of boiling salted water for 3 to 5 minutes until crisp-tender. Plunge into ice water to stop the cooking. Drain. Cut the peppers in strips about the size of the asparagus pieces. Combine the cut chicken, asparagus, and peppers in a large bowl. Whisk together all of the ingredients for the dressing and pour over the chicken and vegetables. Add the scallions and sesame seeds and season to taste. Serve cold or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37914,&quot;Cucumber Kimchi 3 medium Kirby cucumbers, sliced 1/2 inch thick Kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 6 cloves garlic 1 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled 4 teaspoons gochugaru 4 teaspoons fish sauce 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar Instructions: Put the cucumbers in a large heatproof bowl. In a saucepan, whisk together 1 tablespoon salt and 2 cups water; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then pour over the cucumbers and let sit 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water, then return the cucumbers to the bowl. Toss with 1 teaspoon each salt and sugar; let sit 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pulse the garlic, ginger and 2 tablespoons water in a mini food processor until finely chopped, scraping down the sides. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the gochugaru, fish sauce, vinegar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Drain and rinse the cucumbers. Blot dry, then toss with the sauce. Transfer to a medium jar; let sit 4 to 6 hours at room temperature. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 37915,&quot;Falafel Waffle 4 cups dried chickpeas 1 cup split dried fava beans, without skins 4 cups fresh parsley (flat or curly), roughly chopped 1 head garlic, roughly chopped 1 small leek (or 1/2 cup chopped leeks), roughly chopped 1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped 1 green bell pepper, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds 1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds 1 tablespoon whole fennel seeds Salt Oil, for frying, or nonstick cooking spray, for the waffle iron Instructions: Soak the chickpeas and fava beans overnight. Grind the beans, parsley, garlic, leek, onion and bell pepper in a meat grinder, double grinding if desired, to get a smoother texture. (Extra batter can be frozen at this stage for later use.) Mix in the coriander, cumin, fennel and salt right before cooking, or the batter will turn. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F in a deep-fryer or Dutch oven fitted with a deep-fry thermometer or preheat a waffle iron. Use a falafel maker or hand-form the batter into flattened balls (to ensure even cooking). Deep-fry the falafel until they float to the top and the number of bubbles emanating from each falafel decreases significantly. Or, for falafel waffles, spray a waffle iron with nonstick spray, add a lump of batter and cook until brown and crispy on the outside but still green and soft inside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 37916,&quot;Salted Preserved Lemons Fennel seeds Cinnamon stick Coriander seeds Peppercorns Bay Leaf Sea salt Large fat Lemons (preferably Sicilian ones with the leaves still attached) Instructions: In a bowl mix the spices into the sea salt. Cut a cross into the lemons -- almost to the base, but so that the quarters stay together. Push the seasoned salt into the lemon segments and pack the lemons as tightly as possible into an airtight jar. The less space there is between the lemons the more attractive it will look and you won&#39;t need to use so much salt. The lemons will be ready after one month of preserving, and will last for about 2 years. Tips:The peel is edible This also works very well with limes You could preserve oranges like this too -- but there are not so many recipes which use them You must use sea salt not table salt -- table salt is too chemical and harsh Uses:For seasoning rice and couscous -- it works like salt and makes the rice and couscous lemon scented Put chicken/fish into a foil bag and bake with the lemon salt Use to season stews and soups ; &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 37917,&quot;Shrimp with Vinegar Cream 1/3 cup kosher salt 1/3 cup brown sugar 1 quart cold water 1 pound large (16/20 size) white shrimp 3 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup minced shallots or green onion 1/2 cup fruit vinegar, such as pear 1 cup rich chicken stock 1/3 cup heavy cream or creme fraiche 1/4 cup diced fresh fruit such as pears (or whatever the vinegar is made of), optional 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh herbs, of your choice Salt and freshly ground pepper Garnish: Fresh chervil or tarragon sprigs Instructions: Stir the brine ingredients together until salt and sugar are dissolved.

Add the steak and turn to make sure it is completely covered by the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 12, turning the bag occasionally. Melt the butter in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Once melted add the flour and stir until it becomes a light blonde color. Slowly whisk in milk. Bring the milk up to a simmer while stirring. Once at a simmer, stir in the cheese, a handful at a time. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Keep warm until ready to use. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Toss green onions in a bowl with olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Remove the steak from the marinade and let the excess drain off. Grill the steak for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare and about 8 to 10 minutes for medium. Remove the steak from the grill to a cutting board and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. While the steak rests, put the green onions and baguettes on the grill. Cook the green onions until charred and soft, about 4 minutes, and toast the bread until golden. To assemble, slice the steak, at a 45 degree angle, into very thin slices across the grain. Put some of the steak on the bottom of each roll, top with some grilled green onions, and smother with provolone cheese sauce. Cover with the top of the roll and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 37921,&quot;Gooey Blondies 3 cups, plus 3 tablespoons flour, sifted after measuring 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 8 ounces unsalted butter 2 cups, plus 10 tablespoons, packed, dark brown sugar 3 eggs, lightly beaten 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 cups peanut butter chips 1 cup toasted pecans Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease and flour a 9 by 13-inch baking pan and set aside. Sift flour with salt, baking soda, baking powder and set aside. Melt butter in a large sauce pan over low heat. Add the brown sugar, remove it from the heat and stir until completely blended; let cool to room temperature. Add eggs one at a time stirring well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. With a rubber spatula, fold the sifted flour into the batter with a few smooth swift strokes and stir just until batter is blended and smooth. Do not over mix or the blondies will be heavy. Stir in the chips and nuts and pour into a prepared pan. With a spatula, spread the batter to make sure it is even in thickness. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the top springs back when you press it lightly with your fingertips or when a toothpick, when inserted in the center of the dough comes out clean. Remove the blondies from the oven and let them set until completely cool.

Make a well in the middle. Build the well as high as possible to avoid water running out. Add some of the water to the well and use a dinner fork or your fingers to gently mix the flour into the water without collapsing the walls of the mound. Using your other hand to support the wall of flour helps keep the water from leaking. As you mix, slowly add more water to form a soft and sticky dough. It should not be either too dry or too wet. When you touch it, it should stick to your finger only slightly. Keep in mind that as you knead, the dough gets softer. If the dough is too wet, add a little flour. Knead the dough with a periodic dust of flour for 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest about 1 hour. If you don&#39;t have time, 20 minutes would do. This is only 1 of many ways to shape the cavatelli: Cut off a small piece of dough and roll it into a long rope about 1 centimeter (.4 inch) in diameter. Cut the dough into 1-centimeter-long (.4-inch-long) pieces. Place a piece in front of you horizontally and rest your index and middle fingers on it. Press the dough as you pull your fingers towards you. As you pull, the dough rolls to form the cavatelli shape. Place the pasta pieces on a lightly-floured baking sheet or plate. For the lobster cheese sauce: Heat a stockpot with the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the lobster shell-side down and saute for 6 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic and peppercorns and sweat the vegetables, then add the brandy and cook for about 4 minutes. Remove the lobster and set aside. Add 4 cups water to the pot, bring to a boil and simmer until reduced by at least 25 percent. Meanwhile, make the roux. Add the clarified butter to a pan over low heat and gradually whisk in the flour until it gets very thick. Strain the stock and place it back in the same pot. Bring to a boil, whisk in the heavy cream and roux and simmer to the desired consistency. Stir in the provolone, asiago, fontina and Parmesan until melted. Stir in the truffle oil. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt generously. Cook about 6 ounces of the cavatelli until they float to the top and are al dente, about 4 minutes. For the crumb topping: Mix together the breadcrumbs, parsley, butter, truffle oil and a pinch salt and pepper in a small bowl. Remove the lobster meat from the shell and cut it into pieces. Fold it into the cheese sauce, then fold in the pasta. Pour the mixture into an oven-safe dish and top with the crumb topping. Bake for about 6 minutes.

Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of flavor and color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center, using a folding motion. When it has just cooled enough to handle, pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of a sugar lamp.<br> Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them.

For the mustard hollandaise: Put the egg yolks in a medium, stainless-steel bowl set over (not in!) a pot of simmering water. Whisk the yolks until pale yellow and fluffy. Slowly add the melted butter, a few tablespoons at a time, and whisk until thickened. Remove from the heat, whisk in the lemon juice, the stone-ground and Dijon mustards and the hot sauce, and season with salt to taste. Turn off the heat under the water and set the hollandaise back on the pot to keep warm while you poach the eggs. For the poached eggs: Combine the vinegar and 3 cups water in a large, high-sided skillet, and heat to a gentle simmer. Break each egg into a cup, and gently add to the water. Poach until the yolks are nearly set, 4 to 5 minutes. While the eggs cook, toast and butter the English muffins. Put two English muffin halves on each of four plates. Top each half with a sausage patty, a poached egg and a good ladleful of hollandaise.

Pour the melted butter over the mixture and mix well with a spoon until the crumbs are coated in butter. Place 2 ring molds (3 1/2 inches in diameter) on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. With a tablespoon, split the mixture equally between the 2 molds. Press the biscuit mixture down with a flat object so it is compressed. Place the sheet in the fridge for 20 minutes or until the cheesecake batter is ready. These can be left overnight if desired and prepared the next day. For the cheesecake batter: Place the gelatin sheets in a bowl of cold water and allow them to soften for 5 minutes. Next, in a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk until hot but not boiling, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Remove the gelatin from the bowl of cold water and squeeze out any excess water with your hands. Place the gelatin into the pan of milk and whisk to dissolve. Set aside. Add the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla to a medium bowl and whisk to combine until smooth, about 30 seconds. Pour in the milk/gelatin mixture and whisk to combine again. In a separate bowl, whisk the cream to soft peaks. Using a whisk or spatula, fold this into the cream cheese mixture. Add half of the batter to a separate bowl and leave it white. Add two-thirds of the remaining batter to another bowl and color it dark pink. Color the remaining batter a lighter pink. Stir in the colors with a spoon and then allow the batter to sit for 10 minutes to thicken. Pour half of the white batter on top of one of the biscuit bases, then pour half of the dark pink batter into the center of the white batter (swirling it slightly to create a circle) and then finally half of the light pink batter into the center of the dark pink batter. Repeat the process with the remaining batter for the second cheesecake. Take a toothpick and drag the white batter towards the center. Then, just slightly adjacent to the line you just created, drag the light pink batter from the center to the outside. Repeat this all the way around the cheesecake to create a swirled effect. Place the cheesecakes in the fridge to set for 3 hours and up to overnight. To serve, gently heat the sides of the ring molds with a warm cloth or a kitchen blowtorch and slide them off to reveal the cheesecakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 37942,&quot;Spinach Potato Knish 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold seltzer 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds medium russet potatoes (about 3) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 16-ounce bag frozen whole or cut-leaf spinach, thawed 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 2 medium yellow onions, small dice (about 2 1/2 cups) 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup heavy cream, warmed Spicy mustard, for serving Instructions: For the dough: Put the flour in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse as you pour the oil through the feed tube. Scrape down the sides of the processor and pulse again. Combing the seltzer and vinegar in a measuring cup. Add 1 teaspoon salt and stir to dissolve. Pulse as you pour the liquid through the feed tube into the flour mixture, 20 to 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours.<br> For the filling: Put the potatoes in a saucepan, cover with water and season the water liberally with salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until tender and a fork inserted in the center goes in without any resistance, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. (You can put the potatoes in the freezer for a few minutes to hurry along the cooling process.)<br> Meanwhile, place the spinach in a clean dishtowel, wrap tightly and wring out as much liquid as possible. Roughly chop the spinach and reserve.<br> Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the spinach, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine. Turn off the heat and reserve.<br> Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature just until it is pliable, 30 to 45 minutes.<br> When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, use the side of a spoon to peel away the skins. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the cream and remaining tablespoon of oil and coarsely mash. Add the spinach mixture to the mashed potatoes and gently stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br> Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly brush a baking sheet with oil.<br> To make the knishes: Put the dough on a floured sheet of parchment and dust the top with flour. Stretch the dough into a 6-by-8-inch rectangle, then use a rolling pin to roll it into a 12-by-18-inch rectangle. Arrange the dough with one of the long sides of the rectangle facing you. Put the filling along the length of the dough and shape it into a compact 14-by-2-inch log, leaving a 2-inch border of dough on the side closest to you and on each end. Use the parchment paper to help roll the dough around the filling, brushing off the flour as you roll and stretching the dough as needed to make a tight, dough-covered log.<br> Pinch the dough closed along the center seam, then carefully turn the roll seam-side down on the parchment. Pull on the dough at each end of the log to twist and seal it closed; pinch off the excess dough. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, divide the log into 3 even sections, pressing down through the log to seal the segments. (The log will resemble three links of sausage.) With a sharp knife, cut through the connections and separate the links. Pinch the ends to ensure that each seal is secure. Cut each of the links in half crosswise to make 6 knishes total. Arrange the knishes cut-side up, pressing to flatten each into a disk about 1 1/2-inches thick.<br> Arrange the knishes on the prepared baking sheet 2 inches apart. Bake 30 minutes; liberally brush the knishes all over with oil and continue baking until golden, 25 to 35 minutes more.

Add the barley and stir together so the barley gets coated with oil and begins to toast. Reduce the heat and slowly add the vegetable stock a little at a time to the toasted barley. Stir constantly until all the liquid you&#39;ve added has evaporated, then add more. Continue to do this until all the stock has been used. Reduce the heat to low and add the asparagus. Simmer until the asparagus is cooked, normally around 8 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Alternatively, you could blanch the asparagus first in boiling water, prior to adding it to the cooked barley. This will save you time if you&#39;re in a hurry. Stir in the cream, cheese and butter and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with the chopped basil before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37951,&quot;Hoisin Noodle Bowls, Roasted Mushroom Yakitori and Cucumber-Sesame Salad Salt 1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti 4 limes, juiced, divided 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 3 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 seedless cucumber, thinly sliced 1 red onion, thinly sliced, divided 3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 2 pounds mixed fresh mushrooms - shiitake, oyster, crimini 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce 1 bunch scallions, chopped into 2-inch lengths 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided 1 tablespoon grill seasoning 1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced 1 cup pea pods, thinly sliced 3 to 4 cloves garlic, grated 1 (2-inch) piece ginger root, grated 1 (10-ounce) package frozen shelled edamame 1/4 cup hoisin sauce, available on Asian foods aisle of market 1 to 2 tablespoons Asian chili sauce or hot sauce, to taste 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves Handful mint leaves, finely chopped Instructions: Heat a large pot of water for pasta and salt it.

Wrap the larger piece in plastic wrap and reserve. On a lightly floured surface, roll the smaller piece into a round, 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick, large enough to overlap a 10 by 2-inch pie plate. Arrange in the pie plate and even with a sharp knife, leaving about a 1/2-inch overhang. (Add the trimmings to the reserved dough). Tuck the overhang back under, making a slightly thicker edging. Chill for 30 minutes. If using a glass pie plate, remove from the refrigerator 15 minutes before filling. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the reserved piece of dough into a 12-inch square, about 1/4-inch thick. Cut out a piece of cardboard, 1/2-inch wide and 10 or 12 inches long. Wrap the strip in plastic wrap and use as a guide. With a sharp knife or a pastry cutter, cut the dough into 20 (1/2-inch) strips. Lay 10 strips vertically on the back of a large baking pan, leaving a very small space between strips. Weave a lattice pattern by placing each of the remaining strips over and under horizontally. (It&#39;s easier to weave if the dough is not too firm, but it can&#39;t be too soft, either. If it&#39;s too soft, refrigerate for a little while and then continue). To weave, turn back every other strip of dough (1, 3, 5, etc.), lay a horizontal strip across, as close to the top as possible, and return the turned-back strips to the original length. For the next row, alternate the strips that you turn back (2, 4, 6, etc.) and again place a horizontal strip across, close to the first strip. Repeat this procedure until all the strips are used. Refrigerate just until firm. Using a 9-inch cardboard round, a plate, or a pot cover as a guide, cut out a 9-inch circle of latticework and refrigerate on the baking pan until needed. (Excess dough can be wrapped and refrigerated or frozen for future use). Peel, core and quarter the apples. Cut into 1/4-inch slices. In 2 or 3 large skillets, melt the butter (2 or 3 tablespoons in each skillet, depending upon how many you use) and brown. The butter will have a slightly nutty aroma. Divide the apples, arrange in the pans, and coat with the butter. Sprinkle in the sugar and over medium-high heat, saute the apples until lightly caramelized and tender, 15 to 20 minutes, turning often so that the apples cook evenly. Pour in 1 tablespoon of Calvados and the brandy and cook until the alcohol burns off. Pour in the cream and stir through. Transfer and spread over a large baking tray to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Warm the remaining 1/4 cup Calvados. Combine the chopped prunes, apricots, and figs in a small bowl. Pour the Calvados over and let plump. In a large bowl, combine the cooled apples and the plumped dried fruit. Stir in the lemon juice, cinnamon, lemon and orange zests, and nutmeg, and mix well. Spoon the filling into the prepared pie plate. Using a wide spatula, carefully transfer the 9-inch latticework circle and arrange on top of the filling. Brush the latticework with egg white and sprinkle with the crystallized sugar. Bake 30 minutes, turn the oven down to 350 degrees F and bake 35 to 40 minutes longer, until the crust is golden brown. Cool on a rack. Serve warm. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour and sugar. Add the butter and process until the texture resembles fine meal. In a small bowl, whisk together the yolks and 1 tablespoon of the cream. Scrape into the machine and process until a ball begins to form, using the additional tablespoon of cream, if necessary. Remove the dough from the machine, and on a lightly floured surface, press down into a circle. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 37953,&quot;Couscous 6 cups hydrated instant couscous 1 red onion, small dice 1 red pepper, medium dice 1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted 1 cup golden raisins 1/2 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped 1/2 orange, zested 1 orange, juiced 1/2 lime, zested and juiced 1/2 lemon, zested and juiced 1 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons sugar Instructions: Mix hydrated couscous, diced onion, diced pepper, sliced almonds, golden raisins, and parsley.

In a medium saucepan, combine the chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, butter and salt. Bring to just short of boiling over medium heat, until the mixture is loose and the chocolate chips are melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the walnuts and vanilla using a wooden spoon. Pour the hot mixture into the prepared baking dish and refrigerate until cool and set, about 2 hours. Then, using a 1-inch square cookie cutter, cut the fudge into cubes. For the cookies: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the cookie dough from its packaging and transfer to a lightly floured surface; roll to 1/4 inch thick. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and parbake for 10 to 11 minutes. Using the 1-inch square cookie cutter, cut the parbaked cookies and return to the prepared baking sheet. Bake the cookies until they are lightly golden around the edges, 5 to 6 minutes. If they have puffed up and lost their shape, use the same cookie cutter to punch out the cookies again while they are still warm, for cleaner edges. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. For the assembly and decorations: In a medium bowl, combine the royal icing with gel food color and mix until completely incorporated. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round number 2 tip. Pipe a dab of the royal icing onto the center of each cookie and adhere a cube of fudge on top. Decorate each fudge bite with more royal icing then top with a candied violet.

Heat the oil over medium heat until the thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and top with a wire cooling rack. Separate the biscuits, then cut each biscuit in half, creating 16 half-moons. Use your fingers to separate the dough of one half-moon into 3 layers. With the rounded edge up, gently wrap one layer around a fingertip to create the center of the rose. Slide it off and then wrap a second layer around the center, trying to match the shape of a flower. Wrap the third layer around the blossom, using a fingertip to lightly press the rounded edges outward like petals. Give the base of the flower a light pinch to secure the layers together. If the dough has dried out slightly, dampen it lightly with water and then pinch it. Repeat this process with the remaining biscuit halves. Carefully lower the roses a few at a time into the hot oil. Be sure not to crowd the oil or the temperature will drop. Control the heat to maintain 325 degrees F. Fry until golden brown all over, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on the prepared cooling rack. Continue with the remaining roses.<br> Let the doughnuts cool completely and then drizzle with Floral Doughnut Glaze. Immediately sprinkle with dried rose petals or lavender, as desired. Allow the glaze to set for 1 hour. For the rose glaze: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, rose jelly and pomegranate juice in a small bowl until incorporated. For the lavender glaze: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and lavender honey in a small bowl until incorporated. Add 1 to 2 drops of lavender oil, depending on the desired vor intensity. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 38030,&quot;Honey Mustard-Glazed Ham 1 18- to 20-pound water-added smoked ham, hock removed 2 cups light brown sugar 1 cup clover honey 1 cup country dijon mustard (or 1/2 cup each regular dijon mustard and mayonnaise) Instructions: Adjust the oven racks to accommodate a large roasting pan and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fit the pan with a shallow rack. Unwrap the ham and rinse it in cold water. Place it on the rack in the roasting pan. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch opening to allow steam to escape. Bake the ham for half the estimated cooking time, about 3 hours. (Total cooking time is about 20 minutes per pound.) Add the brown sugar and honey to a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the mixture is smooth and the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the mustard. Pour the mixture over the ham. Continue baking the ham, uncovered, basting occasionally with the drippings in the roaster, for the remaining time, about 3 more hours. Check for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into a meaty part of the ham, avoiding any fat or bone. The thermometer should register 160 degrees F. Allow the ham to stand 15 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices inside the ham to set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38031,&quot;Edamame with XO Sauce 1-ounce dry scallops, soaked in water overnight 3/4-ounce dry shrimp, soaked in water overnight 6 ounces canola oil, for frying, see Cook&#39;s Note* 1-ounce shallots, chopped in food processor 3/4 tablespoon garlic, chopped in food processor 3/4 tablespoon finely chopped serrano chiles 3 1/4 ounces prosciutto, finely diced 3/4 tablespoon lemongrass, finely minced 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 cl de arbol, finely minced in food processor 1/2 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon 1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper 2 pounds plus 12 ounces frozen edamame 4 ounces XO sauce 1 tablespoon oyster sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon togarashi Instructions: For the XO Sauce: Drain scallops and shrimp, process both separately in food processor to shred and chop. Or they can be chopped by hand. Beginning with scallops, place in oil and cook until lightly browned, strain. Continue with this procedure with; shrimp, shallots, garlic, serrano chiles. When it comes time to cook the prosciutto, this will take a bit longer as you will want to render this until almost crisp as with bacon. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. This is best if used the following day so all the flavors may come together. This recipe can be made in large quantities and used at later dates. Can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. Can also be frozen. For the Edamame: In a pot of boiling water, blanch the edamame, strain. In a wok/saute pan with a small amount of cooking oil, saute cooked edamame with remaining ingredients and toss vigorously.

Bring to a boil over high heat and boil vigorously until the surface of the water is foamy, about 10 minutes. Drain the bones and meat in a colander (discarding the liquid) and rinse well with cold water. Clean the inside of the pot, put the blanched bones and meat back into it and add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes, skimming and discarding any foam that rises to the surface. Meanwhile char the onion and ginger over an open flame until well blackened on both sides. (Alternatively you may place them on a foil-lined baking sheet and broil on high, turning once, until well charred, about 10 minutes.) Add the onion, ginger, fish sauce, cloves, star anise, cinnamon, black peppercorns and rock sugar to the pot and continue to simmer. Skim the surface of the soup often to remove the fat and foam that rises. If necessary, add water during cooking to keep the bones submerged. Cook until a paring knife pierces the chuck easily and comes out with little resistance and the oxtail meat pulls easily away from the bone, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Remove the meat and bones from the pot with a slotted spoon or spider to a rimmed baking sheet. Discard the larger bones and let the chuck and oxtail cool enough to handle, 10 minutes. Meanwhile pour the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot and keep hot over medium-low heat. (You should have about 12 cups of broth.) Put the rice noodles into a large bowl and cover with hot water. Let the noodles soak until soft, 10 to 15 minutes, then drain and divide between 6 serving bowls.<br> Pick the oxtail meat from the bones and divide it between the bowls. Thinly slice the beef chuck across the grain of the meat and divide it between the bowls. Divide the sliced eye of round between the bowls and then ladle the hot broth over.

Refrigerate the mold to chill, about 15 minutes. Put half the milk chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until melted, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining chocolate and continue to stir until smooth; this will result in a tempered chocolate that will set hard. Transfer 3/4 cup of the chocolate to a small bowl; set aside.<br> Swirl half the remaining chocolate inside the mold to coat completely. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Repeat with the other half of the chocolate, swirling to create a thick layer; refrigerate for 15 minutes. Fill the egg with the candy. Top with the cake cutout and press down firmly so the cake is flush with the mold (trim away any extra cake with a serrated knife).<br> Microwave the reserved chocolate to remelt if needed, then measure out 1/2 cup. Spread the chocolate over the cake with a spatula to cover completely. Refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes. Invert the egg onto a serving platter or cake stand; remove the mold. Microwave the remaining chocolate to remelt if needed, then transfer to a piping bag with a small round tip. Use the chocolate to attach candies to the outside of the egg. Chill until ready to serve.

Combine the apples flour, apple pie spice, lemon zest, 1/2 cup of the sugar and 1 tablespoon of the maple syrup in a large bowl. Mix together to thoroughly coat the apples. Transfer the apple mixture into the pie crust. It will be mounded slightly above the edge. Pack the apples down to create an even layer for the bacon lattice. Place 6 slices of bacon horizontally across the pie. The edges of each slice should touch, but not overlap. Working with the remaining 6 slices, weave the bacon in an over-under pattern to evenly cover the top of the pie. This should be done by lifting alternating slices of the horizontal bacon and vertically placing a slice of bacon over or under as needed to create a woven design. Use kitchen shears to trim the bacon that hangs over the edge of the pie tin, making sure the bacon covers the rim of the pastry because it will pull back as it bakes. Cover the pie with aluminum foil, place it on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 tablespoon maple syrup in a small bowl. Stir in the vinegar and sprinkle with a generous pinch of black pepper. Set aside. After the pie has baked 25 minutes, remove the foil and gently brush the bacon lattice with the maple glaze. Return the pie to the oven and continue baking, uncovered, until the bacon is brown and crispy and the apple mixture is bubbly, about 35 minutes more. Allow the pie to cool completely before slicing. Serve with whipped cream if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 38036,&quot;Grilled Pizza Margherita 11 ounces lukewarm water 1 teaspoons fresh yeast 1 tablespoon molasses 2 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup whole wheat flour Pizza Sauce: 2 cups plum tomatoes in heavy puree, drained, finely chopped 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup basil, chopped 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic, finely minced Grilled Pizza Margherita: Pizza Dough Recipe, above recipe 4 1/2 cups cheese 1 batch pizza sauce, above recipe 3 tablespoons parsley 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Instructions: Mix the water, yeast and molasses in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let this stand for 12 minutes to activate the yeast (the water will foam slightly). Add the salt and oil to the bowl and mix well. With the mixer on low speed add the all-purpose flour and the whole wheat flour to the bowl and mix until all the flour is absorbed and the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Remove the dough from the bowl and cut the dough into 6 (5 1/2-ounce) portions. Roll the portioned dough into balls and place on an oiled baking pan. Brush the ball lightly with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap. If you are going to use the dough right away let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before using. You can store the dough after portioning for 1 day in the refrigerator, but you must let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour before using. Mix the tomatoes, basil, garlic and olive oil and set aside.; Prepare your fire - preferably a charcoal fire but a gas grill does very nicely also. Make sure the grill is set at least four inches from the fire. On an oiled surface, roll the dough out, using the palms of your hands. If the dough is sticking to the surface, lift the dough and drizzle a little more oil on. Make about a 12-inch circle with an even thickness. Carefully lift the dough being careful not to tear it. Drape the dough onto the hot spot of the grill. The dough will start to rise immediately. Carefully lift the edge of the dough and see the color of the bottom - it should be evenly golden brown - this should take about 2 minutes. Flip the dough over and place it on the side of the grill. Brush the cooked side of the dough with olive oil, spread some cheese and a tablespoon dollop of pizza sauce on the pizza, then drizzle the pizza with some extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with parsley. Continue to cook, until the bottom of the pizza is evenly golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 38037,&quot;Panino di Prosciutto e Fontina 2 to 4 slices (3 ounces total) fontina cheese 2 slices (1/2-inch-thick) rustic white bread 2 paper-thin slices red onion (optional) Salt Freshly ground black pepper 6 fresh baby spinach leaves 1 to 2 paper-thin slices (1/2-ounce) prosciutto 2 to 3 teaspoons olive oil Instructions: Place 1 to 2 slices of fontina atop 1 bread slice.

Beat butter and brown sugar together in the bowl of a mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add the eggs, molasses, and water and beat until well combined. Beat half of the flour mixture into the mixer until blended and smooth. Add the remaining flour mixture and then knead the dough until firm and manageable, but not dry. Add more flour if the dough is wet. Place the dough in a sealable container or zip-top bag in a cool place for up to 2 hours. If you make the dough ahead of time and refrigerate it, bring to room temperature before working the dough. When ready to roll out the dough, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray your cookie sheets with nonstick spray. Roll out dough and cut into desired shapes, working in small batches and keeping the remaining dough in an airtight container so that it does not dry out. Bake for 11 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces. The gingerbread will be light brown when it is done. Let cool before icing. Combine egg white and powdered sugar in a microwaveable bowl and microwave until the mixture reaches 160 degrees F. The best way to do this is to microwave the mixture on high power, stopping every 20 seconds to take the temperature; it will take about 2 minutes and 40 seconds, but cook time will vary based on microwaves. Make sure to use clean utensils each time you check the icing. The other option is to microwave the mixture for 45 seconds on high, but the consistency will not be as good. Beat on high speed until the icing cools and holds a stiff peak, about 2 minutes. If the icing needs to be thicker, add up to 2/3 cup more sugar; you will probably need to add about 1/3 cup more sugar. Food coloring can be added, if desired. Work with the icing in small amounts, keeping the remaining icing in an airtight container, as it will dry quickly. Beat all ingredients together in the bowl of a mixer until stiff peaks form. Food coloring can be added, if desired. Work with the icing in small amounts, keeping the remaining icing in an airtight container, as it will dry quickly. The icing can be re-beaten if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38050,&quot;Campfire Baked Beans with Puffed Rice Topping 8 ounces bacon, diced, cooked and drained (3 tablespoons bacon grease reserved) 1/2 medium onion, chopped<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> Three 15-ounce cans pork and beans, 1 can drained of juice 3/4 cup raisins, chopped<br> 1/4 cup maple syrup<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder<br> Salt and pepper 1 cup puffed rice cereal 1 cup diced hamburger buns<br> 1/4 cup cooked, diced bacon<br> 11 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon butter, melted Salt and pepper Instructions: For the baked beans: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium.

Unroll the pie dough onto a floured surface. Press the cinnamon sugar into the dough with your hands (try not to stretch the dough). Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate and crimp the edges. Refrigerate the crust until firm, about 1 hour. Place a baking sheet on the middle oven rack; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line the crust with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake on the hot baking sheet until golden around the edges and set on the bottom, about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake until crisp and golden all over, about 10 more minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool; leave the baking sheet in the oven. Make the filling: Whisk the eggs, corn syrup, brown sugar, vinegar, vanilla and salt in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the melted butter, then stir in the pecans until evenly coated. Scrape the mixture into the cooled crust. Bake the pie on the hot baking sheet until set and bubbling at the edges, 55 to 60 minutes. (Cover the crust with foil if it darkens too quickly.) Transfer to a rack to cool completely.

Wash the chicken in hot water and dry thoroughly. Season the cavity with salt and black pepper and stuff with the onion, lemon, and celery leaves. Rub the chicken lightly with softened butter and season all over with salt and pepper. Tie the drumsticks ends together and set the chicken, breast side up, in an oiled v-shaped rack or on an oiled roasting pan in the oven. Roast for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees, baste the chicken, and roast for 15 minutes. Add the chopped onion and carrot to the pan, basting them and the chicken. Continue roasting the chicken until the juices run clear, for a total of 45 minutes plus an additional 7 minutes for each pound. (In other words, a 3 1/2 pound chicken would take a basic 45 minutes plus an additional 25 minutes, for a total 70 minutes or 1 hour and 10 minutes of cooking time.) Remove the chicken and spoon the fat out of the roasting pan. Into the pan, stir in the herbs and blend in the broth and, stirring constantly, boil for several minutes on the stovetop to concentrate the flavor. Correct the seasoning and strain the sauce into a warm sauceboat.

Pour the hot custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large metal bowl; discard the vanilla pod. Add the gelatin mixture and stir until dissolved. Refrigerate the custard, stirring every 5 minutes, until it is the consistency of soft whipped cream, 10 to 20 minutes. Beat the heavy cream in a medium bowl with a mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Add the whipped cream to the custard and gently whisk until combined. Refrigerate the frosting, gently folding with a rubber spatula every 5 minutes, until thick enough to pipe, 10 to 20 minutes. Working quickly, transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip and pipe onto the cupcakes. Decorate with sugar pearls. Refrigerate immediately to set the frosting, at least 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Bubbly, Brut Ros, Prosecco, Cava]&quot; 38057,&quot;$${jcr:title} 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 1/3 cups packed dark brown sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour, sifted 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets and set aside. Melt chocolate in a double boiler set over barely simmering water or in the microwave at 50 percent power. Allow to cool to room temperature. In a mixer, beat the butter and sugar until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each egg is added. Beat in the vanilla and the espresso. Gradually add the flour, beating well after each addition until just combined and scraping down the sides of the bowl, as necessary. Add baking soda and salt.

Wash and dry the cans, then brush the insides of the cans with 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Dust the insides with cornmeal. Arrange on baking sheets.<br> Spread the 1/2 cup cornmeal on another baking sheet and bake until toasted, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid uneven baking. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.<br> Cut the kernels from the corn cobs. Break the cobs in half. Combine the cobs, kernels, milk, salt and vanilla seeds (save the pod for the glaze) in a saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer; adjust the heat and simmer 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let the mixture steep until cool. Strain the kernels and reserve the flavored milk and the kernels separately. Discard the cobs.<br> Grind the dehydrated corn to a fine powder in a food processor or blender. Put the corn powder, flour, toasted cornmeal, sugar and baking powder in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Put the flavored milk, eggs, the remaining 6 tablespoons melted butter, and the oil in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Add the buttermilk and mix well, then mix in the strained corn kernels.<br> Divide the cornbread batter between the cans, filling each three-quarters full, or pour the batter into a buttered 9x13-inch pan or into buttered Mason jars. Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the baking sheets, and then bake until the tops are golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the cans comes out clean, about another 20 minutes. (A 9x13-inch pan of cornbread will take about 45 to 50 minutes.)<br> While the cornbread is baking, prepare the glaze: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the syrup, soda, salt, vanilla bean paste and the reserved vanilla bean pod. Bring up to a simmer and continue to simmer until the syrup thickens slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla bean. Whisk in the bourbon, and set aside. (The glaze can be made ahead and reheated when needed.)<br> Remove the cornbread from the oven and set the cans on wire racks to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. With a fork or a skewer, poke holes into each cornbread; this will allow the syrup to soak into the bread. With a pasty brush, liberally paint the tops of the breads with syrup (or drizzle the syrup into each can). Let cool completely. If using a 9x13-inch dish, poke holes into the top of the cornbread and glaze as with the cans.<br> Remove the cornbreads from the cans to store as leftovers. They will keep for 2 to 3 days in an airtight container at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Chardonnay]&quot; 38059,&quot;Soy-Marinated Flank Steaks 1 flank steak, about 1 1/2 pounds 1/3 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 cloves garlic, crushed 1 teaspoon sugar Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Poke the steak all over with the tines of a fork; cut in half, against the grain, to make 2 steaks (1steak may be slightly thicker). In a non-reactive bowl or large re-sealable plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, Worcestershire, vinegar, oil, garlic, sugar, and pepper, to taste. Add the steak, and turn to coat. Cover or reseal the bag and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for up to 6 hours. Remove the steak from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels.

Rinse chicken inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels. Rub chicken lightly with oil then rub inside and out with salt, pepper and dry rub. Set aside. Open beer can and take several gulps (make them big gulps so that the can is half full). Place beer can on a solid surface. Grabbing a chicken leg in each hand, plunk the bird cavity over the beer can. Transfer the bird-on-a-can to your grill and place in the center of the grate, balancing the bird on its 2 legs and the can like a tripod. Cook the chicken over medium-high, indirect heat (i.e. no coals or burners on directly under the bird), with the grill cover on, for approximately 1 1/4 hours or until the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F in the breast area and 180 degrees F in the thigh, or until the thigh juice runs clear when stabbed with a sharp knife. Remove from grill and let rest for 10 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Lager, Pilsner, Hefeweizen, Cream Ale]&quot; 38081,&quot;Poulet a la Regina 8 to 12 skinless, boneless chicken tenderloin 1/2 small eggplant 2 large tomatoes 1/2 white onion 1/2 green squash 2 small Italian sweet, green peppers 1 small can of chickpeas 1 stick unsalted butter Salt and pepper 1 cup white wine 2 sprigs of fresh basil Instructions: Remove the tendon from the chicken.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stir and cover. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and fluff the rice with a fork. Replace the lid and let the rice sit for 5 minutes. Once the rice is fully cooked, immediately spread it out on a baking sheet. The goal here is to get the rice to cool as quickly as possible. For the coconut glaze: Combine the coconut milk, sugar and lemon zest in a small saucepot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Let the mixture reduce by two-thirds, until thickened and syrupy, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. This takes 20 to 25 minutes. To assemble nigiri (pressed sushi): Moisten your hands and mold the rice into 2-inch long logs. Drizzle a little coconut glaze over the rice. Cut some fruit leather into 1/2- by 2-inch strips (or use the pre-cut Fruit by the Foot strips), and use to wrap the rice logs cross-wise, mimicking the belt of seaweed wrapped around nigiri. Top with whatever fruit you like-blueberries and sour cherries look like salmon roe. (Alternatively: First top the rice with fruit, then secure the fruit to the rice by wrapping with strips of fruit leather.) Sprinkle with sesame seeds, top with mint leaves and serve. To assemble maki rolls: Lay the fruit leather out flat and cover it with an even layer of rice about 1/2-inch thick. Drizzle with some of the coconut glaze and sprinkle with some sesame seeds. On the side closest to you, lay down a row of julienned fruit-either mangoes, pineapples, strawberries, or cherries, or whatever you like. Top with some torn mint leaves and roll the entire thing into a cylinder, keeping it as tight as possible the whole way around. Slice into rounds with a sharp knife and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 38094,&quot;Grilled Artichokes with Bagna Cauda 1 cup dry white wine 4 sprigs thyme<br> 2 sprigs rosemary<br> 1 bay leaf Kosher salt<br> 1 lemon, halved<br> 2 artichokes, halved, outer leaves removed, tips trimmed, stems and bases peeled<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1/4 cup olive oil 3 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1 teaspoon anchovy paste<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes Kosher salt Instructions:</p>",113)]))}const g=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
