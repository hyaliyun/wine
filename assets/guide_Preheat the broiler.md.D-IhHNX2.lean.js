Add the oats, maple syrup, brown sugar, sage, thyme, salt, rosemary, cayenne, nutmeg, red pepper, eggs and some black pepper and continue to pulse just until the mixture comes together into a thick batter. There should still be some coarse bits of oats and walnuts. Heat a generous layer of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Dollop 2 tablespoons of batter per patty into the skillet, allowing at least 1 inch between patties, flatten them slightly and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, another 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel to soak up excess oil.

Add the flour, salt and 1 tablespoon corn oil and mix on medium-low for 5 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon oil to a 12-inch cast-iron or heavy oven-safe skillet and paint it with a brush all over and up the sides. Place the dough in the center of the skillet and cover in plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in size, for up to 2 hours. For the pizza: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Arrange the bacon slices on the lined sheet tray and bake until slightly crisp but still soft in the middle, 5 to 8 minutes. Let cool, then cut into 1-inch strips. Set aside until ready to use. Turn the oven up to 500 degrees F. Press the dough down lightly in the skillet until it reaches the edge. (If the dough is being temperamental and not stretching, cover with plastic wrap and let it chill out for 10 minutes to let the dough relax, then press it to the edge.) Ladle a layer of sauce on the dough and evenly spread to the edge. Now it&#39;s cheese-shingling time! Start around the edge, letting the cheese go up the inside wall of the skillet and then covering the middle so there is one even layer of cheese on the pizza. Top with an even sprinkling of pineapple and bacon. Bake the pizza until both the cheese crust around the edge is golden brown and the toppings are nicely charred and bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes. I like using a fish spatula to gently and carefully lift a portion of the crust to peek underneath and see if it is getting super golden brown. You may need to move the skillet to the top rack or bottom rack depending on whether the top or bottom crust chars first. Let the pizza cool for 10 minutes. Slice and serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 49382,&quot;Clams Casino Mazemen 4 strips bacon, cut into bite-size pieces 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 medium shallots, minced<br> One 1-inch knob fresh ginger, minced<br> 1/4 cup Italian flavored breadcrumbs<br> 3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan 2 cups chicken stock<br> 1/4 cup dry white wine<br> 1 pound Manila clams, scrubbed<br> Two 4-ounce packages instant ramen noodles<br> Fresh basil and red pepper flakes, for garnish, optional<br> Instructions: In a large saucepan, add the bacon and cook over medium-high heat until the bacon begins to brown, a couple of minutes.

Prepare the rice by combining the 2 teaspoons salt, the drained rice, and 5 cups water in a large heavy pan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer 20 minutes on low heat. Remove from the heat. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fluff the rice and spread one third of it in the bottom of a casserole or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. Sprinkle one third of the fried onions, cashews, and raisins on top of rice, then add half the lamb mixture. Continue to layer with one third of the rice, one third of the garnish, all the remaining lamb, and finally the last third of rice. Reserve the last third of the garnish for later. Seal the top with foil, then place the lid over the foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Spoon onto a large platter and garnish with the remaining fried onions, cashews, and raisins. Place the halved boiled eggs, yolk up, around the edges of the platter. Serve immediately. In a heavy, preferably light-colored skillet melt the butter over medium-low heat. The melted butter will sputter gently as the moisture boils out of it, and the bubbles will change from large to fine and foamy. Once the foam appears, push it aside every few seconds to see if the milk solids have settled to the bottom of the pan. When this sediment appears golden brown, remove it from the heat. Do not let it turn dark brown. Cool the ghee for a minute or two, then pour the liquid into a container with a tight-fitting lid, leaving most of the solids behind. Cool it completely, cover, and store at room temperature for 1 month or in the refrigerator for 3 months. Ghee turns to a solid as it cools, so bring it to room temperature before using, or melt it by placing the jar in which it is stored in hot water. Place the star anise in a coffee grinder and grind to a fine powder. Measure out 2 teaspoonfuls, reserving the rest for another use. Grind the fennel seeds in the coffee grinder to form a fine powder. Combine all the ingredients and store in an airtight jar away from the light. It will keep for 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49391,&quot;Chuck&#39;s Enchiladas 12 ounces ground beef 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 small yellow onion, finely diced<br> 32 ounces low-sodium beef broth<br> Two 14-ounce cans whole tomatoes<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 1 tablespoon chili powder<br> 2 teaspoons paprika<br> 2 teaspoons ground cumin<br> 6 dashes hot sauce, such as Cholula Kosher salt 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> Twelve 6-inch flour tortillas<br> 8 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated<br> 8 ounces jack cheese, grated<br> 6 ounces processed cheese, grated<br> Instructions: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef, garlic powder, black pepper and onion, crumbling the beef as you cook it, until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off any excess grease but do not clean the skillet. To the same skillet, add the beef broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, chili powder, paprika, cumin, hot sauce and some salt. Smash the tomatoes into small bits as you stir. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Use an immersion blender to puree the sauce. Simmer for 1 hour. After 1 hour, mix the cornstarch with 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Add the slurry to the sauce. Raise the heat to medium high and let it boil and thicken for 3 minutes. Return the beef to the pan and stir. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Soften the tortillas in the microwave, wrapped in a paper towel, for 15 to 45 seconds, depending on your microwave. Mix together all 3 cheeses in a bowl. Place a couple of tablespoons of cheese in the center of each tortilla, making a line down the center. Roll each tortilla up and place it seam-side down in a 9-by-13-inch pan. Once all the tortillas are in the pan, spoon or ladle the sauce over the top of them. Top with the leftover cheese and bake until bubbly, about 18 minutes. To make ahead: Assemble the tortillas in the pan and cover with plastic wrap. Put the cooled sauce in an airtight container. Keep the extra cheese for topping in another container. Throw everything into the fridge. When ready to cook, top the tortillas with the sauce and cheese and bake! &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 49392,&quot;Cracked Chocolate Earth with Whipped Cream (Flourless Chocolate Cake) 1 pound bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces 1 stick unsalted butter (see Cook&#39;s Note) 9 large eggs, separated 3/4 cup granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon 2 cups heavy cream, cold Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch springform pan. Put the chocolate and butter into the top of a double boiler (or in a heatproof bowl) and heat over (but not touching) about 1 inch of simmering water until melted. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar in a mixing bowl until light yellow in color. Whisk a little of the chocolate mixture into the egg yolk mixture to temper the eggs - this will keep the eggs from scrambling from the heat of the chocolate; then whisk in the rest of the chocolate mixture. Beat the egg whites in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form and fold into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared pan (spray the bottom with nonstick spray) and bake until the cake is set, the top starts to crack, and a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out with moist crumbs clinging to it, 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes, then unmold. While the cake is cooking, make the whipped cream. Whip the cream until it becomes light and fluffy. Dust the cake with confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve at room temperature with the whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 49393,&quot;Lemon Rice 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 small yellow onion, finely diced<br> 2 cups long-grain white rice<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice<br> 3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, plus more for garnish<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, taking care not to let them color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil. Add 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, then cover and cook until all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and fluff with a fork to separate the grains. Let sit, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice and mint to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Serve hot, garnished with chopped mint. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 49394,&quot;Carrot Ice Cream Cake About 10 ounces oil About 15 ounces sugar 4 eggs About 10 ounces all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 cups organic carrots (about 3 large) 8 1/2 ounces pineapple (1 large golden pineapple) 1 cup hickory nuts 1 liter milk About 17 to 18 ounces cream About 14 ounces sugar, divided About 5 ounces glucose 1/2 teaspoon salt Cream cheese or (recommended: Brilliant Savarin Cheese) 30 egg yolks About 17 to 18 ounces carrot reduction (need 30 large carrots) About 3 1/2 ounces pineapple reduction (need 1 large pineapple) About 17 to 18 ounces milk 8 ounces heavy cream About 8 1/2 ounces sugar About 3 1/2 ounces dry milk About 4 1/2 ounces dry glucose About 1/4-ounce ice cream stabilizer About 2.2 pounds fresh pineapple puree (2 large golden pineapples) About 8 1/2 ounces sugar About 1/4-ounce Pectin NH (found in specialty stores) Pinch salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract White Chocolate Spray: About 17 to 18 ounces cocoa butter About 22 ounces white chocolate (recommended: Valhrona) About 3 1/2 ounces glucose About 7 ounces fondant icing 1 cup whole hickory nuts, toasted Toothpicks Masking tape About 17 to 18 ounces white tempered chocolate Instructions: For the Carrot Cake: In a kitchen aid bowl, with paddle attachment, add the oil and sugar. Mix well, about 1 minute. Add the eggs to the bowl and mix. Once the eggs are mixed, sift the dry ingredients and add to the bowl. Mix until incorporated. When the flour has been mixed, add the carrots, drained pineapple and nuts. Mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Pour the mixture onto a full sized sheet pan that has been lined with a silpat. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and bake until golden brown, approximately 10 minutes, rotating at the halfway point. Cool the cake to room temperature then place in the freezer to chill. For the Cheese Ice Cream: Place the milk, cream, half of the sugar, glucose and salt in a saucepan. Bring it to a simmer. While this is heating, crack the yolks, and place the other half of the sugar to the side. Place the cheese in a bain marie that has an ice bath nearby. Once the milks are hot, whisk the sugar into the yolks, temper the eggs with the hot milk, and stir. Place it back in the pan, and onto medium heat. Cook the ice cream until thickened enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Pour the anglaise into the bain marie, over the cheese. Allow it to cool completely, then burmix the anglaise and strain it through a fine sieve. Pour into your ice cream machine and chill in freezer for at least 1 hour. For the Carrot Ice Cream: Begin by peeling and juicing approximately 30 carrots. Using a juicer, juice the carrots to yield 2 liters juice. Cook the carrot juice until reduced to about 17 to 18 ounces. It should have become thick. Juice 1 pineapple with a juicer and then just like the carrot juice, cook it until reduced to 3 1/2 ounces. To begin the ice cream, place the milk and cream in a saucepan. Mix together the sugar, dry milk, dry glucose and stabilizer. Whisk it into the milks. Cook the mixture to 185 degrees F. While the mixture is heating pour the carrot juice and pineapple into a bain marie with an ice bath. Pour the mixture over the juices and cool completely. Strain through a chinois and put in ice cream machine. Freeze for at least 1 hour. For the Pineapple Chips: With the left over pulp from the grated pineapple from the carrot cake, place it into the blender and puree. Pat the chips out onto a silpat and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Preheat the oven to 210 degrees F. Place the chips into the oven for at least 2 hours. Once the chips are dry, take the chips out of the oven, and turn the temperature up. Using a small wooden dowel, heat the chips until pliable and roll the chips around the dowel and then pull them off. Cool, set aside. For the Pineapple Sauce: Using fresh Pineapple, peel 2 pineapples, cut them up and remove the core. Place it into the blender and puree until smooth. Strain the puree through a chinois. Mix the sugar, pectin and salt. In a pan combine the puree with the sugar and pectin and add the vanilla. Cook on medium heat until thick, approximately 3 minutes after it comes to a simmer. Strain the sauce and put into a bain marie to cool completely. Place in a squeeze bottle. For the White Chocolate Spray: Heat the cocoa butter until melted in the microwave. Heat the white chocolate separately in the microwave until melted. Now that the 2 are melted, burmix them together and mix in the vanilla and salt. Strain through a chinois. Keep in a warm place until ready to spray your cake. For the Fondant Sugar Work: Place the glucose and fondant together in a small pan, and cook until pale golden. Pour it into a small glass bowl. Allow to cool but not set up. For the Hickory Nut Sugar Spears: While cooling pierce 6 hickory nuts with toothpicks. Place a piece of masking tape up on the edge of a table or the edge of a shelf. Dip the nut into the sugar and stick the toothpick into the masking tape so that it can hang and the sugar drips and it cools. Cut it however long you want your spear. Assemble the cake: Now that the cake is frozen, cut out pieces of cake using a 6-inch cake ring. With large cookie cutters cut out 2 more circles that are 4 inches in diameter. Place the cake ring on a cardboard that is the same size. Line the ring with a piece of acetate. Place the largest piece of cake on the bottom. Paddle the cheese ice cream in a kitchen aid bowl to soften it. Place it into a piping bag and pipe around the base of the cake and all the way up the sides of the ring. Just so the sides of the ring are covered with ice cream. Allow it to chill 5 minutes. Paddle the carrot ice cream the same way, and place it into a piping bag. Pipe a layer of ice cream over the cake. Place it into the freezer 10 minutes. Place another layer of cake, and repeat with ice cream. Place it into the freezer for 10 minutes. Pipe a thin layer of pineapple sauce over the ice cream. Allow to freeze for 10 minutes. Pipe a layer of cheese ice cream over the sauce. Freeze for 10 minutes. Place the last cake over, and pipe the cheese ice cream on the top to finish. With an off-set long metal spatula, smooth out the top. Allow the cake to freeze for at least 1 hour. Once frozen, pull out the cake, remove the ring and the acetate. Smooth out the sides. Prepare to spray the cake with the white chocolate spray. Once the cake is sprayed, place it into the freezer while tempering chocolate. Temper chocolate and spread onto transfer sheet, cut as desired. Place the tempered chocolate on the outside of the cake, adhering it by using honey. Garnish the top with pineapple sauce and hickory nut spears. Serve with pineapple sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49395,&quot;Shabbat Coffee Cake with Red Wine-Soaked Prunes 10 ounces pitted prunes 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 1/4 cups dry red wine 1 cinnamon stick, optional 1 1/2 cups (190 grams) all-purpose flour, such as King Arthur 3/4 cup (140 grams) packed dark brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 8 tablespoons (114 grams) unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 8 tablespoons (114 grams) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 2 1/4 cups (273 grams) all-purpose flour, such as King Arthur 2 teaspoons (8 grams) baking powder\\u202f 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) baking soda 1 teaspoon (3 grams) kosher salt, such as Diamond Crystal (if using Morton\\u2019s, use 1/2 teaspoon) 1 1/2 cups (281 grams) granulated sugar 1 tablespoon (11 grams) vanilla extract Seeds of 1 vanilla pod 2 large eggs 1 1/3 cups (304 grams) full-fat sour cream\\u202f 3 tablespoons powdered sugar, to garnish Instructions: For the prunes: In a small pot, combine the prunes, granulated sugar, wine and cinnamon stick if using. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the wine reduces by about a quarter and the mixture becomes syrupy, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the prunes cool to room temperature. Transfer to a container, cover and refrigerate until you\\u2019re ready to make the cake. (You can do this up to a week ahead of time and keep them chilled until ready to use.) For the streusel topping: Combine the flour, dark brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a mixing bowl. Break up any lumps of sugar with your hands, and then mix to evenly distribute all the ingredients. Add the melted butter and vanilla, and with a fork, gently mix the mixture together until large crumbles form. Use your hands and continue to gently mix until the topping is in crumbled bits ranging in size from a small marble to a lentil. Cover and place the streusel in the refrigerator to chill while you mix the cake. For the cake: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch springform pan with a circle of parchment paper and then butter the bottom and sides with 1 tablespoon of the softened butter. Set aside. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and baking soda. Mix in the salt and set aside. In another mixing bowl, cream together the remaining 7 tablespoons of butter with the granulated sugar, vanilla extract and vanilla seeds. I like to do this with a large, stiff spatula, or a wooden spoon, beating the mixture for 2 minutes. Add the eggs and mix to fully combine. Add the sifted dry ingredients to the butter mixture, and gently fold them together until uniform. Last, add the sour cream and gently fold it through the batter until just combined. A few streaks is ok; you don\\u2019t want to overmix it. Remove the prunes from the red wine syrup, straining off the liquid. Save the liquid for later! It\\u2019s great drizzled on fruit or ice cream. Roughly chop the prunes and set aside. Transfer half of the batter to the prepared pan, and smooth it out into an even layer with a spatula. Add the chopped prunes in an even layer and then cover with the remaining batter, smoothing it out into an even layer. Remove the streusel from the fridge and gently break up any large clusters with your hands. Top the cake with the streusel crumbles in an even layer. Bake until set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with just a few moist crumbs, 50 to 55 minutes. Allow the cake to cool in the pan on a heatproof surface for at least 1 hour. Release the outer ring of the springform pan, running a butter knife around the edges if the cake seems to stick in any areas. I like to leave the cake on the bottom round of the pan for easy serving. Place the coffee cake on a serving platter or cake stand and using a small, fine strainer, dust the powdered sugar all over the top of the cake. Slice and enjoy.

Combine the tablespoon each butter and flour to make a paste. Spread some over a cookie sheet and set aside. Combine egg whites, milk, vanilla, and salt and let sit until room temperature. (You can speed the process by slightly warming mixture over a pan of hot water.) Add melted butter to egg white mixture. Whisk in sugar until evenly blended. Add flour and whisk until smooth. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons batter per cookie onto prepared cookie sheet. Allow six inches for spreading; each sheet will hold 3 cookies. With a spatula, spread each blob of batter out to form a thin 5-inch circle, leaving about an inch between cookies. Scatter some almonds over batter. Bake about three to five minutes, until lightly golden all over. Slide a long spatula under each cookie, carefully lift off and immediately place cookie over an inverted coffee cup or custard cup. Cover with a dry cloth and press down to mold into a fluted shell. Repeat with other cookies. Shells will stiffen in 1 to 2 minutes. Recoat baking sheet and repeat spreading, baking, and molding process until all cookies are baked. Serve immediately or store in airtight tins. It takes some practice to get the knack of molding these thin, crisp cookies. They make a delightful \\bowl\\ for ice cream or sorbets. These cookies can also be cooled curved over a rolling pin for tuiles, or tile-shaped cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 49398,&quot;Death by Chocolate Cookies 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda One 3.9-ounce packet instant chocolate pudding 2 large eggs 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips 2 cups crushed salted pretzel rods Cooking spray, for greasing Flaky sea salt, for serving Frozen whipped topping, such as Cool Whip, for serving Instructions: Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Whisk together the butter, both sugars, vanilla and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the baking powder, baking soda and chocolate pudding. Add the eggs, one at a time, using a wooden spoon to mix well after each addition. Stir in the flour, chocolate chips and pretzels. Lightly spray a 1/2-cup measuring cup with cooking spray. Fill the measuring cup with dough, pressing it in until the dough takes on a biscuit shape. Unmold the biscuit into a cast-iron pan and repeat with the remaining dough until you have 8 cookies. Place the skillet over indirect heat, close the grill and bake, about 30 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). Remove the pan from the grill and sprinkle the cookies with flaky sea salt. Serve with scoops of frozen whipped topping.

Melt butter in an 8 to 10-inch oven-proof saute pan and then add shallots. Transfer to oven and roast until lightly browned, stirring often. Remove pan from oven and set aside. Over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a 6-inch saute pan. Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds; do not let garlic color. Add mushrooms and saute until browned. Carefully add brandy and flambe. Remove pan from heat immediately when flames subside. Stir in herbs and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. Place the cream, eggs, pecans, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a blender with the sauteed shallots (make sure to scrape the pan with a rubber spatula). Blend on high speed for about 20 seconds. Set aside. Mix the cream mixture with the toasted pecans, bread cubes, and mushroom mixture. Mix well and refrigerate for about 1 hour, stirring every once in a while so that the bread fully absorbs the flambeed mixture. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Melt butter and then thoroughly brush the inside of 6 individual-sized ramekins. (It&#39;s best to use cool ramekins because the butter sticks better and forms a thicker coat).

Spray the bottom and sides lightly with cooking spray. Set aside. Shred the zucchini on the large holes of a box grater, then transfer to a large bowl. Sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and several grinds of pepper and toss well. Let sit until softened and starting to release some of its natural juices, about 5 minutes. Transfer the shredded zucchini to a clean kitchen towel or damp cheesecloth, then squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible. Reserving the liquid for another use (see Cook\\u2019s Note), wipe out the large bowl. Whisk the eggs, 1/3 cup of the Parmesan, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and several grinds of pepper in the same large bowl until combined. Stir in the zucchini until evenly dispersed throughout the egg mixture. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, spreading the mixture into a thin, even layer. Bake until just set and opaque (there shouldn\\u2019t be any browning), about 20 minutes. Let it cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then invert onto a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and carefully remove the parchment. Starting at one of the longer ends, roll up the egg-zucchini shell and the towel together into a spiral. Transfer seam-side down to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the cream cheese, scallions, a good pinch of salt and remaining 3 tablespoons Parmesan in a small bowl until smooth and combined. Set aside at room temperature until ready to assemble. Unroll the room temperature egg-zucchini shell, then use an offset spatula to spread on the cream cheese mixture into a thin, even layer. Next, lay the prosciutto slices down on top in an even layer (the cheese should be almost completely covered). Reroll tightly without the towel.

Fit a wire rack in a baking sheet; set aside. In a large pot, heat 2 inches of vegetable oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F. Make the batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, cayenne, paprika, baking powder and pepper. Add the beer and whisk until smooth. Working in 2 to 3 batches, coat the fish in the batter. Carefully transfer the battered fish to the hot oil. Fry each batch for 4 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove the fried fish to the wire rack on the baking sheet to allow the oil to drain away. This will ensure it stays crispy. Transfer the baking sheet with the fish to the oven to keep warm while you get everything else ready. The fish can sit in the oven up to an hour staying warm. For serving: Wrap the tortillas in foil and place in the oven to warm for 10 minutes. Unwrap the tortillas and serve alongside the fish and all the fixings: cabbage, red onion, cilantro, lime wedges and Charred Lime Crema. Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Toss the jalapenos and onion rounds in the olive oil in a bowl. Grill the jalapenos and onion rounds until charred all over, turning as needed, about 5 minutes total. Place the jalapenos in a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap for 10 minutes. Set the onions aside. Cut the jalapenos in half, remove the stems and seeds and gently scrape off the charred skin. Roughly chop the grilled onion rounds. Combine the jalapenos, onion, cilantro and some salt and pepper in a food processor. Pulse in 2-second increments until finely minced. Whisk together the crema and lime zest and juice in a medium bowl. Add the jalapeno-onion mixture to the bowl with the crema and fold everything together until fully incorporated.

Roast 15 minutes, rotate the baking sheet and baste with more glaze. Roast until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is crispy, another 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 49424,&quot;Pizza with Blue Cheese, Butternut Squash, and Fried Sage Leaves 1 small butternut squash (1 pound) 4 tablespoons olive oil salt and freshly ground pepper 1 clove garlic, minced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 15 fresh sage leaves 5 ounces Gruyere cheese, such as Roth Kase, Fontina, Gouda or Emmentaler 4 ounces blue cheese, such as Great Hill Blue, crumbled dough for one 14-inch pizza, recipe below 1 to 2 tablespoons cornmeal About 3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 envelope active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 1 1/2 cups warm (110 degrees F.) water 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. If using, place a pizza stone in the oven.<br> Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Hold one half on its end, and with a sharp knife, shave the tough peel. Remove the seeds and pith. Set the squash flat side down and cut into 1/4 inch thick slices. Repeat with the other half, or until you have 2 cups sliced squash.<br> Spread the squash out on an oiled baking sheet. Brush it liberally with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until soft. It is okay if the squash is slightly underdone since it will continue to cook on top of the pizza.<br> Remove from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees F.<br> In a small saute pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to darken, remove the pan from the stove and toss in the garlic, swirling it around to caramelize it. Set aside.<br> In another small saute pan, heat the butter over high heat. When it begins to bubble, add the sage leaves and cook for 30 seconds. Watch carefully, the leaves can easily burn. Remove from the butter and drain on a paper towel.<br> Dust the pizza pan with cornmeal. Stretch the dough out on the pan, using your fingers to stretch it from the center toward the edges. (Since the dough is very loose and pliable, this takes a little patience.) The middle of the dough will be paper-thin. Brush it liberally with the garlic oil. Sprinkle the Gruyere cheese over the dough. Arrange the squash slices in concentric circles over the cheese, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Bake for 15 mintues. Remove from the oven and top with blue cheese and sage leaves, placing the leaves decoratively on the pizza. Continue baking until the cheese is bubbling and the edges of the crust have browned, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and serve immediately. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, until it becomes foamy.<br> In a large bowl, mix together the oil and the salt. Add the yeast mixture and stir well. Slowly add 3 cups of the flour and mix until the dough sticks together but isn&#39;t too dry. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead in the remaining 1/2 cup flour, or as much as you need until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. (For a thinner crust, use slightly less flour. The dough will be a little stickier, however.)<br> Form the dough into a ball and place it in an oiled bowl, turning once to coat the dough with oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a towel and set in a warm place. Let rise until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.<br> Divide the dough into two balls. Let rest, covered, for 15 minutes. Proceed according to individual recipe. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 49425,&quot;Easy Vegetable Bolognese with Spaghetti Squash One 3- to 4-pound spaghetti squash Extra-virgin olive oil, for the pot and drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped<br> 1 large carrot, cut into chunks 1 celery stalk, cut into chunks 1 large yellow onion, roughly chopped 1 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered<br> 1 large zucchini, trimmed and cut into chunks 1/2 cup milk<br> 3/4 cup red wine, such as pinot noir<br> One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, torn, plus more for serving 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> One 2- to 3-ounce piece Parmesan rind plus freshly grated Parmesan, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

Turn the squash cut-side down and bake until a fork easily pulls the \\u201cspaghetti\\u201d strands away from the squash, about 40 minutes. In the meantime, start the sauce. Heat a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat and add enough olive oil to coat the base of the pot, about 2 tablespoons. Add the garlic, carrot, celery and onion to a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pulse the vegetables until finely chopped. Add the vegetables to the heated pot and season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Saut the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until they soften, about 5 minutes. Re-attach the food processor bowl and add the mushrooms and zucchini. Pulse the vegetables until finely chopped but still with some texture. Add them to the pot with the other vegetables. Season with another 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and their natural liquid has mostly evaporated, 7 to 10 minutes.

Cover and set aside. For the breaded jalape?os: Cut the jalape?os into 1/4-inch slices, removing the stems. Place in a small bowl and add the buttermilk. Cover and soak the jalape?os at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerated up to 48 hours. Drain off the buttermilk and add the jalape?os to a bowl with the flour. With gloved hands, mix the jalape?os into the flour making sure they are well coated. Let them rest in the flour for 5 to 7 minutes, then sift off the excess flour to prepare for frying. (This resting time helps the flour to hold to the jalape?os during frying.) In a small saucepan, heat the oil to 325 degrees F. Add the jalape?os to the oil and fry, gently turning and mixing the jalape?os to ensure even cooking, until they are light golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Strain from the oil and place on paper towels. For the burgers: In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders, seafood seasoning and seasoned salt. Set aside. Form eight 1/4-pound patties from the meat. Sprinkle the seasoning on one side of each of the patties. Heat a griddle to medium-high heat (or a large frying pan, or grill). Cook the patties 2 minutes on each side or to the desired doneness. To assemble the burgers, stack 2 cooked patties on each bun, then top with 1 to 2 tablespoons cream cheese, 6 to 7 slices of fried jalape?os and 1 to 2 tablespoons of pepper jelly.

Cut the pork into 1-inch cubes, then arrange on a baking sheet in a single layer and pop into the freezer for 10 minutes. It is important to make sure that all the ingredients and equipment are very cold to make the grinding easier and yield a smoother texture. Put the chicken stock in a large pot and heat to steam but not simmer. Line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Place the bowl from an electric stand mixer under the grinder. Put the chilled attachments in place, using a medium-hole grinding plate. Run the cubed pork through the grinder, working carefully and quickly. We want the meat to stay as cold as possible. Gently spread the ground meat all over the bottom of the bowl and up the sides a little. This will help you to distribute the seasonings evenly. Sprinkle with the salt, Parmigiano-Reggiano, milk powder, fennel seeds and red pepper flakes. Add the garlic. Place the mixer bowl on the machine fitted with the paddle attachment. Turn the machine to low and pour the wine down the side of the bowl to incorporate, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture becomes sticky, 2 to 3 minutes. Stop the machine. To test for seasoning, make 1 small sausage patty, about 2 inches in diameter. Heat the canola oil in a small skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat (to avoid splattering) and add the meat patty. Turn the heat back on and brown on both sides for a few minutes until cooked through but still pink in the middle. Taste the cooked sausage for seasoning and adjust the meat mixture if necessary. Place the hog casings gently on the extruder tube of the sausage maker. Imagine you are gently putting a sock on your foot and push several layers of the casing to wrap around the tube. Don&#39;t let the casings bunch up or become too tight. Start the extruder and load the meat mix into the top. Let a little of the meat go into the casing, taking care that there are no gaps or pockets. Press the casing around the meat so they hug each other. Go slowly. Stop every 3 1/2 to 4 inches or so, cut the end closest to the extruder, twist and tie off the ends with twine to make a link. If the casing breaks, take the meat out, put a fresh casing on the extruder and start again. Gently drop the sausages into the hot, steaming stock in a single layer. Let them cook gently without boiling, turning them halfway through, until no longer pink in the middle, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked sausages to the sheet tray lined with paper towels and let them cool and dry for 10 to 15 minutes. For the slaw: Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, hot sauce and Worcestershire in a bowl. Add the cabbage and stir to coat. Season with salt and stir in the parsley. For the honey-mustard sauce: Whisk the mustard and honey together in a bowl. Season with salt to taste. Heat a grill pan to medium high. Coat the sausages in a small amount of oil and lay them on the grill pan. Grill on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes total. Drizzle oil over the inside of the rolls and toast on both sides over medium-high heat on the grill pan. Place a grilled sausage link on a toasted roll, spread with honey mustard and top with the cabbage slaw.

When it boils, remove from the heat and let steep for 5 minutes. Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl until light and fluffy. Whisk in the cornstarch until smooth. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk mixture and discard. Carefully whisk 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks until incorporated, then whisk the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is gently bubbling and thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Transfer the mixture to a glass or metal bowl and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic directly against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve.<br> For the pastry: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Combine 1 cup water, the butter, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When the mixture boils, immediately add all the flour at once and stir with a wooden spoon until it is fully incorporated and smooth, 1 minute. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 30 seconds more. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed add the eggs 1 egg at a time, mixing well after each addition, until they are completely incorporated and the mixture is thick and smooth.<br> Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. Pipe 2-inch lengths of dough onto the prepared baking sheet leaving about 1/2 inch between each. To make smooth eclairs, dip your finger in water and smooth out any bumps or points in the dough. Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake until the eclair shells are puffed up and golden brown, about 30 minutes more. Place the eclairs on a wire rack and let cool completely on the baking sheet. Transfer the chilled pastry cream to a pastry bag fitted with small plain tip. Use the tip to gently poke a hole into one end of each eclair shell. Pipe the custard into the eclairs until they are just filled (do not overfill). Alternatively, you may split each eclair open with a knife so that it opens like a book and spoon in the filling.<br> For the glaze: Place 1 cup of confectioners&#39; sugar in each of 3 medium bowls. Whisk the orange juice concentrate and water in to one, the cranberry-raspberry juice into one and the Concord grape juice and water in to one, mixing until smooth. Dip the top of each filled eclair into a glaze, letting the excess drip off before turning over and placing on a platter. Let the eclairs rest until the glaze dries and is shiny, 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49472,&quot;Chocolate Stout Cupcakes with Gingerbread-Spice Swiss Buttercream 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cubed 1/3 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa 1/3 cup stout, such as Guinness, flat 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 9 large egg whites, at room temperature 1 1/2 pounds (6 sticks) unsalted butter, cubed, at room temperature Sugar flowers, optional Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the muffin tin with cupcake liners. Put the butter, cocoa and stout in a microwave-safe bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and microwave until the butter melts, about 2 minutes. Whisk to combine. Meanwhile, whisk the granulated sugar, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the sour cream, vanilla and eggs together in a small bowl. Whisk the cocoa mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir in the sour cream mixture just until combined, being careful to avoid over-mixing. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin tins, filling each about three-quarters full, or about 1/4-cup per cupcake. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcakes comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely in the tin on a cooling rack, about 15 minutes. Remove from the liners and return the cupcakes to the rack. For the frosting: Place the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and egg whites in a large metal mixing bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Whisk constantly until the sugar melts and the mixture is very thin and warm. Remove the bowl from the heat and transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Continue beating on low speed until cool. With the mixer set to medium speed, beat the butter a few pieces at a time. The mixture may curdle before coming together. Using a spoon, offset spatula or piping bag, dollop, spread or pipe about 1/2 cup of the frosting on each cupcake. Occasionally beat the frosting to maintain the smooth texture. Decorate with sugar flowers if using and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 49473,&quot;Red, White and Blue Cheesecake 2 cups graham cracker crumbs (from about 18 whole crackers) 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons sugar Pinch fine salt Three 11.5-ounce containers whipped cream cheese 1 1/4 cups sugar One 16-ounce container sour cream, at room temperature 1 cup heavy cream 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 teaspoon red gel food coloring (or to desired color) 1/2 teaspoon blue gel food coloring (or to desired color) Instructions: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F.

Add the heavy cream and beat until just combined. Mix in the eggs, by hand, 1 at time. Mix in the vanilla and lemon juice, by hand, until just combined. (Take care not to overmix, or the cheesecake will turn into a souffl!).<br> Ladle out 2 cups of cheesecake batter and divide between 2 bowls. Color 1 bowl with red food coloring and 1 with blue food coloring. Leave the remaining batter white.<br> Use an ice cream scoop or large spoon, and drop scoopfuls of the batter onto the crust, alternating between the different colors until all the batter is gone. Use a long wooden skewer and drag it through the batter, making sure the skewer reaches down to the bottom of the pan, in 4 swipes, to marble the colors for a tie dye effect. Transfer the springform pan to the roasting pan. Add enough hot water to come about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake until the outside of the cake is set, but the center is still slightly loose, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in the oven for another hour. Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan to a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge and cool to room temperature.

Rinse and pat dry. Line a sheet pan with paper towels and arrange the shrimp on top. Sprinkle with the cocoa powder, curry powder and lemon pepper. Refrigerate for 10 minutes to allow the seasoning to be absorbed. Mix together the beer and the self-rising flour in a bowl to make a batter. Add the all-purpose flour to another bowl, and the coconut to a third. Arrange the bowls in a row so that the flour bowl is first, batter bowl second and coconut bowl third. Line a sheet pan with wax paper. Dip each shrimp into the flour, followed by the batter and finally the coconut, pressing down lightly so that the coconut adheres to the shrimp. Transfer the dressed shrimp to the lined sheet pan. Refrigerate at least 10 minutes and up to 4 hours. Once ready, line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Add 1 tablespoon oil to a 12-inch skillet. Heat the oil until it is shimmering and hot enough to pan-fry the shrimp. Add 6 to 7 of the battered shrimp and cook until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to the lined plate to absorb excess oil. Continue until all the shrimp are cooked, adding more oil as needed. For the tropical rice: Stir the Pineapple Mango Salsa, coconut and lemon zest into the rice and serve immediately with the shrimp.<br> Combine the mango, pineapple, tomato, onion, lemon juice, oil, vinegar, green pepper, parsley, jalape?o, garlic, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl.

In a saute pan, melt the butter and add the brown sugar and vanilla beans. Cook to caramelize the sugar; then place the pineapple in and cook on all sides until brown. Add some water to the pan and continue cooking, turning the pineapple with tongs and basting occasionally until cooked through to the core. It may take 1 hour or more. Chill, then slice thin on an electric slicer set on #12 or slice thinly by hand. For the Coconut Cilantro Dressing: Whisk the ingredients together and chill. For the Macadamia Nut Brittle: In a saucepan, boil the sugar and water together to make a caramel. Test the color of the caramel on a white plate--you&#39;re looking for a topaz color. Turn off the heat and stir in the butter with a wooden spoon then stir in the nuts. Pour onto a silicone baking mat and let cool. Chop and keep in an airtight container. For the Crystallized Cilantro Leaves: Place egg white in a small bowl and whisk it slightly to break it up a bit. Dip the individual leaves in the egg white and wipe them off on the edge of the bowl to remove any excess. Dip into granulated sugar on both sides. Let dry. For the Coconut Butter Cookies: In a mixer with a paddle attachment, whip the butter until very light and fluffy, warming the bottom of the bowl with a torch if needed. Add the sugar and continue whipping; then add the rum and vanilla and mix. Toss together the coconut, flour, and salt; then add to the butter mixture and mix until blended. Butter a small sheet pan and line it with plastic all the way up the sides. Spread the dough evenly into the pan, cover it with plastic and freeze. Cut into 2-inch strips and roll in flour. Wrap and freeze or cut into 1/8-inch bars and place on parchment lined sheet pan. Bake in a preheated 250 degree F. oven until crisp but barely any color, about 10 minutes. Let cool. To make the Coconut Strips: Heat a whole coconut over a gas flame to slightly char all sides. Wrap it in a tea towel and whack it on the floor to break it open. Carefully pry the meat from the shell in as whole pieces as possible. With a vegetable peeler, peel off thin strips of the fresh coconut meat to end up with curves of fresh coconut. Store in simple syrup, chilled to cover. To serve the dish: Place 5 to 7 slices of pineapple on a plate in a flower pattern, with 1 in the center, surrounded by the others. Brush the surface of all the slices with the coconut cilantro dressing. Cover the plate with plastic wrap and warm it in the microwave oven for about 1 minute. Remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper and macadamia nut brittle. Place a quenelle of lime sherbet in the middle and drape coconut shavings in an X over the sherbet. Place 2 crystallized cilantro leaves on top. Serve with a side of coconut shortbread cookies using colorful origami paper under the cookies and stacking them in a criss-cross tower, like bruscetta with the carpaccio. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49476,&quot;Northwest Indiana Style Smash Burger 1 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped gherkins<br> 1 tablespoon ketchup<br> 1 tablespoon sriracha<br> 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br> 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1 1/2 pounds ground chuck, preferably 70/30 or 80/20, divided into four 6-ounce balls<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Granulated garlic, for sprinkling 8 slices American cheese<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 4 hamburger buns, preferably brioche<br> 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce, or 4 whole leaves<br> 1 beefsteak tomato, sliced<br> Instructions: For the smash sauce: Mix together the mayonnaise, gherkins, ketchup, sriracha, mustard, granulated garlic and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Season to taste. For the burgers: Heat a large flat-surfaced griddle pan to high heat. Add the vegetable oil. Add the balls of meat to the hot griddle and let cook for 15 to 30 seconds. Flip the burgers and, using a trowel or large spatula, smash each ball of meat until about the size of the bun (the overhang is crucial). Smash and schmear down the edges of the beef even further, so that they are a little thinner than the middle. Sprinkle the exposed side with salt, pepper and a little granulated garlic. Cook until super dark and caramelized, 1 to 2 minutes. (The beef will release better when properly caramelized.) Now it&#39;s time to scrape the beef and flip, ideally using a griddle scraper or paint scraper to get up every bit of beef. Immediately top each patty with 2 slices American cheese and sear for another 1 to 2 minutes. Spread 1 tablespoon butter on each burger bun and place on the grill. Cook until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Top each bun with a patty, lettuce, tomato and smash sauce.

Sprinkle salt over the sponge and stir in the olive oil. Mix well. Add white flour, one cup at a time. When the dough is too stiff to stir, turn it out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic. Return the dough to a lightly oiled bread bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until at least double in size, approximately 1 1/2 hours. Gently punch down. Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 5 days or less. If at this time you want to save the dough in the refrigerator for baking later, simply wrap it in a plastic bag that is at least three times the size of the dough, pull the bag together, and secure it just at the opening of the bag. This will give the dough a chance to expand when it is in the refrigerator (which it will do). From day to day, simply cut off the amount of dough you need and keep the rest in the refrigerator, for up to one week. The dough will smell slightly fermented after a few days, but this simply improves the taste of the bread. Dough should be brought to room temperature before baking. This amount of dough will make approximately 16 pitas if rolled out into circles approximately 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1/4-inch thick. You can also of course make smaller breads. Size and shape all depend on you, but for breads of this dimension the following baking tips apply: Place unglazed quarry tiles, or a large baking stone or two baking sheets, on a rack in the bottom third of your oven, leaving a one inch gap all around to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Divide dough in half, then set half aside, covered, while you work with the rest. Divide dough into eight equal pieces and flatten each piece with lightly floured hands. Roll out each piece to a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter. You may wish to roll out all eight before starting to bake. Cover rolled out breads, but do not stack. Bake 2 at a time (or more if your oven is larger) directly on quarry tiles or baking sheets. Bake each bread for 3 or 4 minutes, until the bread has gone into a full \\balloon\\ or until it is starting to turn lightly golden, whichever happens first. If there are seams or dry bits of dough - or for a variety of other reasons - your bread may not go into a full \\balloon. Don&#39;t worry, it will still taste great. The more you bake pitas the more you will become familiar with all the little tricks and pitfalls, and your breads will more consistently \\balloon.\\ But even then, if you&#39;re like us, it won&#39;t always \\balloon\\ fully and you won&#39;t mind because the taste will still be wonderful. When baked, remove, place on a rack for about five minutes to let cool slightly, then wrap breads in a large kitchen towel (this will keep the breads soft). When first half of the dough has been rolled out and baked, repeat for rest of dough, or store in refrigerator for later use, as described above. You can also divide the dough into more, smaller pieces if you wish, to give you smaller breads. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49479,&quot;Prosciutto Standing Rib Roast with Figs 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, roughly chopped 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning 1 (3 to 4-rib) standing rib roast (about 7 to 8 pounds) 8 to 12 pieces prosciutto 15 fresh figs, halved 8 shallots, peeled 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and arrange a rack in the lower third. Combine 1 tablespoon of the oil, garlic, 1 tablespoon salt, rosemary, and 2 teaspoons pepper in a bowl and mix to combine. Rub the mixture all over the roast and set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. (Can be done up to 12 hours ahead. Store covered in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature while oven heats). Overlap the prosciutto on the meaty side of the roast and secure in place with kitchen string, tie the roast by running the string parallel to the bones. Arrange the roast in a large roasting rack, bone side down. Roast until the meat is nicely browned, about 25 minutes. Put the figs and shallots in a bowl and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, vinegar and honey. Season well with salt and pepper, to taste, and toss to coat. Add the fig mixture to the roasting pan, reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, and roast for another 1 hour and 10 minutes. Baste the vegetables occasionally, until the internal temperature registers 115 to 120 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. (Be sure the thermometer is exactly in the center of the roast.) Remove the roast from the oven and transfer it to a cutting board. Cover it tightly with aluminum foil and allow the meat to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove kitchen string, carve, and transfer to a serving platter. Serve with the figs and onions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 49480,&quot;Spiced Red Wine-Poached Pears 2 cups dry red wine, such as cabernet or merlot 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 1 orange, juiced (about 1/2 cup) One 1 by 3-inch strip orange zest 1 cinnamon stick 2 cloves 4 firm, ripe pears Instructions: In a 4-quart saucepan, combine wine, sugar, orange juice, zest, cinnamon stick and cloves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. While liquid is simmering, peel pears, leaving stem intact and being careful not to blemish the flesh of the pears. Slice 1/2-inch off the bottom of the pears to create a flat bottom. Gently place pears in poaching liquid, cover, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes to ensure even color, until pears are cooked but still firm. Remove saucepan from flame, uncover and cool with pears upright in pan. Once cool, cover and chill in refrigerator at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours, turning occasionally, if desired. Gently remove pears from liquid and allow to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, reduce liquid by about half over a medium-high flame for 15 minutes, until liquid is thicker and slightly syrupy. Remove from flame and let liquid come to room temperature. Drizzle each pear with 2 tablespoons syrup and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chianti]&quot; 49481,&quot;L&#39;Osso Buco a l&#39;Orange 2 tablespoons flour Freshly ground salt Freshly ground pepper 4 pounds veal knuckles, sawn into 8 pieces, 1-inch rounds 2 tablespoons clarified butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 medium onions, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed 2 medium carrots, finely chopped 2 large oranges, zest and juice from one and the other peeled and chopped fine 3 1/4 cups dry white wine 1 bouquet garni (1 bay leaf, 4 stalks parsley, 1 sprig thyme, 3-inch piece celery) 1 teaspoon tomato paste Arrowroot (if necessary for thickening) 8 ounces long grain rice, boiled Instructions: Put 2 tablespoons flour into a good plastic bag. Add a little salt and pepper and shake to combine. Wipe veal pieces with a damp cloth to remove any bone dust. Place pieces of veal knuckle into bag and shake to cover each piece with flour. Place clarified butter and oil into a large skillet (frying pan) and heat to 400 degrees F. Place floured veal pieces into the butter/oil. They should foam and fry until golden. Turn to color evenly. Add the onions, garlic, carrots and orange zest. Toss veal pieces and vegetables together and lower heat to 300 degrees F. and allow to \\sweat\\ (the natural oils \\bead\\ out of the vegetables like perspiration) for 3 minutes. Now add 2 cups dry white wine and scrape pan base with wooden \\spurtle\\ or spoon to lift up any sediment into the sauce. Reduce heat to simmer, add the bouquet garni (tie up with string if fresh or in a muslin bag if dried herbs are used) and the tomato paste which you need to stir in well. Simmer with a tight cover for 2 hours - adding another 1 1/4 cups dry white wine. About 30 minutes before serving add the orange juice. When the meat is very tender remove the veal pieces, pass the sauce and vegetables through a strainer and reheat the veal knuckle pieces in the sauce. Correct the seasoning and thicken, if necessary, with a little arrowroot paste. Dish the rice with the orange pieces on a large serving plate. Pile the veal pieces on top and coat with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 49482,&quot;Wild Mushroom Risotto 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons wild leeks, diced (domestic leeks may be used) 1 cup boletus* (wild mushroom), diced 1 cup orange latex milky mushrooms* (wild mushrooms), diced 1/4 cup cream sherry 1 cup Arborio rice 3 cups low-fat chicken stock 1/4 cup Parmesan, grated 1 tablespoon Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped To taste salt and black pepper Instructions: In a saute pan with the olive oil, sweat the leeks and brown the mushrooms lightly.

Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let sit undisturbed at room temperature until the mixture is full of bubbles and has nearly doubled in size, usually 2 to 3 days. During this time, yeasts and bacteria from the air and from the flour and probably from you will set up housekeeping in the bowl (see Cook&#39;s Note). For daily feeding: Peel back any crust that may have formed and transfer 20% of the culture (50 grams) to a clean, wide-mouthed jar. Stir in 100 grams flour and 100 grams water, loosely screw on the lid and stash at room temperature for 24 hours. (The culture will have a stinky-sour smell at this point.) Discard the rest of the original mixture. Repeat step 2 every 24 hours for 5 days. By then the culture should smell yeasty-sweet-sour, which means you&#39;re ready to put the starter to work. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 49486,&quot;Salt Cod Brandade 2 Idaho potatoes 1 pound salt cod, soaked for 24 hours, water changed 3 times<br> 2 cups milk<br> 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 Spanish onion, thinly sliced<br> 2 tablespoons butter<br> 2 tablespoons creme fraiche<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons capers 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh parsley 1 lemon, zest cut into thin strips Crostini, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Be sure your stove is well ventilated! Heat a large (10-inch) cast-iron skillet over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes. Pat the filets dry with paper towels and brush all over with the canola oil. Combine the fleur de sel and cracked pepper on a small plate and roll the filets on the top, bottom and sides in the seasoning, pressing lightly to coat. When the skillet is very hot, add the filets and sear evenly all over (top, bottom and sides) for about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the steaks from the skillet to a sheet pan (set the skillet aside) and place in the oven for 8 to 12 minutes, until the steaks register 120 degrees F on a meat thermometer for medium rare. Remove from the oven, cover the sheet pan tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a medium (8-inch) saute pan over medium-low heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 4 to 5 minutes, until they release their juices. Stir in the sherry and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until the mushrooms are cooked through. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and set aside. At the same time, add the olive oil to the cast-iron skillet (don?t wipe it out), add the shallots and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes.

Using a sharp filet knife (with the blade horizontal to the board), butterfly the roast open about 1 inch from the bottom of the roast. Work carefully to not cut all the way through. Continue to slice horizontally, opening the roast up until you have a large, thin, flat piece of meat. Place the pork in large airtight freezer bag (or large plastic container with a lid). To prepare the brine, bring 6 cups water, the salt, sugar, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, bay leaves and onions to a simmer in a medium pot over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and salt have completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and cool by adding the ice cubes. Pour the brine into the freezer bag, submerging the roast completely, seal and set aside for 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Lay the sausages inside lengthwise. Pierce the casings with the tip of a sharp paring knife (this will ensure the flavor of the sausage goes into the pork as it cooks). Starting with the short side, roll up the roast tightly, jelly roll style. Secure the roast with tightly fitted kitchen twine at even intervals about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, the granulated garlic and paprika.<br> Heat the oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium heat. Add the roast and sear fat-side down first, 3 to 4 minutes, and then on each of the three other sides. When turned to the final side, transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the internal temperature hits 145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove the roast from the oven; rest the pork on a platter while you make gravy from the pan drippings. Set the pan over medium-low heat. Add a little oil, if needed, and saute the onions, carrots and celery. Cook the vegetables until well caramelized, about 8 minutes. Then season with salt and pepper. Deglaze the pan with the vermouth and reduce until the liquid has almost completely reduced. Add the chicken stock and reduce again for another 5 minutes; this will ensure you have a nice, rich sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper.<br> Remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the butter to thicken the sauce. Finish with the lemon zest, a squeeze of lemon juice and serve the sauce over sliced andouille-stuffed pork loin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 49495,&quot;Bacon Bourbon Brussels Sprout Skewers 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/3 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayenne<br> 2/3 cup bourbon<br> 1 pound slab bacon, cut into 1-inch cubes<br> 15 small Brussels sprouts, trimmed (about 1/2 pound)<br> Nonstick cooking spray<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the butter, brown sugar, salt, cayenne and bourbon in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisking constantly, cook until the butter has melted and the mixture has formed a smooth sauce, about 8 minutes. Spread the bacon out on a small baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, just to begin to render the fat. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and simmer until just barely tender and still bright green, 5 minutes. Remove the Brussels sprouts to a baking sheet to cool slightly. Slice each Brussels sprout in half. Preheat a grill pan over medium heat, and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Assemble the skewers: Start by threading a Brussels sprout half onto a skewer, then add a piece of bacon, then another Brussels sprout, followed by another piece of bacon, and finishing with a Brussels sprout. Repeat in this way until all of the skewers are assembled. Brush the skewers lightly with bourbon glaze. Place the skewers on the prepared grill pan and grill, brushing them with glaze with every turn, until the bacon is beginning to crisp and the Brussels sprouts are starting to char, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to a serving platter and serve warm, drizzled with any remaining glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 49496,&quot;Sliced Chipotle Turkey Breast With Pomegranate Cranberry Relish and Polenta 1 full or 2 split skin-on boneless turkey breasts 1 stick butter, softened 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 12-ounce bag fresh cranberries 1 cup sugar 1 cinnamon stick 1 strip orange rind 1 pomegranate 1 jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped 1/2 red onion, finely chopped 2 cups chicken stock, plus 1 cup if reheating for a make-ahead meal 1 cup milk 1 cup quick-cooking polenta 1 cup grated manchego cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the turkey on a baking rack over a baking sheet. Combine 6 tablespoons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the honey and the chipotle puree, and slather over the turkey breast, sprinkling liberally with salt and black pepper. Roast the turkey, 1 hour 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the cranberries in a pot with the sugar, a pinch salt, the cinnamon, orange peel and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until all the berries pop and the sauce thickens, 15 minutes. Let cool. Peel the pomegranate in a bowl of water and separate and drain the seeds. Stir the pomegranate seeds, jalapenos and onions into the sauce. Bring the stock and milk to a boil, and then whisk in the polenta until it thickens. Stir in the remaining butter, some salt and black pepper, the remaining honey and the cheese. Serve the sliced turkey with the cranberry-pomegranate relish, chilled or at room temperature, with the polenta alongside. Cook&#39;s Note: For a make-ahead meal, cool the roasted turkey and store. To reheat, place the turkey in a low baking dish with 1 cup chicken stock and loosely cover with foil. Reheat at 350 degrees F, 20 to 25 minutes, and then crisp up the skin under the broiler.

Line a 15-by-18-inch sheet pan with parchment paper leaving a 2-inch overhang on each of the two narrow ends. Brush with melted butter. Whisk the eggs, cream, cheese and salt in a large bowl. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until the eggs are puffed on the edges and just set, 20 to 25 minutes. Imagine the omelet is divided into three equal sections running lengthwise. Top one section with a layer of the spinach, another with the prosciutto and the last with the peppers; leave a little space between each section. Cover with foil and let sit 10 minutes to allow the spinach to wilt and the toppings to warm. Remove the foil and, using the parchment for handles, carefully transfer the omelet to a cutting board. Starting at one of the short ends, lift the parchment up and use it to help tightly roll up the omelet, pulling the parchment back as you go so it does not get caught in the roll. Using a sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut the omelet into slices and arrange on a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 49499,&quot;Beef Stroganoff 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin, thinly sliced 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons clarified butter 1 cup sliced cremini mushrooms 1/2 cup chopped onion 1/4 cup white wine 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 3 cups demi-glace* 1 1/4 cups sour cream Serving suggestion: egg noodles, cooked.

Drain the coconut milk out over a bowl. Strain it to remove any flecks of shell and reserve it.<br> Place the coconut on the oven rack and bake it until it cracks, about 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Remove the coconut from the oven and let it cool slightly. Remove shell (it will come away easily), then cut the coconut meat into 8 or 10 pieces. With a vegetable peeler, remove brown skin. Coarsely grate 1 cup coconut, either by hand or in the food processor, and reserve it for the filling. Process the remaining coconut until it is very fine.<br> In a large saucepan over low heat, scald the milk until there are bubbles around the edges. Add the finely processed coconut. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool completely. Pour it through a fine strainer into a bowl; press coconut to extract as much moisture as possible.<br> In 3 or 4 batches, place coconut in the corner of a clean dish towel and wring out over bowl to extract all remaining liquid. (If you wish, you can toast the wrung out coconut, though it will have very little flavor remaining after soaking in the milk.) Measure the coconut flavored milk and add more milk, if necessary, to make 2 cups. (This may be done earlier in the day or even the day before and set aside tightly covered in the refrigerator.) Pour into a bowl and whisk in sugar, eggs, vanilla and nutmeg and the reserved coconut milk. Stir in the reserved coarsely grated coconut.<br> Set a rack in the lowest level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Roll out the dough for the bottom crust and arrange in pan.<br> Pour filling into pie crust. Bake the pie for about 45 minutes, until the crust is baked through and the filling is set, but not over-cooked. After the pie has baked for 30 minutes, check it frequently so it does not over-cook. Once the pie is wobbly textured when the pan is gently shaken, remove it from the oven; it will continue to cook for a few minutes longer after it is removed from the oven. If the pie is over baked, it will be heavy and watery. Cool the pie on a rack.<br> To mix the dough by hand, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a medium mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Occasionally reach down to the bottom of the bowl and mix all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Beat the egg(s) in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter mixture. Stir in with a fork until the dough begins to hold together, but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform.<br> To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all. Add the egg(s) to the work bowl and pulse ten times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. Press the dough into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough). Sandwich the disk(s) of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press it into a 6-inch circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour.<br> Storage: Keep the dough in the refrigerator up to two days, or freeze it double-wrapped in plastic. Because the dough is thin, it will defrost quickly at room temperature when you intend to use it.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49506,&quot;Vodka and Cream Marinara Sauce One 24-ounce jar marinara sauce 1/2 cup vodka<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> Instructions: Heat the marinara sauce and vodka in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and pour in the ice water; work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. To make the filling: combine the peaches, blueberries, lemon juice, sugar, and flour in a large mixing bowl. Toss the mixture gently to coat the fruit. Prepare your wooden burning brick oven according to manufacturer&#39;s directions or place a pizza stone in a conventional oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick; it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect, free-form is the look you want for this rustic tart. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured pizza paddle. Spoon the fruit mixture into the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border all around; brush the border with the egg wash. Lift the edge of crust over the filling, leaving the fruit exposed in center. Gently fold and pinch the dough to seal any cracks. Brush the crust with the remaining egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake the crostata directly on the brick oven floor towards the front or on the preheated pizza stone for 30 to 40 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and fruit is bubbly and tender. Slide a pizza paddle under the tart to remove it from the oven. Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 49509,&quot;Double Berry-Hazelnut Crumble 1 stick unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the baking dish 4 cups blackberries 4 cups blueberries 1/2 cup maple syrup 1/3 cup instant tapioca 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Pinch of salt 2/3 cup blanched hazelnuts 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

In another medium bowl, briskly whisk the eggs, sugar and melted butter together until smooth and evenly combined. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg mixture. Gradually whisk the liquid into the flour to make a thick batter. When the pizelle batter starts to clump up in the whisk, switch to a rubber spatula to finish mixing it together. (If you have a large pastry bag, put a big round tip in it, and fill with the pizelle batter.) Preheat a pizzelle iron until a drop of water sizzles on the hot surface, about 10 minutes. Lightly spray the hot surface with nonstick cooking spray. Pipe or spoon about a tablespoon of the batter into the center of each cookie imprint. Close the iron and cook until whiffs of steam comes from the iron, about 30 to 45 seconds. Open and remove cookie from the iron, cool on a rack. Repeat with remaining batter. Put the chocolate and butter in a microwave safe bowl. Cover and microwave on medium power until soft and melted, about 3 minutes depending on the power of your oven; stir until smooth.

Combine the cardamom, coriander, lavender, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle the skin side of the duck breasts with the spice mixture. Allow the duck breasts to sit in the refrigerator, uncovered, for 2 days. This will allow the skin to dry slightly, yielding a crispier result. Remove from the refrigerator and let the duck breasts sit at room temperature for 1 hour before cooking. Place the duck breasts skin-side down in a nonstick pan and begin to cook over a low to medium heat. Let cook, allowing the skin to render its fat and draining it off occasionally, until the skin is fully rendered, brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Flip the duck breasts over in the pan, and allow to cook for 3 minutes, basting with fat in the pan. Remove the duck from the pan and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Drain some of the excess fat from the pan, then add the shallot. Cook over medium heat until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the cherries, capers and brandy, and flame the pan to cook off the liquid. Reduce to a glaze. Add the chicken stock and reduce until thick. Season with the red wine vinegar.

Slowly whisk in the milk, 2 tablespoons warm water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper until smooth. Refrigerate the batter, covered, at least 1 hour or overnight. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, and brush with melted butter. Whisk the 2 tablespoons of melted butter into the crepe batter (batter will appear a bit grainy, but that&#39;s OK). Ladle a scant 1/4 cup batter into the skillet, and swirl the batter around to cover the bottom. Cook the crepe over medium heat until the top appears dry and the edge is starting to curl back, about 30 seconds. Flip the crepe with your fingers or a spatula, and cook until brown in spots, about 15 seconds. Transfer the crepe to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with the remaining batter, for a total of 12 crepes (you can stack them on the rack once they&#39;ve cooled). (The crepes can be refrigerated, wrapped, overnight.) For the cream cheese spread: Combine the cream cheese, capers, cornichons, dill, lemon juice and zest, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl with a spatula. Drizzle in the heavy cream, and mix until smooth; set aside at room temperature. To assemble: Line an 8-inch round cake pan with plastic wrap so it overhangs by 4 inches on both sides. Place 1 crepe (this will be the top of the cake, so pick a pretty one) on a work surface, and spread evenly with 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese spread. Transfer the crepe, cheese-side up, to the cake pan. Arrange pieces of gravlax evenly over the cheese spread, sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice, then scatter with 1 tablespoon of the onion, followed by a generous tablespoon of the egg. Repeat 6 times. Spread the 8th crepe with 2 tablespoons of the cheese spread, then place it on top of the other layers, cheese-side down, to create the bottom of the cake. Stretch the plastic wrap over the cake to draw the lacy edges of the crepes up a bit and to cover the cake completely. Use a small cast-iron skillet or a large glass measuring cup to weigh down the cake and press it into an even shape. Refrigerate at least 1 hour up to overnight. To garnish: Remove the weight from the cake, and peel back the plastic. Use the long sides of the plastic to ease the cake out of the pan. Flip the cake pan over, and set the crepe cake on top. Place a serving plate over the cake, and invert the cake onto it. Remove the plastic. Whip the cream in a medium bowl with a hand mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Use an offset spatula to spread the whipped cream decoratively over the top of the crepe cake. Toss the dill, capers, cornichons and lemon zest in a small bowl until lightly combined, scatter the mixture over the whipped cream and sprinkle with salt and a few grinds of pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 49518,&quot;Ming&#39;s Breakfast Soy-Banana Shake 4 cups skim milk 2 bananas, peeled 2 scoops Spiru-tein Vanilla (Soy Protein Powder with Spirulina) or any equivalent powder 5 small pieces of ice Instructions: In a blender, add milk and bananas and top with powder and ice. On low speed, blend mix until very smooth. Serve in tall glasses. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49519,&quot;Basil Oil (and Other Herb Flavored Oils) Use 1 cup packed leaves to 2 cups pure olive oil. Use 4 cups packed leaves to 2 cups pure olive oil. Instructions: In a blender, puree the herbs and oil until completely smooth. Put the mixture in a saucepan and bring it to a simmer over moderate heat. Simmer for 45 seconds, then pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Don&#39;t press on the mixture, but you can tap the strainer against your hand to get the oil to drip through faster. Immediately strain the oil again through a flat-bottomed paper filter. If the filter clogs, you may need to change the filter partway through.<br> It&#39;s okay to pick the filter up and squeeze it gently to get the oil out faster, but be careful not to break the filter. Sometimes a little dark liquid comes through the filter first. Don&#39;t worry; that&#39;s water. It will settle to the bottom because it is heavier than the oil. Let the filtered oil settle for a few hours, then pour it off the dark liquid. Store in an airtight jar in a cool, dark place. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 49520,&quot;Pink&#39;s Bacon Burrito Dog 1 (12-inch) flour tortilla 2 steamed, premium all-beef hot dogs 2 slices American cheese 1/3 cup chili 3 slices crispy bacon 2 tablespoons diced onions Instructions: On a flour tortilla, place all ingredients, in the order listed.

Stir together the sugar and 1 cup of rum in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Put the pineapple slices in a medium bowl and pour the rum syrup over top. Let sit until the pineapple takes on the rum flavor, about 30 minutes.<br> For the cake: Meanwhile, generously coat a 12-cup Bundt pan with cooking spray. Whisk the cake mix with the oil, eggs, 1/2 cup water and remaining 1/2 cup rum until smooth. Remove the pineapples from the syrup, reserve the syrup.<br> Line the bottom and center cone and sides of the Bundt pan with whole pineapple slices (about 13 slices). Cut the remaining 3 slices in half and place them around the empty space at the top so the entire Bundt is lined. Put a cherry in the center of each whole pineapple slice. Pour the batter on top of the pineapples. Bake until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when touched, about 45 to 50 minutes.<br> Immediately place a heat proof serving platter on top of the Bundt pan and flip the pan over (use oven mitts to help you). Remove the pan from the cake and let cool completely, about 1 hour.<br> For the filling: Meanwhile, Prepare the pudding according to the package directions. Add the coconut extract. Spoon the pudding into a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. Press the tip into the side of the cake and squeeze in some pudding. Rotate and repeat around the cake. Then pipe any leftover pudding into the middle of the cake, going through the inside of the cake. Brush the entire cake with the reserved rum syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 49525,&quot;Pork Rind Cheese Puffs 1/3 cup cheddar cheese powder 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> Kosher salt 1/3 cup cheddar cheese powder 1 teaspoon chipotle powder<br> Zest of 2 limes<br> Kosher salt 10 ounces pork rinds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the cheddar ranch: Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl using a whisk. Set aside. For the chipotle cheddar: Place the cheddar powder, chipotle powder, zest and kosher salt into a spice grinder and pulse 2 or 3 times. Don&#39;t over pulse or the moisture from the zest will cause the cheese powder to clump up. (If you don&#39;t have a spice grinder, just whisk well.) Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. Spread out the pork rinds on a baking sheet. Bake until just hot, about 5 minutes; just enough to get the natural oils working so that the coating sticks more effectively. Remove the pork rinds from the oven and immediately add half of them to the bowl with the cheddar ranch mixture and half to the bowl with the chipotle cheddar. Toss quickly and thoroughly, coating the pork rinds in the cheesy mixtures and sprinkling any leftover coating on at the end. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, GSM]&quot; 49526,&quot;Spicy Avocado Dill Dip 1 medium ripe avocado 1 cup sour cream 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped, plus a few sprigs for garnish 2 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 medium jalapeno, minced, seeded for milder heat 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper Chips, or vegetable crudites, for serving Instructions: Mash the avocado with a fork in a medium bowl.

Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. For recipes that call for eggs that are raw or undercooked when the dish is served use shell eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 49532,&quot;White Vanilla Bean Cake with Balsamic Strawberry and Mascarpone Filling Nonstick spray 5 cups all-purpose flour<br> 4 cups cake flour<br> 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 2 teaspoons fine salt<br> 16 large egg whites, lightly beaten 4 cups sour cream<br> 2 cups milk<br> 6 tablespoons clear vanilla extract Seeds from 2 vanilla beans<br> 1 pound unsalted butter, softened<br> 5 1/3 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 pound fresh strawberries 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice 1 cup mascarpone cheese, room temperature<br> 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 tablespoon clear vanilla extract 1 pound unsalted butter, softened 2 cups shortening<br> 2 pounds confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 4 teaspoons clear vanilla extract<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Remove half of the batter to a medium bowl and set aside. Divide the other half of the batter equally between the three prepared baking pans. With the reserved half of batter, remove half into a separate bowl. Into one bowl, add 1 tablespoon of powdered, freeze-dried raspberries and stir to combine. Into the other bowl, add 1 tablespoon of powdered, freeze-dried blueberries and stir to combine. (For deeper colors, you can add a drop of pink and purple food coloring, respectively, as desired.) Dollop each of the raspberry and blueberry batters into all 3 cake pans. Using a butter knife or small offset spatula, swirl the dollops into the batter to create a tie-dyed or marbled effect. Gently tap the cake pans on the counter once or twice to eliminate any big air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs, begin checking for doneness at 22 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes in the pans, loosen the edges with a butter knife or offset spatula if needed, and turn onto a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Combine the powdered sugar, butter and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low until you\\u2019re confident that the powdered sugar won\\u2019t fly everywhere, then increase the speed to medium and continue to mix until smooth. Add the heavy cream, vanilla and almond extract, increase the speed to medium-high and continue to mix for a few more seconds, until combined and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Remove two-thirds of the frosting into a bowl and mix in 1 tablespoon each of freeze-dried raspberries and blueberries and a few drops of lavender food coloring until you reach the desired color. Set aside. Into the remaining frosting, add drops of pink food coloring until you reach the desired color. Add the pink frosting to a large piping bag fitted with the #124 petal tip. To assemble and decorate: Level the tops of the cakes with a serrated knife.

Using the point of a chef&#39;s knife and a back and forth sawing motion, cut into the crust following an outline 1/2 inch larger than the cheese on all sides; be careful not to cut all the way through to the bottom of the bread. Remove the cut crust and some of the loaf&#39;s interior, leaving the bottom crust and the bread on the sides intact (set aside the extra bread for breadcrumbs or another use). The cheese should fit in the cavity with about a 1/2-inch space around it and it should be about flush with the top of the bread. If not, cut and trim the cheese so it fits.<br> Line the bread bowl with the prosciutto so that the meat completely covers the bottom and sides (this will stop the melted cheese from leaking as it bakes). Drape the cured meats along the sides of the cutout so that they hang over the edges of the loaf.<br> Sprinkle half of the giardiniera and olives over the prosciutto. Top with the cheese blocks. Sprinkle the remaining giardiniera and olives over the top and sides of the cheese. Brush any exposed bread with oil. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, cover with foil and bake until the cheese is completely melted and beginning to drip down the sides, 45 to 50 minutes. Let sit covered for 10 minutes before cutting into thick slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 49557,&quot;Sausage and Savory Herb Quiche 1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust 3/4 cup baby spinach<br> 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped (about 1/2 bunch) 2 fresh sage leaves<br> 1 sprig fresh mint, leaves only<br> 1 sprig fresh marjoram, leaves only<br> Kosher salt<br> 6 large eggs<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 1 1/2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese<br> 1/2 cup crumbled cooked Italian sausage<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Stir in the olive oil, and then the bread. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put the salmon, skin side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Spoon the bread mixture onto the salmon and smooth with a spatula to cover completely. Put the baking sheet into the oven and roast until the salmon is just cooked through but still translucent in the center, about 10 minutes. When the salmon is cooked, take it out of the oven and set aside. Combine the mayonnaise, the chopped arugula, and the lemon juice in a blender and puree. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, transfer the salmon to a serving platter by holding 2 opposing corners of the parchment paper and lifting the whole thing off the baking sheet and onto the platter, parchment and all. Spoon the mayonnaise into a serving bowl and garnish with remaining arugula. If serving with cocktail bread set the salmon out with the arugula mayonnaise, and the arugula leaves and let guests make open-faced sandwiches by spreading the toast with the mayonnaise, adding a leaf or 2 of arugula, and finishing with a spoonful of the salmon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 49588,&quot;Sabrina Pizza 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast 5 1/2 cups \\00\\ pizza flour, such as Caputo 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 heaping tablespoon grated caciocavallo cheese 1 heaping tablespoon grated buffalo mozzarella 1 heaping tablespoon grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 heaping tablespoon grated stracchino cheese, such as Belgioioso crescenza 3 tablespoons truffle cream, such as Urbani 5 slices imported Italian salami, such as Golfetta 1 tablespoon shaved fresh black truffle Instructions: For the dough: Combine the sugar, oil, yeast and 2 cups cold water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let the mixture sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. With the motor running, slowly add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture. Keep mixing until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Divide the dough into a ball. Transfer the ball to a lightly greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish and brush with oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Remove the dough 3 hours prior to the next steps. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. For the toppings: Add the cheeses to a blender and process to combine. Set aside the cheese blend in a bowl. Start to stretch the dough creating the desired base for the pizza. Once the dough is the desired shape and size, top with the truffle cream. Next, sprinkle the four-cheese blend in 8 evenly spaced spots. Then lay the salami on top. Place the pizza in the oven until the cheese melts and the crust is puffed and charred in spots, 7 to 8 minutes. Once the pizza is finished, remove from the oven and top with the fresh black truffle. Now you can enjoy your amazing pizza with a nice glass of wine. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 49589,&quot;Apple Ribbon Pie 2 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 6 ounces cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/4 cup ice water (strain out the ice just before using) 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar 1/2 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 5 Granny Smith apples, peeled 1 1/2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces Instructions: Make the Crust: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. (You should still be able to see the pieces of butter.)<br> In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together.<br> With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. (You should still see small bits of butter.) Transfer the dough to a work surface and shape into a round, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.)<br> When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature to make it more workable. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on forming a good circle from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm up the butter. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 12 inches wide for a 10-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.<br> Set your pie pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. To transfer the crust to the pan, I find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.<br> Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; we&#39;ll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. To decorate the rim, fold under the excess dough then just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \\V\\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill it while you prep the filling.<br> Make the Filling: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> In a medium bowl, toss the sugar, salt, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg together. Sprinkle half the sugar mixture on the bottom of the pie shell.<br> Using a Japanese-style turning vegetable slicer, cut the apples into 1-inch wide, long strips. Make apple strips into S-curves (like ribbon candy) and tuck them into the crust next to each other tightly to fill the pie shell. Sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over the ribbons and dot with the butter. Place the pie on a sheet pan to catch any juices that boil over. Bake in the center of the oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F. and bake until the crust is golden brown about 40 to 50 minutes more. Check the pie after 30 minutes; if the crust&#39;s edge is browning too quickly, cover it lightly with a strip of foil. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49590,&quot;California Wrap Sandwich Four 10-inch flour tortillas 8 to 12 trimmed leaves of green or red leaf lettuce, washed and dried 12 ounces sliced cooked turkey breast 12 slices apple-wood smoked bacon, cooked 1 vine-ripened tomato, cored and cut into 16 wedges 1 ripe Hass avocado, peeled, pitted and cut into 16 slices tossed with 2 teaspoons lime juice Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup arugula or watercress, washed and dried 1/2 recipe Ranch dressing, recipe follows 2 cloves garlic 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup prepared or homemade mayonnaise 1/4 to 1/3 cup buttermilk 2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives 1 scallion, thinly sliced 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Wrap tortillas in barely damp, doubled layers of paper towels and microwave on high for 45 to 60 seconds. Alternatively, heat the tortillas individually in an un-greased large skillet over medium heat.<br> Lay the tortillas on a cutting board and start to layer the ingredients. Fan the leaf lettuce on the top three-quarters of each tortilla then lay the turkey slices on top, followed by the bacon, tomato, and avocado. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Top with the arugula and some of the dressing. Fold up the bottom quarter of the tortilla and then start to roll each sandwich into a cone shape. Secure the tortilla with a toothpick. Serve immediately. Mash the garlic and salt to a paste with the side of a chef&#39;s knife. In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, mayonnaise, 1/4-cup buttermilk, parsley, chives, scallion, vinegar, and pepper to taste. If the sauce is very thick, thin the dressing with a couple more tablespoons of the buttermilk. Use immediately or refrigerate, covered, for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 49591,&quot;Pierogi Casserole 1 large egg 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the baking dish 3/4 cup sour cream, plus more for serving 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish, optional 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste 1 cup heavy cream, heated until hot 8 tablespoons cold butter, cubed 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pound bacon, chopped 2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced 1 1/2 cups shredded Gruyere 1 1/2 cups shredded farmer&#39;s cheese Instructions: For the pierogi dough: Combine the egg, butter, sour cream, chives and salt with your hands in a bowl. Don&#39;t worry if the mixture is not uniform and, as with pie dough, don&#39;t overwork it. Add the flour and mix with your hands until a dough forms. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate the dough at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. For the filling: Put the potatoes in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of cold water. Bring to a boil. Season the water generously with salt. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until a knife easily pierces the potatoes. Drain and return the potatoes to the pot. Mash, slowly mixing in the hot cream and cold butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.<br> Warm the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions and toss to coat with the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are caramelized and sweet. Let cool.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish or metal pan.<br> Roll out the pierogi dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface to a 1/8-inch-thick rectangle. Cut into 4-by-13-inch strips, re-rolling the scraps as necessary. You will need 14 to 20 strips.<br> To assemble: Have the mashed potatoes, crisp bacon, caramelized onions, pasta strips and cheeses ready on a work surface. Arrange one layer of pierogi dough strips on the bottom of the buttered casserole dish, slightly overlapping the edges of the strips. Spread a 1/2-inch layer of potatoes on top of the dough. Top with some caramelized onions, bacon and a sprinkling of both Gruyere and farmer&#39;s cheese. Repeat the layers to use the remaining ingredients, finishing with the dough, followed by some Gruyere and farmer&#39;s cheese. Season the top with pepper.<br> Bake until the casserole is bubbly and the cheese on top is golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Grease a 9 1/2 by 13 1/2 by 3/4-inch pan. Cut waxed paper width of pan plus 5 inches in length. Line the pan so there is at least 2 inches of waxed paper extending over both ends of the pan. Grease the paper. Separate the eggs, and beat the yolks with the sugar, until they are light, creamy and thickened. Break chocolate into pieces and place in medium saucepan with the water. Melt over hot (not boiling) and let cool. Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites until stiff. Stir the chocolate into the yolks and fold in the beaten egg whites. Gently combine. To facilitate this, put a small amount of whites into the yolk and chocolate mixture and then add all this back into the whites. Spread the chocolate mixture evenly in the prepared pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Shut off the oven and bake 5 minutes more. Practice will tell you if the timing is right. Remove from the oven and cover top with a dishtowel wrung out in cold water. Stretch the cloth tight and tuck under the pan. Cool, and refrigerate 1 hour. Remove the cloth carefully and loosen edges with knife. Dust top heavily and completely with cocoa. Lay 2 pieces of waxed paper longer than the pan side by side overlapping with the top over the bottom. Turn out cake on bottom end of paper and carefully pull off the waxed paper. Whip the cream over a bowl of ice, and add the sugar and vanilla when it begins to thicken. Beat until stiff. Spread the cake with the whipped cream, with less towards the top. Roll the cake from bottom, the long side forward, using the waxed paper to roll it. When rolled, the paper should be all around it so you can mold it with your hands as you finish. Put on a long wooden board to chill for a few hours. When ready to serve, open the paper and cut off along side with the tip of a knife. If there are cracks along the side, dust all over with the cocoa in a shaker or use a small sieve or sifter to distribute it where needed. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 49593,&quot;Perfect Roast Chicken 1 (5 to 6 pound) roasting chicken Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 large bunch fresh thyme, plus 20 sprigs 1 lemon, halved 1 head garlic, cut in half crosswise 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter, melted 1 large yellow onion, thickly sliced 4 carrots cut into 2-inch chunks 1 bulb of fennel, tops removed, and cut into wedges Olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil. Put on a baking sheet and bake until just cooked through, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly, then shred the meat with 2 forks. Roast the bell peppers and chiles directly on a gas burner (or directly under the broiler) until the skin is mostly black. Throw the peppers and chiles into a plastic storage bag and seal it. Let them steam inside the bag for 30 minutes or so. Core and seed, then scrape off the black skin. Chop and set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the chopped onions and jalapeno in the vegetable oil until the onions are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Throw in the shredded chicken, then stir in 1 cup of the chicken broth and 1 cup of the heavy cream. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the paprika and some salt and pepper, then add half of the chopped roasted peppers and chiles. Stir the mixture around and let it cook for a couple of minutes, then set it aside. In a separate skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk it together to combine. Cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute. Then pour in the remaining 2 cups chicken broth, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Then add the remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon paprika and 1 1/2 cups of the grated cheese. Finally, stir in the sour cream and the rest of the chopped roasted peppers and chiles. If the sauce needs a little thinning, splash in as much broth as you need. Give the sauce a taste and add salt if it needs it (with all the cheese, it shouldn&#39;t need much). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the tortillas in paper towels and microwave until very soft and pliable, about a minute. Place a small amount of the chicken mixture and about a tablespoon of the grated cheese down the center of each tortilla. Fold over the edges and arrange them seam-side down in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Pour the sauce over the top. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1 cup grated cheese and bake until bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.

Stir together the confectioners&#39; sugar and almond flour and sift it through a tammie or very open mesh strainer. In a mixer with a whip attachment, whip the whites until frothy. Add the sugar (and food coloring if using) and whip until stiff. Add 1/3 of the almond mixture and fold part way in. Add another 1/3 and fold partway in. Add final 1/3 and fold in leaving a few specks of egg whites. It will look like deflated marshmallow. Place a pastry bag with a close pin holding it shut in a tall round container folding the edge over the rim of the container to fill it easily. Pipe dots of meringue at each corner to stick down some parchment paper on a sheet pan. Pipe rows of kisses 1-inch each (size of a quarter) one half inch apart. Bake about 17 minutes until very light brown. Pour 1/4 cup water under the parchment paper at both ends of the sheet to steam them loose. Let cool and peel off. Easy Buttercream: In a mixer with a whip attachment whip the butter very well, scraping the bowl often until it&#39;s light and fluffy. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix on low. Drizzle in the flavorings with the hot water. Chill up to a week until ready to use, then bring to room temperature. Pipe macaroons with buttercream and make little sandwiches.

Add the pasta, and boil according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil. Meanwhile, arrange the shrimp in a single layer on a large pie pan or paper plate, and pat them with a paper towel until completely dry. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high, and invert the plate of shrimp over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, until the underside is pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the shrimp, and cook until fully pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce warm. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the shrimp and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 49603,&quot;New England Boiled Dinner 1 corned beef brisket (4 to 5 pounds) 4 quarts chicken broth 1 teaspoon pickling spices 1 head garlic, unpeeled and cut into quarters 12 small new potatoes, peeled 6 carrots, coarsely chopped 6 small turnips, diced 8 small beets, with tops Hot mustard (optional) Prepared horseradish (optional) Instructions: Place the corned beef and broth in a Dutch oven.

Add the chicken breasts and bay leaf, and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook the chicken, partially covered, until cooked through, about 35 minutes. (To check for doneness, slit the chicken in half to make sure the interior is no longer pink.) Remove the chicken (reserve the broth) and allow to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, shred by hand and place in a medium bowl. Remove enough broth to leave about 2 cups in the pan with the onions and garlic (cool and refrigerate or freeze the extra broth for another use). Remove the bay leaf. Add the tomatillos and jalapenos and cook until the tomatillos are olive green, 10 to 12 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the solid ingredients (onions, tomatillos and garlic) to a blender. Add the cilantro and process until smooth (using some of the liquid in the pan if needed). Season with salt and pepper. Pour the salsa back into the saucepan and bring to a boil; add the chicken and cook until the flavors incorporate, about 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. To assemble the empanadas: Dust a flat surface with flour. Roll out the pizza dough about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Using a 6-inch round cookie cutter (or a bowl or plate with the same diameter), cut the dough into circles. Expect to get about 3 circles from 1 pound of dough. Brush the egg wash over the surface of one dough round. Add 2 tablespoons of filling onto half of the circle and sprinkle about 1 ounce of mozzarella on top of the filling, if using. Fold the plain half over the filling. Seal the edges with fork tines or crimp decoratively. Repeat for the remaining empanadas. (Save any leftover filling in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week for another use.) Transfer the empanadas to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of the empanadas with the egg wash. Bake until crisp and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 49646,&quot;Veggie Lasagna Rollups 1 pound lasagna noodles Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying baking sheet 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 medium onion, diced 1 red bell pepper, diced<br> 24 ounces white mushrooms, chopped<br> 2 yellow squash, diced<br> 2 zucchini, diced<br> 1/2 cup white wine<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper One 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained<br> 1/4 cup tomato paste<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> 32 ounces ricotta 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 2 large eggs<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds shredded fresh mozzarella<br> Grated Parmesan, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: For the noodles: Cook the noodles according to the package instructions.

In a large saute pan, add the pork and beef with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper, and saute until no longer pink, about 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a deep, rectangular lasagna pan, add a thin layer of sauce to the bottom, then layer the lasagna strips evenly across the bottom of the pan to cover the entire surface, about 8 sheets of pasta. Sprinkle 1/4 of the cooked meat mixture over this, then lay out 8 slices of mortadella on top. Sprinkle 1/4 of the cubed mozzarella and 1/4 of the grated cheeses and top with a layer of tomato sauce. Repeat with another layer of 8 lasagna sheets to cover, then do a layer of prosciutto, mozzarella, another 1/4 of the grated cheese, 1/3 of the chopped herbs, another 1/4 of the cooked meat, and tomato sauce. Finish this layer with 1/2 of the chopped hard-boiled eggs. Repeat with another layer of lasagna, remaining prosciutto and mortadella, another 1/4 of the grated cheeses, another 1/3 of the chopped herbs, remaining chopped eggs, another 1/4 of the mozzarella, another 1/4 of the cooked meat, and sauce. Repeat with the last layer of lasagna, remaining cooked meat, remaining grated cheeses, remaining mozzarella, and a thin layer of tomato sauce. Sprinkle the top layer with the remaining chopped parsley and basil and fresh cracked black pepper. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for about 1/2 hour, until cheeses melt and ingredients have melded. Try not to let the aluminum foil touch the top layer or the cheese will stick when you uncover. Uncover and let cool and set for about 1/2 hour before cutting so lasagna can absorb the liquid released by the cheeses. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 49671,&quot;Lasagna One 32-ounce can pureed tomatoes 2 teaspoons oregano, dried 2 teaspoons basil, dried 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 garlic cloves, minced 2/3 cup red wine 1 cup water 2 large eggs, beaten 1 1/2 pints ricotta cheese 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese 1 pound dry lasagna 1 pound mozzarella, grated Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. For the filling: Whisk together the brown sugar, flour, apple cider, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a large bowl. Peel and core the apples and cut into chunks. Add the apples to the brown sugar mixture and toss to combine. Transfer the apple mixture to the prepared baking dish in an even layer. For the topping: Combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, pecans, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Add the butter cubes and use your fingers to completely work the butter into the flour mixture. The mixture should hold its shape when squeezed. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the filling, squeezing some of the mixture into small clumps. Bake until the filling is bubbly, the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown, about 1 hour.

Pulse several times until the fat is evenly distributed throughout the flour and no particles of fat are visible. Dissolve the salt in 2/3 cup of the warm water. With the machine running, pour the liquid through the feed tube in a steady stream and stop the machine once the dough has come together in a ball. Feel the dough, it should be a medium-stiff consistency, not too firm but not as soft as most bread doughs. If the dough is too stiff, divide it into several pieces, sprinkle with 1 or 2 tablespoons of the remaining water and process again until a ball forms. Divide the dough into 12 portions, roll into balls and place on a flat surface or plate. Cover with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for at least 30 minutes. On a lightly floured surface roll each ball into a 7-inch circle by flattening the ball of dough, lightly flouring it, and with a rolling pin rolling forward and backward over the dough, then turn it a sixth of a turn and roll forward and backward agaiy &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 49674,&quot;Black Bean Hummus 1 cup cooked black beans 1 garlic clove, minced 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, cut into wedges Instructions: Blend all the ingredients, except the lettuce, in a food processor until almost smooth.

In a small bowl, combine Cajun seasoning, paprika, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper, to taste. Sprinkle the spice mixture over the shrimp to coat well and set the shrimp aside. Next, make your grits. In a medium saucepan, bring water, chicken bouillon cubes and 2 tablespoons butter to a boil. Slowly add the grits, whisking often with wire whisk for 5 minutes. Add tomato paste, cream, and cheese. Keep whisking for another 2 or 3 minutes until the grits become creamy. Don&#39;t skimp on the butter and the cream, folks. Now saute the shrimp. In a large saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add minced garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Add in the spice-coated shrimp, and cook only until they&#39;re just done and tender. Don&#39;t overcook. Remove the shrimp from the saute pan and set them aside in a bowl. You can taste 1 or 2, to see if they&#39;re okay. The roux is next. With all those wonderful drippings from the shrimp in the saute pan, add 3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and stir with a wooden spatula to make a roux. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until roux reaches a medium-tan color, then slowly add the chicken stock and heavy whipping cream. Whisk together and cook for 2 minutes, then whisk in Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Set aside. And last, a little country ham. Cook 1 center slice of cured country ham in a saute pan, and cut into cubes. To serve, and this is the best part-place a few heaping spoonfuls of steaming cheese grits onto a place, top with several sizzling shrimp. Drizzle that wonderful roux sauce over top of the shrimp, and sprinkle on a few cubes of country ham.

Fill rice cooker or casserole with water to about 1-inch over rice or use Mt Fuji method. I highly recommend a rice cooker - more than 2 billion people use them in Asia for a reason. Slowly heat vinegar, mirin and sugar until very hot but not boiling. Fold in &#39;su&#39; (vinegar and sugar) with the hot rice, add enough so that the rice has a tart/sweet taste. Rice should be shiny, not mushy.

Place the remaining sugar in a large saute pan over high heat and cook, without stirring, until the sugar starts to caramelize and turns golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes (it happens fast, so don&#39;t leave the stove). Add the apples and toss to coat with the sugar. Remove the pan from the heat, add the bourbon, and then place it back over the heat. (The bourbon can flame up, so be very careful.) Bring the bourbon to a boil, add the butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves, and cook over high heat until the apples are tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let cool until tepid. Add the candied ginger and mix well. To prepare the egg rolls, place 1 lumpia wrapper on a flat surface, with a corner pointing toward you (as you look down on it, the wrapper should be a diamond shape). Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling on the wrapper about 1/2-inch from the corner closest to you, and then fold the corner over the filling. Fold the side corners over the filling, then roll to the opposite corner to form a cylinder. Brush the edge of the wrapper with the beaten egg to seal. Continue with the remaining wrappers and filling. Heat about 4 inches of vegetable oil in a large saucepan over high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F. (You can check the temperature with a candy thermometer, or place a piece of bread in the oil; if it turns brown in about 40 seconds the oil should be at about 350 degrees F) Add as many egg rolls as will fit without overcrowding, and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Let cool for 3 to 4 minutes, then dust with powdered sugar. Continue with the remaining egg rolls. Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 49682,&quot;Turkey and Vegetable Chow Fun Kosher salt 12 ounces wide rice noodles, pappardelle or fettuccine 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 1/4 cup oyster sauce 2 tablespoons rice vinegar (not seasoned) 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 small Japanese eggplant, sliced into rounds 4 ounces mixed mushrooms, cut into pieces (about 1 cup) 2 cloves garlic, chopped 3/4 pound ground turkey 1 bunch scallions, sliced 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped Sriracha or other Asian cl sauce, for serving (optional) Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil; add the noodles and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1 1/4 cups of the cooking water, then drain and rinse the noodles. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Mix the oyster sauce and vinegar in a cup; set aside.

Sprinkle the yeast over the surface over the liquid and set aside without stirring until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk flour, cornmeal, and salt in a large bowl, make a well in the center, and add yeast mixture. With a wooden spoon or your hand, gradually stir flour into liquid to make a rough dough. Pull dough together into a ball. Turn onto a work surface dusted with flour. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 to 6 minutes, using a little flour if necessary to keep it from sticking. Shape dough into a ball. Brush a large bowl with oil and turn dough around in bowl to coat lightly. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic, and note the time -- let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Turn dough onto a work surface; knead briefly to release excess air, re-shape into a ball and return to the bowl. Cover, and let rise until soft and puffy, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile prepare your topping: Grate the tomatoes on the large holes of a box grater into a large bowl. If very juicy, drain lightly in a strainer. Sprinkle the garlic with the salt and mash and smear the garlic into a paste with the side of a chef&#39;s knife. Add to the drained tomatoes. Whisk in the olive oil and season with the salt and pepper to taste. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Divide dough in half. Form dough into rounds (see How-to pictures). Press dough into cornmeal, flipping to dust both sides. Hold dough up like a steering wheel and rotate and stretch it to make a thin disk. Lightly brush a pizza screen or crisper with oil and place round on top. Spread half the tomato over the top and bake until crust is golden and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza from the oven and drop spoonfuls of ricotta on top. Scatter the fresh herbs and serve. Repeat with remaining pizza. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 49685,&quot;Individual Strawberry Trifles 1 quart fresh strawberries, halved 1/3 cup aged balsamic vinegar 3 cups heavy cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 (1 pound) fresh pound cake 1/3 cup amaretto liqueur 2 amaretto cookies, for garnish Mint, for garnish Instructions: In a small shallow casserole dish, toss the strawberries with vinegar and let stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. After the strawberries have marinated, check for sweetness, adding sugar if desired. In a large bowl using an electric mixer, whisk the cream to soft peaks. Add the vanilla and confectioners&#39; sugar. Whip until stiff peaks. Set aside. Using a serrated knife, slice pound cake lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices. You will only need 2 slices. Using a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out 2 circles from each cake slice. Line up 2 high ball glasses (about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter and 4 1/2 to 5 inches high) and place 1 cake circle in the bottom of each. Brush cakes with amaretto liqueur. Add 2 tablespoons of marinated strawberries and spread evenly. Using a different tablespoon, add a large dollop of whipped cream and spread evenly. Add a second layer of cake, pressing down lightly.

On one half, evenly layer on the ham, then the mortadella, salami and provolone. Top with the romaine, radicchio and tomatoes, then top with the other half of the loaf. Cut into 1-inch sandwiches and serve with Quick-Pickled Zucchini on the side. Put the red peppers, mayonnaise, vinegar, oregano, red cl flakes and garlic in a food processor and pulse to combine well. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar, salt, mustard seeds, cl flakes and 3 cups water to a simmer. Cook until the salt has dissolved, about 5 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper, add the corn starch and lemon juice and pulse to combine-- I like my fillings to have a little texture. (Alternatively chop the shrimp and scallops finely then add the pork, ginger, cilantro and vinegar and chop together. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and rapidly mix in the vinegar, sesame oil, egg whites, seasoning, corn starch and lemon juice.) To make the shumai: Hold a wonton wrapper in your hand. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of the wrapper (rinse the spoon in cold water so the filling doesn&#39;t stick). Gather the edges of the wrapper up around the filling and squeeze the sides together with your fingers forming a little pleated cup. (The sides will naturally pleat, leaving the filling slightly exposed.) Tap the dumpling on the table so the bottom is flat and it stands upright then set aside on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Top each shumai with a pea. (You can freeze any leftover filling.) Lightly oil the bottom of a bamboo steamer then line it with the cabbage leaves. Stand the dumplings in the steamer in a single layer taking care that they don&#39;t touch one another. (A 10-inch steamer will accommodate 12 shumai). Bring about 2 inches of water to a boil in a wok. Set the bamboo steamer in the wok, cover it with the bamboo lid and steam until the shumai feel firm, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve the shumai immediately garnished with green onions and accompanied by soy sauce or dipping sauces of your choice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 49696,&quot;Lobster Tail 1/2 cup water 21-ounce lobster tail Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3.15 ounces hot clarified butter Instructions: Heat frying pan and add 1/2 cup of water.

Roll the pastry out on a floured counter to a rectangle of about 19 x 12 1/2in (48 by 32cm) and bash the pastry with the rolling pin a bit. Puff pastry is made of fine layers and normally you have to be very delicate with it. For sausage rolls the pastry needs to be slightly puffed but not too much, so bashing it with a rolling pin reduces the amount it puffs up. Cut the large rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut both smaller rectangles into eight equal sections. You now have 16 rectangles in total. Brush one end of each rectangle with a little of the beaten egg and lay a piece of sausage at the other end, then season the sausage with salt and pepper and sprinkle with thyme leaves. Roll the sausage up in the pastry to enclose and repeat with all the sausages. For a flavor variation add sage, parsley, or chopped rosemary. Put the sausage rolls in the refrigerator for 20 minutes for the pastry to harden. Once the pastry is hard, remove them from the refrigerator and score the tops with a sharp knife for decoration or prick with a fork. Brush well all over with the rest of the beaten egg and bake in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry has turned a golden brown and looks crisp.

Press one half of the mixture into the bottom and sides of an ungreased 10-inch glass or ceramic pie plate, building up the sides to the top of the plate to form an edge. Reserve remaining mixture for the topping. To make the lime curd, combine the butter, lime juice, cornmeal, salt and 3/4 cup of the sugar in a large bowl over a pan of simmering water with the bottom not touching the water, and slowly cook, scraping the sides of the bowl and whisking occasionally, another 15 minutes, or until thickened. Cover with plastic and refrigerate. Stir the curd every 10 minutes or so to cool evenly. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar until stiff and glossy. Gently fold half of the beaten whites into the cool lime curd to lighten. Then fold in the remaining whites and the lime zest. (This should be very gentle; it is okay for a few streaks of white to be showing.) Pour the filling into the pie shell and sprinkle on reserved topping evenly to cover. Gently press the sides in so the top 1/2 inch of the crust remains bare. Bake 45 minutes, or until the pie has risen and coconut is golden brown. The filling should be slightly cracked and firm when pressed in the center. Cool completely, cover with plastic and refrigerate 6 hours to chill thoroughly.

Then, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy small skillet over high heat. Rub the frozen beef with salt and pepper. Add the beef to the hot skillet and sear on all sides, about 4 minutes total (the beef will be just barely seared on the outside but will remain rare). Freeze the beef until it is almost frozen, about 1 hour (this makes it easier to cut into very thin slices). Using a large sharp carving knife, slice the beef as thinly as possible. Arrange the arugula and Parmesan shavings on a serving platter and lay the beef slices on top. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and lemon juice. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve. Alternative: Use 6 ounces of thinly-sliced bresaola instead of the tenderloin. Do not cook the bresaola. Serve it as you would the tenderloin, above. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 49747,&quot;One Recipe, Two Meals: Pizza Rolls for the Kids and a Dressed-Up Pie for You Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheet 2 pounds prepared pizza dough All-purpose flour, for rolling 1 cup prepared pizza sauce (more if you need it!) 1/2 cup chopped fresh baby spinach, plus another cup whole leaves 8 ounces shredded mozzarella 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil One 8-ounce package mixed gourmet mushrooms (the package I buy contains trumpet, brown clamshell and velvet pioppini, but any mushroom you want to use is fine) One 8-ounce package mixed gourmet mushrooms (the package I buy contains trumpet, brown clamshell and velvet pioppini, but any mushroom you want to use is fine)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 to 4 balls bocconcini (small fresh mozzarella balls) 2 slices prosciutto Small chunk Manchego cheese Basil leaves, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. If you have a pizza stone, put that in the oven, but leave a rack empty for baking the pizza rolls.<br> Roll out 1 pound of the pizza dough 1/8-inch thick on a floured work surface. Using a pizza cutter, trim the edges to make a 12-inch square. Starting about 1 inch from the bottom, spread the pizza sauce in a thin line, from the left side to the right. Top with a sprinkling of chopped spinach and a small sprinkling of shredded mozzarella cheese. Starting from the bottom, roll the dough over the filling, and then roll one more half turn. Using a pizza cutter, slice off the completed roll, forming a long tube shape. Then slice the tube into 1 1/2-inch pieces; pinch the cut ends to seal, forming little rolls.<br> Repeat the process with the remaining rolled out dough. You should be able to make about 22 rolls total. (You can freeze any leftover dough, or make some quick breadsticks.)<br> Place the rolls about 1 1/2-inches apart on the baking sheet and brush the tops with some of the egg wash. Bake until golden brown on top, 13 to 16 minutes. (And the cheese might be seeping out on the sides, which means you&#39;ve done something right in life.)<br> While the pizza rolls bake, heat the butter and oil and in a medium skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Cut the remaining pound of pizza dough in half, and roll out each piece on a floured worked surface to make two roughly 8-to-10-inch rounds. Put the rounds on baking sheets, or use a pizza peel to build 1 pizza at a time if you are using a pizza stone.<br> Divide and spread the remaining pizza sauce evenly over both crusts. Follow with an even scattering of mushrooms, the whole spinach leaves and the remaining shredded mozzarella. Tear the bocconcini into pieces and scatter them over the tops of the pizzas. Bake both pizzas on the baking sheet or 1 at a time on the stone, until the dough is cooked through and the cheese is browned and bubbly, 13 to 17 minutes.<br> Top the pizzas with some torn prosciutto and basil leaves and good shavings of Manchego. Serve and inhale. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 49748,&quot;Braised Lamb Shanks With Green Olives And Apricots 4 lamb shanks, about 8 ounces each Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 sprigs fresh thyme, plus 2 sprigs 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 1 lemon, zested in big strips 2 garlic cloves, halved 1/2 teaspoon whole cloves 2 cinnamon sticks, plus 2 sticks 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon sugar 1 bottle full-bodied red wine, such as Cabernet Sauvignon 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 cups lamb or chicken stock 1 cup pearl onions, peeled 3 carrots, coarsely chopped 12 large green Spanish olives 12 dried apricots Instructions: First off, you want to marinate the lamb shanks for a few hours to really penetrate the deep flavor; the wine also tenderizes the meat. Put the shanks in a large glass bowl and season with salt and pepper. Break up the thyme and rosemary with your hands to release the oils and toss them on top of the lamb. Add the lemon peel, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, peppercorns, bay leaves, and sugar. Pour in the bottle of wine, cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. Line a few layers of paper towels on the counter. Pull the lamb shanks out of the wine marinade (reserving it for later), and lay them out on the paper towels, cover with more paper towels and pat the meat dry really well. Put the flour in a large shallow platter and season it with a fair amount of salt and pepper. Dredge the lamb shanks in the seasoned flour; tapping off the excess. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and add the oil. Sear the lamb shanks, turning carefully with tongs, so all sides are a brown caramel color. Drizzle with a little more oil if needed. Do this in batches if the shanks are big and look crowded in the pot. Strain marinade reserving the wine. Add the wine, remaining 2 sticks of cinnamon, remaining 2 sprigs of thyme and the stuff from the marinade. Cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Pour in the stock and add the onions, carrots, olives, and apricots; bring to a boil. Cover the pot. Place in the oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Transfer the lamb shanks to a large platter. Spoon the onions, olives, and apricots over them. Strain the braising juices and season with salt and pepper.

Heat a large 6-quart pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Add the steak, steak bone, parsley stems, if using, carrots, celery and onion. Add 8 cups water. The water should cover the contents of the pot; add a small amount more if necessary. Bring up to a boil, and then reduce to simmer. Simmer uncovered for 1 hour 30 minutes, skimming and discarding any fat and scum that may accumulate on top. Strain the broth, reserving the meat. Discard the vegetables. To serve the broth on its own, ladle into a mug or serving bowl and add 2 to 3 tablespoons Chianti per serving and some salt and pepper. Serve hot. For the stew, reserve 2 cups of broth, or more as needed. For the beef stew: Place the potatoes in a 4-quart pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until the potatoes are cooked through, about 25 minutes. Test by piercing with a knife; the potatoes should have no resistance. Drain and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and sage and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and saute until soft, and then add the crushed tomatoes and cook until reduced and very thick, about 10 minutes. Dredge the boiled beef pieces (they should still be roughly in 1- to 2-inch pieces) very lightly in flour, shaking to remove all excess. Add to the sauce along with the cooked potatoes and 2 cups of the beef broth. Cover and cook for another 15 minutes to meld the flavors and thicken the sauce. The meat will shred a bit as you stir gently. If the stew becomes too dry at this point, add enough beef broth or water to reach the desired consistency, and bring up to a simmer. Season the stew with salt and pepper and serve warm with sliced bread. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 49777,&quot;Indian Summer Stew: Butternut Squash, Coconut, and Lentil Stew 1 cup yellow split pigeon peas (toor dal) 1 pound butternut squash, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 2 1/2 cups) 1 Roma tomato, diced 1/2 cup fresh, frozen, or dried shredded coconut 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 4 cups vegetable stock or water, or enough to cover 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 teaspoon brown or black mustard seeds 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 clove garlic, minced 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon honey 1 lime, juiced 1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Rinse the pigeon peas in a couple changes of water.

Add the mustard seeds and when they stop popping, add the red pepper flakes, garlic, and salt. Swirl the skillet so the contents cook evenly, and cook another 10 seconds. Then pour the contents of the skillet into the soup, along with the salt. Spoon a ladleful of soup back into the skillet (it will sizzle, be careful!), and pour back into the soup pot. Finish with the honey, lime juice, and cilantro.

Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with two 8-by-16-inch pieces of aluminum foil so the foil extends over all 4 sides. For the base: Pulse the flour, confectioners\\u2019 sugar, lemon zest and salt in a food processor to combine (about 4 long pulses). Scatter bits of the chilled coconut oil across the top and pulse about 10 times to distribute the oil; the mixture will be dry and sandy. Sprinkle the cashew milk over the top and pulse about 6 times to form a homogenous and sticky dough, like a soft sugar cookie dough.<br> Spoon chunks of the dough evenly across the prepared pan, then press it firmly but gently into the bottom, sides and corners, wetting your hands slightly with cool water to keep the dough from sticking to them. Poke 12 or so holes across the dough with a fork.<br> Bake until the edges of the dough are light golden brown and the top is dry, about 30 minutes. About halfway through, it may puff away from the pan in spots; poke those spots with a fork or carefully press back down with your hand. Continue to bake, checking once or twice more and repeating as needed. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and set aside.<br> For the topping: Whisk together the granulated sugar, cornstarch, flour, lemon zest and turmeric in a small saucepan. (The color won\\u2019t turn bright yellow right away, so don\\u2019t be tempted to add more turmeric.) Whisk in the cashew milk and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, about 5 to 6 minutes. Once it comes to a boil, continue to boil and whisk for 2 minutes more. The bubbles will get slower and pop bigger as the mixture thickens; you can reduce the heat to a strong simmer if you are concerned a bubble might burst and burn your hand.<br> Remove from the heat, add the coconut oil and whisk until melted and thoroughly incorporated. Scrape the mixture over the baked base and spread to the sides of the pan in an even layer. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover with foil and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours. When the bars are ready, lift the foil from the pan using the overhangs, then slide the base onto a cutting board. Let the bars come to room temperature, about 1 hour or more, depending on the temperature in your kitchen. Slice into sixteen 2-inch squares or thirty-two 1-by-2-inch bars (they are very rich, so you may prefer the smaller size). Dust the tops with confectioners\\u2019 sugar before serving (see Cook\\u2019s Note).

Strain the butter into a small bowl and immediately place it in the fridge to solidify, about 30 minutes. Scrape the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium-high speed until it is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar in batches. Beat in the heavy cream, salt and food coloring. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Build the cookies: Pipe buttercream on the bottoms of 9 cookies to cover in an even layer. Top each with another cookie, then chill until the buttercream is hardened, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line a plate with parchment paper. Melt the chocolate and vegetable oil together in a small saucepan over medium heat until smooth. Working with one cookie at a time, gently place in the chocolate and spoon more chocolate over the top until completely coated. Use a slotted spatula or spoon to remove the cookie from the chocolate and place on the lined plate. Repeat with the remaining cookies.

Just before the oil starts smoking, add the shallots, mushrooms and peppercorns and reduce the heat to medium. Sweat the vegetables until brown bits form on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes, then add the sugar. Add the red wine and port and deglaze the pan, scraping the brown bits off the bottom. Simmer the liquid until it has reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 40 minutes. Add the stock and cook until the liquid has reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 15 more minutes. Be sure to skim off any foam that forms on the surface. Transfer the liquid to a heatproof bowl. Add the thyme and bay leaf, then cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let infuse 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan and set aside. Make the steaks: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Thoroughly blot the meat dry and season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Add enough canola oil to 2 large skillets to cover the bottoms (about 2 tablespoons each) and set over high heat. Just before the oil starts smoking, add a steak to each skillet and cook 6 minutes. Check the bottoms of the steaks to see if they are charred to your liking. Flip the steaks with tongs and add 1 tablespoon butter to each skillet. Cook, tilting the skillets and spooning the butter over the steaks, 2 more minutes. Transfer the steaks to a rimmed baking sheet; transfer to the oven and bake until a meat thermometer registers 125 degrees F (medium rare), an additional 3 minutes. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest at least 7 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, warm the port wine reduction until it simmers. Stir in the berries and cook 30 seconds. Remove from the heat. Slice the steak off the bone in 1 piece with a sharp knife, then slice the meat against the grain. Serve with the port wine reduction and crumbled blue cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 49797,&quot;Scallop Phyllo Pizza With Pinot Noir Sauce 15 phyllo sheets, room temperature 16 ounces butter, melted Salt and white pepper 24 (U-10) scallops Olive oil, to saute 12 to 14 Peruvian purple potatoes, cut in 2-inch slices 10 ounces leeks 8 ounces tomato, seeded and small diced 8 chervil sprigs Pinot Noir Sauce, recipe follows 8 ounces butter, (2 sticks) 3 ounces shallots, minced 2 cups Pinot Noir 1 bay leaf Whole peppercorns 1 cup heavy cream Sea salt 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Spread a heaping tablespoon of the whipped cream onto one side of 39 chocolate wafer cookies (wipe the spoon clean with a rubber spatula between dollops). Spread the whipped cream out on the cookies with a small offset spatula. Stack 5 cookies on top of each other. Repeat with the remaining cookies (including the one without whipped cream) so that you have 8 stacks total. One of the stacks will have a cookie on top with no whipped cream; this stack will be the top stack. To build the log: Lay out a piece of plastic wrap about 20 inches long on the countertop. Working across the entire length of the plastic wrap, lay one of the cookie stacks on its side. Gently press the remaining 7 cookies stacks together, end to end, finishing with the top stack, to make one long cookie log that&#39;s about 15 to 18 inches long. Wrap the log up in the plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. While your stack is chilling, make the ganache: Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the remaining 1 1/2 cups heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan and pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 10 minutes, then stir until completely melt. Pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer and refrigerate until completely cool, about 30 minutes. Just before frosting, whip the ganache until it just begins to loosen up, turns lighter in color and is spreadable, 30 to 45 seconds. It&#39;s important not to overwhip or it will become grainy. Cut a 2- to 3- inch diagonal piece from the top end of the log and place it on top of the log at an angle; this will be the branch. Spread the ganache over the log to cover it completely. Heat a metal fork. Use the tines and the back of a the fork to draw a bark pattern in the ganache, running it along the surface in short strokes. To make the mushrooms: Shave the tops of 6 of the meringues with a rasp grater until they are smooth and round and resemble mushroom caps. Smooth the tops with a wet finger. Mix together 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar with 1/4 teaspoon water in a small bowl to make a glue. Smear a little of the sugar glue on the bottom of each meringue and stick a marshmallow to it to make a stem. To make a shorter stem, simply cut the marshmallow in half with kitchen shears. Let the mushrooms sit for 30 minutes until the sugar water has hardened. Dust the tops with cocoa powder. Decorate the cake with the mushrooms, rosemary, mint and cranberries.

Add the peanuts and salt to the crumb mixture and process until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until combined. Transfer the crust mixture into a 9 1/2-inch diameter glass pie dish, pressing and forming the crust evenly across the bottom and up the sides. Refrigerate for 10 to 20 minutes to solidify the butter. For the cream filling: Using a hand-held mixer, whip the cream cheese and butter at medium speed until fluffy with minimal lumps. Add the powdered sugar and cinnamon, whipping at low speed until just combined and being careful not to curdle the butter. Add the cream and whip to soft peaks. To assemble the pie: Spread the dulce de leche on top of the chilled crust. Top with the sliced bananas, forming 2 layers if necessary. Pour the whipped cream on top and spread evenly to completely cover the banana layer. Refrigerate and chill until set, about 2 hours. To serve, top the pie with a 1-inch border of the remaining chopped peanuts. Warm the remaining dulce de leche in the microwave or on the stovetop until melted.

Drain the tuna, reserving the oil, about 1/3 cup. If you do not have 1/3 cup oil from the tuna, add enough extra-virgin olive oil to yield 1/3 cup. Use your hands to tear the bread slices into large pieces and put in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until only fine crumbs remain, about 2 cups. Place the breadcrumbs on a baking sheet and toss with the reserved tuna oil. Season liberally with salt. Bake until light golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes, gently tossing the crumbs occasionally. Cool slightly on a cooling rack, and then use your hands to break up any large chunks. Meanwhile, bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil (it should taste like sea water). While the water is coming to a boil, make the pasta sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large, straight-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and a large pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic softens and starts to lightly brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the grape tomatoes, capers and white wine. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the tomatoes start to soften and the wine is reduced by half, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the romaine and drained tuna. Season liberally with salt and cook until the romaine is completely wilted and the tuna is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat. Cook the pasta in the salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and then drain the pasta. Toss the pasta with the tuna sauce in a large mixing bowl. Use as little or as much of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce to your taste. Season with additional salt and crushed red pepper flakes if needed. To serve, divide the pasta among 4 to 6 plates, top with the toasted breadcrumbs and drizzle with additional olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 49832,&quot;Corn Cakes with Crab and Smoky Avocado Yogurt 2 ripe avocados, diced 1 cup Greek yogurt (2 percent) 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves<br> 2 teaspoons chipotle in adobo puree (see Cook&#39;s Note) Juice of 1/2 lime Kosher salt and pepper<br> 1 cup whole milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced, plus more for cooking the corn cakes<br> 1 tablespoon clover honey<br> 1 1/2 cups corn flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayenne powder<br> 2 large eggs, separated<br> 2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels<br> 1 large egg white<br> 8 ounces jumbo lump crab meat Microgreens, for garnish Instructions: For the avocado yogurt: Put the avocados, yogurt, cilantro, chipotle puree, lime juice and some salt and pepper in a blender.

Beat the egg yolk, vinegar and 1 1/2 tablespoons cold water in a liquid measuring cup with a fork. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and gently stir with a fork until just moistened. Gently gather into a ball, then shape into a disk on a lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edge with your fingers; set aside. Make the filling: Gently toss the pears with the lemon zest, lemon juice, ginger and flour in a bowl. Spread the marmalade on the bottom of the pie crust. Add the pear mixture, keeping the pears as flat as possible. Make the topping: Combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until fine crumbs form. Scatter the topping over the filling and gently pat down. Bake the pie 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until the topping is lightly browned and the filling is bubbling, about 40 more minutes (cover with foil if the topping is browning too quickly). Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49839,&quot;Smoked Turkey Gravy 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds smoked turkey neck bones, large dice<br> 2 ribs celery, rough chopped<br> 2 carrots, rough chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1 medium onion, rough chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth (or turkey stock if available)<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> Instructions: In a heavy-bottom saucepan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and chopped turkey necks, browning the bones on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, garlic and onion and saute until the onions are translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium, then add the flour to create a roux. Stir well and cook until the roux is a deep brown color and has a nutty aroma, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the chicken broth and thyme, while using a whisk to stir. Stir and cook until the gravy is smooth and there are no lumps. Bring to a boil then simmer to reduce slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove the gravy from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a smaller saucepan. Discard the solids. Taste and adjust seasoning. Keep warm until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Rioja]&quot; 49840,&quot;Slow-Cooker Cuban Sandwiches 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 to 4 cloves garlic, minced Juice of 1 lime Juice of 1 small orange 3 to 3 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, skin removed 1 24-inch sub roll or two 12-inch soft Italian sub rolls Yellow mustard, for serving 8 ounces honey ham, thinly sliced 8 ounces Swiss cheese, thickly sliced 1 cup sliced dill pickles 1 red onion, thinly sliced Instructions: Prepare the pork: Mix the olive oil, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, the cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, garlic, lime juice and orange juice in a small bowl. Make slits all over the pork with a paring knife and rub with the oil mixture. Transfer the pork to a 6- to 7-quart slow cooker and top with any juices from the bowl. Cover and cook on low until tender, 8 hours. Transfer the pork to a bowl and let cool slightly. Shred into thick chunks with 2 forks, then return to the slow cooker and keep warm in the cooking liquid. Assemble the sandwiches: Slice the roll or rolls in half lengthwise and smear both sides with mustard. Layer on the ham, cheese, pulled pork, pickles and onion and cut into portions. Or, start on opposing ends and race to the middle! &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 49841,&quot;Truffles 1 recipe Master Ganache, recipe follows, with the addition of: 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 2 tablespoons liqueur, such as Grand Marnier, kirsch, bourbon, or rum 2 cups sifted unsweetened cocoa powder 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate Instructions: Follow the method for Master Ganache, adding the butter to the chocolate and the corn syrup to the cream before bringing the cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream and corn syrup over the chopped chocolate and butter. Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, stir slowly in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted, about 2 minutes. Add the liqueur and stir to combine. Allow the ganache to cool at room temperature until it is firm. This should take at least 4 hours in a 65 degree F room or 2 hours in the refrigerator. Once the ganache is firm, it can be formed into truffle balls. Using a piping bag, a mini ice cream scoop, or a tablespoon, make 1 inch diameter blobs. Then roll the blobs into somewhat uniform balls by hand. This is messy, no doubt about it. If they begin to warm up and become soft, refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes. If you have hot hands or it is a hot day, it may feel as though you can&#39;t get a grip on the truffle. Work near a sink with cold running water. When the ganache feels like it&#39;s melting, cool your hands under the running water then dry them and dust with a little cocoa powder. Be careful not to get too much cocoa powder on the truffles, or they will taste like cocoa powder. After the truffles are rolled, they can be finished in a variety of ways. The original cocoa powder is the easiest, and quite good. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a serrated knife, finely chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch pieces and place in a medium heatproof bowl. Fill a medium saucepan half full of water, bring it to a simmer, and then turn off the heat. Create a double boiler by placing the bowl on top of the saucepan. Stir the chocolate occasionally with a rubber spatula until it melts, about 2 minutes. When the chocolate has melted, take it off the heat. Stir it slowly with a rubber spatula until the temperature drops to 90 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Place the remaining cocoa powder in a small bowl. Drop 1 rolled ganache ball in the melted chocolate. Remove it with a fork, tap off the excess chocolate, and toss it into the cocoa powder. Roll the truffle around in the cocoa until it is well coated. Transfer the truffle to the prepared baking sheet and let it harden. Repeat with each truffle, coating 1 at a time. Can deep, dark, intense, rich, velvety smooth chocolate be a spiritual experience? It certainly is heavenly when mixed with cream. Praise the pastry angels and pass the bonbons! This is the basic ganache recipe. Use it for truffles, tarts, fillings, you name it. Follow the same technique when adjusting the recipe for firm and soft ganache. An alternative food processor method is given, which can be applied to any ganache recipe in this chapter. My desire is not only to introduce you to ganache but also to make it a staple in your refrigerator. As long as you don&#39;t eat it all as a midnight snack, it can be available to help you throw together dessert at a moment&#39;s notice. 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate 1 cup heavy cream Using a serrated knife, finely chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch pieces. Don&#39;t be lazy here. Big chunks will not melt. Traditional method: Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boiling means the cream will actually rise up in the pan and threaten to boil over. Immediately pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate. Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let it sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl, and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until all the chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. It may look done after 1 minute of stirring, but keep going to be sure it&#39;s emulsified. Food processor method: Place the chopped chocolate in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat (or bring to a boil in the microwave.) Immediately pour the hot cream into the food processor, on top of the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then pulse the machine 3 times. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and pulse 3 more times, until all the chocolate is melted. This smooth, silky chocolate is now ganache. Transfer the ganache to a bowl. Let the ganache sit at room temperature until it cools to 70 degrees F. In a 65 degree F room, this will take approximately 4 hours or 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can speed up the process by pouring the ganache out onto a clean baking sheet (thinner layers cool faster.) Once the ganache reaches 70 degrees F, it is ready to be used. At this point it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Rinse and drain 7 to 8 pounds wings. Pour some of the Red Hot hot sauce over them, and toss. Add seasoning mixture (above) until generously coated. You will lose some in the cooking, so don&#39;t skimp! Place the wings on a gas grill (or smoker) and slow cook them at a low temperature. After 20 minutes baste/mist with sprayer at least every 10 minutes. Flip them after you mist them. Total cooking time should be around 1 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on the heat of the grill. They&#39;re done when they break at the joint or you can break the wing tip off. Combine ingredients and warm on stove or in microwave, then put in spray bottle and set aside. . &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 49844,&quot;Ahi Tuna Melt 6 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 5 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 8 tablespoons cayenne pepper<br> 5 tablespoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay<br> Salt 1 pound ahi tuna<br> 4 egg whites<br> 1 tablespoon cream of tartar<br> 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 5 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 1 cup vegetable oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates<br> 1/4 cup diced bread-and-butter pickles 2 tablespoons butter<br> 1 yellow onion, sliced<br> 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce<br> 8 slices white bread or marble rye 4 slices pepper Jack cheese 4 slices Swiss cheese Instructions: In a bowl, stir together the thyme, garlic powder, 4 tablespoons of the cayenne, 3 tablespoons of the seafood seasoning and 2 tablespoons salt. Slice the tuna and coat on both sides with the spice mixture. Set aside to let the spices soak in. Place the egg whites in a blender and add the cream of tartar, vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning. Blend at high speed while slowly pouring in the oil. Once thickened, add the pickles and the remaining 4 tablespoons cayenne and blend. Place in a bowl, cover and chill. Add the butter to a large skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the onions, Worcestershire and the remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are slightly wilted down. Prepare a grill or grill pan for cooking over medium-high heat and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread the Creole mayo remoulade on the bread slices. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the tuna for 1 minute per side, then remove to a baking sheet. Layer the Jack cheese and Swiss cheese on 4 of the bread slices, over the remoulade, and top with the cooked onions. Arrange the tuna on top of the onions, then close the bread to make sandwiches. Bake the sandwiches to melt the cheese, 8 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 49845,&quot;Apple Cider (Baked) Donuts Nonstick baking spray, for the pans 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg<br> Zest of 1 lemon<br> 1/3 cup apple cider concentrate (for more depth of flavor) or apple cider<br> 1/4 cup buttermilk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, melted 1 cup granulated sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamon<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray four 6-cavity donut pans with nonstick baking spray. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon zest. Whisk for 30 seconds to distribute the leavening. In a liquid measure cup, combine the cider, buttermilk and vanilla. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar. Mix on high until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. With the mixer on low, add one-third of the flour mixture and then half of the cider mixture. Continue alternating between the two until the batter is just combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and, using a large rubber spatula, fold the batter a few times to make sure the ingredients are well distributed. Transfer the batter to a piping bag or a large zip-close bag with a corner snipped off, and pipe into two of the donut pans. Top each pan with a second, inverted pan and use clips to hold them in place. (Some pans come with clips; otherwise, use metal hardware or paper clips.) Bake until the cake just springs back when gently touched, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn the donuts out onto a cooling rack; immediately brush with melted butter, then dip in the cinnamon sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 49846,&quot;Lemon Upside-Down Cake 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda Pinch cinnamon 3 large eggs 1 1/4 cups whole milk 1 cup olive oil 1 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Juice and zest of 1 lemon 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup light brown sugar 2 lemons, sliced paper thin and seeds removed (about 20 slices) 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon in a small bowl. Whisk together the eggs, milk, olive oil, sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, lemon juice and zest in a large bowl. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and whisk to combine. Set aside. Place a shallow enameled Dutch oven over direct heat. Add the butter and melt. Continue to toast the butter until it becomes brown and nutty, 1 to 2 minutes. Swirl the butter up the sides of the Dutch oven as you are toasting it to prevent the cake from sticking. After the butter has browned, whisk in the brown sugar and allow it to melt. The mixture will resemble wet sand and won&#39;t get completely smooth. Take the Dutch oven off the heat and shingle the lemon slices in, covering the whole surface. Keep in mind that this will be the top of your cake. Pour the batter into the Dutch oven and put it back over indirect heat. Close the grill and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out dry, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the cake from the grill and allow it to cool for 5 minutes. Invert the cake onto a platter and continue to cool until ready to serve. Meanwhile, place a 2-cup glass jar with a lid in the freezer for 20 minutes. When the jar is cold, pour in the cream and add the sugar and the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla. Vigorously shake until you end up with soft whipped cream, about 5 minutes. Cut the cake into 8 slices and serve with a dollop of whipped cream on top. (Alternatively, you can bake the cake in a 350 degrees F oven for 50 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 49847,&quot;Limoncello Granita 1 1/2 cups Lemon Simple Syrup, recipe follows 1 cup (8 ounces) mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup limoncello liqueur Pinch fine sea salt 1 cup sugar 1 cups water 1 lemon, zested and juiced Instructions: Place the simple syrup, mascarpone cheese, limoncello, and salt in a food processor.

Line a baking sheet with a baking mat or parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the flour, ground oats, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir to combine. Add the butter pieces and use a pastry cutter to work the butter and dry ingredients together until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the chopped pecans. Whisk together the cream, maple extract and egg in a small bowl. Pour into the flour mixture, stirring gently until it all comes together. (The mixture will not come together in one cohesive ball; it should be in a few large clumps with some crumbs in the bowl.) If it is overly crumbly and will not come together at all, add a couple of tablespoons of extra cream and work it in. Turn the dough out onto a cutting board or floured surface and use your hands to press it into a 6- to 8-inch circle about 3/4 inch thick. Cut into 8 equal wedges (or you can cut into smaller wedges to get more). Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and bake until poufy and set and just barely golden, 20 to 24 minutes. (They shouldn&#39;t have much color on them at all.) Allow to cool completely. For the icing: Combine the powdered sugar, milk, butter, coffee and maple extract in a large bowl. Make sure the icing&#39;s thick but still pourable. Drizzle a very generous amount of the icing onto each scone, then sprinkle on a few more chopped pecans. Allow the icing to set completely, then serve.

Add the onions and cook to sweat. Add the chipotles, chili powder and garlic powder, and saute for 2 minutes. Add the ketchup, molasses, mustard, Worcestershire and vinegar, and bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook the sauce at a simmer for 30 minutes. Puree the sauce in a blender and add the salt and pepper. For the mayo: Combine the egg, egg yolk, lemon juice, Sriracha, garlic and mustard in a container and puree with a stick blender. With the blender running, slowly add the oil to the mixture to emulsify the mayonnaise and add the salt and pepper. For the coleslaw: In a bowl combine the cabbage, carrots and scallions. In a separate bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, honey and vinegar. Combine the dressing with the cabbage mixture, and mix well. Allow the slaw to sit for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld. For the eggs: Preheat the oil in a deep fryer to 350 to 375 degrees F. In a food processor, combine the pulled pork, egg yolks and 1 cup of the prepared BBQ sauce. Pulse the mixture until combined. Divide the mixture into 6 portions. Dip your hands in water and pat out one of the portions flat. Place a poached egg in the center and wrap the pulled pork around the egg. Repeat for the remaining eggs. For the breading: Whisk together the eggs and milk. Coat the wrapped eggs in egg wash then dip in the breadcrumbs. Repeat the process, dip each wrapped egg in the egg wash and then the breadcrumbs again. Deep-fry the eggs until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. To plate, place 2 tablespoons of the BBQ sauce on one side of the plate, and with the tip of the spoon quickly drag the center of the sauce to the other side of the plate. Place a 1/2 cup of the coleslaw in the middle of the plate, creating a nest in the center of the slaw. Place a fried egg in the coleslaw nest. Drizzle the Sriracha mayo over the top of the Dino Egg.

Meanwhile, melt the jelly in the microwave until soft enough to spread, about 1 minute. Spread the jelly with a pastry brush or an offset spatula over the crust. Return to the oven and cook another 10 minutes. Cool crust completely on a wire rack, 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, yolks, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, flour, and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat until thick and slightly pale. Stir in the citrus juices and zest, and whisk gently to blend well. Pour the filling onto the cooled crust and bake until the filling is firm but still loose and wobbly in the center, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight before cutting. Remove bars from refrigerator and dip the bottom of it in warm water to soften the butter and release the foil from the sides of the pan. Use foil to lift pastry out of the baking pan and transfer to a cutting board. Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut into about 50 1 1/2-inch squares, wiping down the knife with a hot, wet towel between cuts. Top each square with a tiny triangular segment of clementine or blood orange (with the peel on) and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49858,&quot;Zucchini Tomato Sauce with Fat Spaghetti 1/4 cup EVOO 3 small, firm zucchini, seeded and chopped 1 small onion, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 cl pepper, seeded and finely chopped or 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1/2 cup dry red or white wine One 28- to 32-ounce can San Marzano tomatoes 1 cup passata or tomato sauce A few leaves fresh basil, torn 1 pound pici or bucatini pasta 2 tablespoons butter Grated Pecorino cheese (tangy) or Parmigiano-Reggiano (buttery, nutty) Instructions: Heat a Dutch oven or pot over medium to medium-high heat.

For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter, then dust twelve 6-ounce ramekins with the streusel mixture. Place the ramekins on a sheet pan. Combine the buttermilk and vanilla extract in a liquid measuring cup. Set aside. Combine the granulated sugar and lemon zest in the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl. Rub the lemon zest into the sugar. Add the flour, baking powder and salt. Beat on low speed until well blended. Add the oil with the mixer running on low speed; once that is evenly distributed, add the butter a tablespoon at a time, beating until fully incorporated. The mixture will have the consistency of coarse sand. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stop to scrape down the bowl. On medium speed, gradually add the buttermilk mixture, mixing until the batter just comes together. Do not overmix. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins halfway, then sprinkle about 2 teaspoons streusel evenly on the batter in each. Spoon more batter on top to fill each ramekin three-quarters of the way. Use a table knife or skewer to gently swirl the streusel into the batter, as though you were making a marble cake. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the ramekins comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Transfer the sheet pan to a wire rack; let the cakes cool completely. For the quick creme fraiche: Stir the heavy cream, sour cream and salt together in a small bowl. Set aside. For the caramel sauce: Meanwhile, mix the granulated sugar, lemon juice and salt in a deep saucepan and place on medium heat. Have a pastry brush and a small bowl of water nearby to wash the sides of the pan of any granules of sugar. When the sugar starts to brown, swirl the pan to ensure even browning. Once the sugar is amber in color, pour in the bourbon (step back, because there will be sputtering). Add the butter in 4 pieces. Swirl the pan to melt the butter, then add the heavy cream, cinnamon and ginger. Remove from the heat. The caramel will continue to thicken off the heat. Stir before serving. Turn the cakes out of the ramekins. To serve, place a cake on a serving plate. Spoon the caramel over the cake with a dollop of \\creme fraiche.\\ Garnish with the crystallized ginger. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 49860,&quot;Bowties with Pancetta, Grilled Salmon and Artichokes, and Mixed Greens with Russian-Peppercorn Dressing 1 pound bowtie (farfalle) pasta 2 teaspoons olive oil 1/2 cup diced pancetta 1 cup reduced-sodium vegetable or chicken broth 2 reserved grilled salmon steaks, cut into 2-inch pieces 1 cup quartered oil-packed artichoke hearts 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 4 cups mixed salad greens 1/2 cup Russian dressing 1 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns Instructions: Cook pasta according to package directions.

Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Add the eggs, vanilla, yeast mixture, lemon zest and nutmeg; stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead until soft and smooth, about 5 minutes. Knead in the butter in three additions, dusting the dough with flour if it is too sticky. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. For the filling: Combine the artichoke hearts, spinach, cream cheese, mozzarella, Parmesan, a pinch of salt and some pepper in a food processor and process until smooth. For the topping: Whisk the flour, panko, a pinch salt and some pepper in a medium bowl, then work in the butter with your fingers until the mixture is sandy and chunky. Stir in the Parmesan and parsley and set aside. For the assembly: Cut the dough in half with a bench scraper or chef&#39;s knife. Using a rolling pin, roll each half into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Using an offset spatula, spread the filling on both dough rectangles, all the way to the edges. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the Parmesan and 1/4 cup of the mozzarella all over the filling on each dough rectangle. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Starting from the long side, tightly roll each rectangle into a log. Wrap each log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Unwrap the logs and cut each in half lengthwise with a bench scraper or chef&#39;s knife. For each babka, twist the 2 halves together a few times, starting from the middle. Coat two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray and line each with parchment, leaving an overhang on the 2 longer sides so you can pull the babka out of the pan after baking. Place a babka snuggly in each pan and sprinkle with the topping. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Drizzle the melted butter all over the babkas. Bake until browned, about 45 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes, then remove the babkas from the pans and remove the parchment.

Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking sheet (otherwise known as a quarter sheet pan) with some cooking spray. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or you can use a food processor), cream your butter with the sugar and almond extract until light and fluffy. Whisk the flour and salt in a small bowl, making sure there are no lumps. Turn the mixer speed to low, add the flour into your butter and mix until just incorporated. (Make sure not to over-mix.) Turn the dough onto the baking sheet, flour your hands and press it out evenly on the bottom and up the sides. Pop in the fridge for an hour (or overnight) to chill. Pop the crust in the oven and bake until a light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack. For the filling: While the crust is cooling, make your filling. Crack your eggs into a large bowl and add the sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice and flour. Whisk until combined. Pour into the crust and spread evenly. Put back in the oven and bake until the filling is completely set, about 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before serving.

Cook the rice with 2 1/2 cups water in a rice cooker according to the manufacturer directions for sushi/sweet rice, about 30 minutes. Place the cooked rice in a wooden or stone bowl. (I don\\u2019t recommend stainless steel or plastic bowls, which will make the rice wet or too soft.) Smash the rice with a thick wooden stick or pestle. Use your hands to turn the rice and continue to pound with the stick until it is a smooth and sticky dough, 6 to 8 minutes. Portion out 20 to 24 mochi, about 2 tablespoons of dough per portion. Have a small bowl of water nearby to lightly wet hands if the dough is too sticky. Shape each portion into a round patty about 1 1/2 inches thick and dust each side of the mochi with mochiko or potato starch. For the mochi toppings: To make a sweet miso sauce, combine the miso, sugar and sake in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add your desired number of plain mochi and grill, brushing with soy sauce a couple of times on each side, until the mochi are caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Brush some of the remaining plain mochi (reserve some of them to serve with the sweet toppings) with about 1 tablespoon of the sweet miso sauce and top with a sprinkle of shichimi. To serve the savory mochi, wrap the soy-grilled and sweet miso-glazed mochi in nori and place on a plate or platter. For the sweet mochi toppings: Mix the kinako with the sugar in a small bowl. Dip to coat both sides of your desired number of mochi. Top each remaining plain mochi with adzuki paste, then sprinkle with the remaining kinako sugar, if desired.

Bake the butternut squash on a baking sheet for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until you can easily slide a knife into the upper part of the squash. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 20 minutes. Cut off the ends of the squash and pare away the skin. Cut the squash in half, removing the seeds. Dice the remaining flesh. Allow to cool completely. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package instructions. In a saute pan large enough to accommodate all of the pasta, over medium-high heat, add the oil, mushrooms, butternut squash and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for several minutes until the mushrooms begin to soften. You may need to add more oil, as the mushrooms may absorb the liquid. Add the garlic and mix to combine until garlic begins to brown and the sides of the butternut squash become brown as well. If the pasta is not finished yet, remove the saute pan from the heat and wait until the pasta is done. When the pasta is done, return the pan to high heat, quickly add the spinach and deglaze with the white wine, which will help wilt the spinach lightly. Season with salt and black pepper. Quickly drain the pasta, add it to the pan and toss to combine the ingredients, mixing in most of the grated parmesan while you are tossing. Transfer to a serving dish.

Add the spinach to the pot and cook until wilted, about 30 seconds; drain, then plunge into the ice water. Once chilled, remove the spinach to a kitchen towel and squeeze until dry. Combine the blanched spinach, whole eggs and egg yolk, olive oil and a big pinch of salt in a blender and blend until smooth. Mound the flour on a work surface. Make a well in the center, 4 to 5 inches in diameter with high walls. Add the spinach mixture to the well and, using a fork, gradually mix flour from the inner edge of the well into the wet ingredients. Continue incorporating the flour until a rough sticky dough forms. Use a spatula or bench scraper to gather up any loose bits of flour and dough, then use your hands to gather and knead the whole thing together. (If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.) Knead until a smooth and slightly tacky bright green dough forms, about 6 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces; press each into a rough rectangle. Cover 3 of the pieces and set aside. Lightly flour the remaining piece of dough and feed the dough through the widest setting on a pasta maker. Fold the strip in half and feed it through again. Move to the next setting and feed the dough through this setting twice without folding, lightly flouring as needed. Repeat until you are at the third-to-last setting. The dough will be thin but not transparent, about 1/8 inch thick. Lightly flour the pasta sheet, then transfer to a floured baking sheet; halve the sheet crosswise if it\\u2019s hanging off the baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining 3 pieces of dough. Attach a long noodle cutter to the pasta maker. Feed each sheet of dough through the cutter, gathering the pasta on the other side. Lightly sprinkle with flour and shape into a loose nest. Return to the baking sheet. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, gently separating the strands with tongs. Cook until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes.

While this is creaming, place the toasted hazelnuts in a food processor and finely chop them. Add the eggs and mix well. Scrape the sides of the bowl. Sift all the dry ingredients, and then add them to the egg mixture. Mix on low speed until incorporated. Lastly add the hazelnuts, and mix. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a half sheet pan with a silpat and sprinkle the mixture onto it. Place into the oven and bake until golden brown, approximately 15 minutes. Cool completely, place into a food processor and finely grind. In a bowl, mix together 3 cups of the crumbs with the 3 tablespoons of the melted butter. Press the crumbs into the bottom of a 12-inch round metal cake ring that is sitting on a flat half sheet pan lined with a silpat. Place the pan into the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Cool by placing into the freezer. In a saucepan, place the milk, cream, and glucose. Bring it to a simmer. While the milks are heating, place the egg yolks in a bowl with the sugar. Set up an ice bath for cooling the anglaise. Once the milks are hot, whisk some of the milk into the yolks and sugar to temper. Place the mixture back into the pot, and cook until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Strain the anglaise into a bowl and place the bowl in the ice bath. Stir to cool down. Once cool place into the ice cream machine. Spin until firm. While spinning place a metal bowl in the freezer to make it cold. Place the ice cream directly into the bowl and then fold 1/4th of the nutella into the ice cream working quickly. Spread the ice cream while soft onto the frozen biscotti crust, about 1-inch thick. Reserve the remaining ice cream. Place it back into the freezer and freeze until hard. At least 1 hour. Place the milk and cream into a saucepan. Mix the sugar and stabilizer together and then whisk it into the milk. Add the glucose powder, salt, and dry milk to the pan. Heat the mixture to 185 degrees F. While heating crack the eggs into a bowl, and place the trimolene along with them. Set up a bain marie with olive oil in it and have an ice bath ready. Once the milk is hot, whisk together the egg, trimolene mixture and temper the eggs very slowly, and put back on the fire for 30 seconds on low heat, stirring constantly. Strain the mixture into the bain over the oil. Stir to cool. Pour the mixture into the ice cream machine and spin until firm. Allow it to set up in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Place the cocoa butter into a bowl and put into the microwave to melt completely, approximately 2 to 4 minutes. Melt the chocolate in a bowl in the microwave as well. Stir so that it doesn&#39;t burn, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Mix the 2 together and burmix. Add the salt, and strain through a fine sieve. Set aside until ready to use. Keep in a warm location. In a medium saucepan bring the sugar, glucose and water to a boil. Be sure the sugar dissolves. Add the cocoa powder and whisk it well to combine. Lower the heat to low, and cook for 10 minutes. Be sure to stir it often or it will burn. While the cocoa is cooking heat the cream in another pan and heat to simmer. Turn the flame off and add the 72 percent chocolate. Allow it to sit until the cocoa is cooked. Whisk the chocolate well, and then combine the 2 cocoa mixtures together. Burmix them well, and strain through a fine sieve. Pour into a bain marie, and place in an ice bath until cool. Once cold set aside at room temperature until ready to use. In medium saucepan place the sugar, water and glucose. Bring to a boil and then add the blanched kalamata olives. Allow the olives to cook slowly in the syrup for 45 minutes on low heat. Drain, and cool completely. If the syrup gets too thick at any point add a bit more water. The olives should be soft and glossy when finished. Place all the ingredients except the lecithin and chocolate into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and turn off the heat. Add the lecithin and chocolate, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. Burmix the mixture well and then cool it in an ice bath. Set aside until ready to use at room temperature. Spread the tempered chocolate onto a sheet of acetate 4 by 4-inches in size. Using a cake comb, comb lines and once the chocolate is set, bend it around a wooden dowel. Chill, and remove dowel. Remove the acetate once ready to garnish. Now it should be ready to be cut. If it is nice and firm in texture, using hot water and a long none serrated knife, pull the ice cream out of the freezer. Cut the ice cream into 3-inch long logs by 1/2-inch thick. Place it back in the freezer and prepare to spray the ice cream. Pull the ice cream bars out of the freezer and spray them with the chocolate mixture. Place back into the freezer until ready to plate. Have your plates ready. Heat the chocolate sauce, and brush strokes across the plate. In a small saucepan, heat the foam until hot.

Grease the sides of a 9-inch springform pan with butter. Wrap the bottom of the pan in foil to prevent leaking. Combine the sugar, salt, 8 of the gingersnap cookies and the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until crumbly. Drizzle in the butter and continue pulsing until the mixture is the consistency of wet sand. Pour the mixture into the pan and push into the base and halfway up the sides using a glass with straight edges. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, and then let cool completely while you make the filling. For the filling: Stir together the pumpkin, dark brown sugar, cinnamon, eggs, banana, egg white and milk in a large bowl. Pour the filling into the baked crumb crust and bake for about 50 minutes. Let cool completely while you make the ginger whipped cream. For the ginger whipped cream: Whip the cream with the sugar until soft peaks form using a hand mixer. Fold in the ginger. Run a thin knife around the edge of the pie to release it from the pan. Load the whipped cream into a piping bag with a large star tip. Pipe rosettes around the perimeter of the pie and decorate with the 8 remaining gingersnap cookies. Cook&#39;s Note: Make sure you use a piping bag with a large star tip so the ginger bits in the whipped cream don&#39;t clog the tip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 49898,&quot;Bay Scallops with Pesto 3 cups fresh, cleaned basil leaves 2 cups fresh cleaned flat-leaf parsley 3 cups chopped walnuts 1 cup grated Parmesan 3 cups extra virgin olive oil, plus 3 tablespoons 1 pound bay scallops 2 cups sliced mushrooms 1 cup sliced zucchini Kosher salt 8 ounces linguine Instructions: Combine the basil, parsley, walnuts, and cheese in a food processor or mortar.

Rub all surfaces of the meat generously with salt and pepper. Put the ribs into a large baking dish that fits them all in a single layer. Drizzle the vinegar over the ribs and turn them over so they have vinegar on both sides. Let the ribs marinate, turning them occasionally at room temperature for up to 1 hour or in the refrigerator for up to 4 hours. (This longer marinating time may make the surface of the ribs turns grayish-white in spots. That is fine and the discoloration will disappear when they are grilled.) Heat a gas grill to medium-high or build a strong charcoal fire. Grill the ribs, turning them once, until well browned, even charred here and there, about 6 minutes per side. The ribs should be just a touch rarer than medium-anything less and they will be very chewy. Let them rest 4 to 5 minutes before serving. Pull the husks from the tomatillos and wash them under cool water until they no longer feel sticky. Cut them into quarters and put them into the work bowl of a food processor. Add the onion and garlic and process until smooth. Add the cilantro, jalapeno and lime juice and process until the jalapeno is finely chopped. Scrape the mixture into a small saucepan. Season lightly with salt and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is boiled off and the salsa looks relish-y, about 15 minutes. Cool before using. The sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. If refrigerated, you may want to add a little salt and/or lime juice to the salsa before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 49900,&quot;Beef Carpaccio 1 pound beef sirloin, trimmed of all fat and sinew 3/4 cup olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 8 large shallots, finely diced 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns Julienned Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh chives, for garnish Instructions: Chill 8 serving plates.

Open up the 2 pieces of pie crust dough and lay one down on your work surface. Dip your finger in water and run it around the perimeter of the dough. Place the second piece on top; the water will help them adhere to each other. Roll out the combined dough to a 12-inch circle and press into a 9-inch tart pan. Use a fork to gently prick holes all over the bottom of the crust. With your rolling pin, roll over the top of the tart pan to trim the excess dough. Place a piece of nonstick foil down onto the dough and fill it with dried beans, uncooked rice or pastry beans. Bake until the tart begins to cook and brown slightly, about 20 minutes; remove the foil and bake until a deep golden brown, for an additional 20 minutes. Set aside to cool while making the filling. The crust can also be made 1 day in advance, cooled and then covered in foil for later use.</li><li>Heat the cream, milk and sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid is simmering, about 5 minutes. Add the chocolate, turn off the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is thoroughly melted and the mixture is blended. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the egg into the cooled chocolate mixture.</li><li>Spread the jam over the bottom of the tart. Pour the chocolate mixture into the prepared tart over the jam and bake until the filling is slightly firm but still has a bit of movement in the center, 25 to 30 minutes.

Sprinkle each cutlet with salt and pepper on one side only; do not salt the side the prosciutto will be on or it will become too salty. Using a toothpick, secure a slice of prosciutto and a sage leaf on top of each cutlet.<br> Add the flour to a plate, sprinkle with salt and pepper and whisk together. Dredge each cutlet through the flour, shaking to get rid of the excess flour.<br> In a 12-inch skillet, melt the butter in the olive oil over medium-high heat. Then add 4 cutlets, prosciutto-side down, into the pan. Cook about 3 minutes on each side. Add the wine to the skillet and cook until the sharp smell of the wine is cooked off, about 3 minutes. Repeat with the remaining cutlets using a clean skillet. Serve the cutlets on a large platter and drizzle with the sauce. Garnish with fresh sage. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 49922,&quot;Quinoa Tabbouleh 1/2 cup quinoa (red or white), rinsed 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper A pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 3 bunches of fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped (about 4 cups), see Cook&#39;s Note* 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mint leaves 1 pint cherry tomatoes, quartered 1 English cucumber, diced Small handful jarred peppadew peppers or roasted red peppers, finely chopped Instructions: Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Meanwhile, in a small cast-iron skillet (if possible), toast the quinoa over moderately-high heat until the grains give off a nutty aroma and start to pop. Pour the quinoa into the boiling water, taking care that the pot doesn&#39;t boil over! Turn it down to a simmer, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove it from the heat and allow to cool. Whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, 1/2 rounded teaspoon of salt, pepper and nutmeg. Combine the parsley, mint, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, peppadews and the cooled cooked quinoa in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Taste for seasoning, and let sit for about 5 minutes before you serve. (This tastes even better the next day!) Another way to serve it is with the tabbouleh in the center of a platter encircled with endive or romaine leaves to scoop it up. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 49923,&quot;Sticky Rice with Mango 1 1/2 cups glutinous sweet rice Two 13.5-ounce cans unsweetened, whole coconut milk<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons sesame seeds<br> 1 large mango, slightly underripe, peeled, pitted and cut into 30 thin slices<br> Zest and juice from 1 small lime<br> Instructions: Put the rice in a large strainer inside a large bowl and rinse the rice repeatedly in cold water until the water is clear (not cloudy with starch). Cover the rice with cold water and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the rice overnight. Place the rice in a sieve or steam basket over a pot of simmering water. (The water should be at the level of a double boiler so it creates steam but no water actually touches the rice as it cooks.) Cover the pot to trap the steam. Cook until the rice is tender, 35 to 40 minutes. You can test by pressing a few grains between your fingers or, better, tasting a few grains. Transfer the rice in an even layer to a baking sheet. Cover loosely. Leave at room temperature. In a medium saucepan, simmer and reduce the coconut milk by about half, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt and simmer until the sugar dissolves, a few minutes more. Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl. Remove the sugar mixture from the heat, then add it to the bowl with the cooked rice and allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes. Gently combine the rice with the coconut mixture while breaking up the larger clumps of rice. Let it sit until the liquid is absorbed by the rice, at room temperature for 1 hour or up to overnight in the refrigerator. In a small pan, melt and lightly brown the butter over medium heat. Add the sesame seeds and immediately remove the pan from the heat, tossing to toast and coat the sesame seeds with the butter, 1 minute. Drain. Toss the mango slices with about 1 teaspoon of the lime juice and set aside. Using an ice cream scoop or a cup measure, mold the rice mix into individual bowls. Alternatively, mold onto 1 large serving platter. Top with the lime zest, remaining lime juice, mango slices and toasted sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 49924,&quot;Blueberry French Toast Casserole with Whipped Cream and Strawberries 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for buttering the dish One 1-pound day-old loaf challah or white bread, unsliced Two 6-ounce containers blueberries (about 2 1/4 cups) 6 large eggs 3 cups milk 1 1/4 cups heavy cream 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt One 16-ounce container strawberries, sliced One 6-ounce container raspberries 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting, optional Instructions: Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with butter. Slice the bread into 3/4-to-1-inch-thick slices. If your bread is very fresh, lightly toast the slices before assembling. Tile all the bread in the dish, each slice overlapping the next. Scatter the blueberries over the bread, letting some fall to the bottom of the dish. Whisk the eggs, milk, 1/2 cup cream, 2/3 cup granulated sugar, almond extract and salt in a medium bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Pour over the bread and berries and press gently to help the bread start soaking in the egg mixture. Cut the 2 tablespoons butter into small pieces and dot over the top of the casserole. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove and discard the plastic wrap. Bake the casserole until golden brown and set in the center, 45 to 50 minutes, tenting with foil if the bread starts to become too dark. Let stand 10 minutes. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar if desired. While the casserole bakes, toss the strawberries and raspberries with 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in a medium bowl and let stand until juicy. Before serving, whip the remaining 3/4 cup cream with the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Serve the casserole with a dollop of whipped cream and a generous spoonful of the berries with their juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 49925,&quot;Strawberry Yogurt Sauce 2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and halved (See Note) 1/2 cup plain yogurt 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice Sugar, to taste Instructions: In a blender, place the strawberries, yogurt, and lime juice and puree a few seconds until smooth.

Let the bread soak for about 1 minute per side; it should feel heavy but still hold its shape and not fall apart.<br> Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook 2 of the soaked bread slices until they are a deep golden brown, the custard has set and the insides are cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. The center of the bread will puff slightly while the crust will contract, making it look puckered. You may have to alternate between medium and medium-low heat if the bread browns too quickly or not fast enough. Transfer the slices to a rimmed baking sheet and hold in the warm oven.

Toss together the mushrooms, oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place the mushrooms in the air-fryer basket and fry until tender, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool, 5 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the Cheddar, Havarti cheese, cream cheese, chili powder, garlic powder and onion powder in a medium bowl. Divide the mixture into 4 portions. Form each portion into a disk about 3 1/2 inches wide to fit inside the mushroom caps. Once the mushrooms are cool enough to handle, horizontally cut off the upper third of each mushroom cap. Place 1 cheese disk inside each mushroom, gill-side up, and sandwich with the top of the mushroom cap, pressing down to cover the cheese filling. Whisk the flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small baking dish. Whisk the egg in a second baking dish. Put the panko in a third baking dish. Dredge the mushrooms in the flour, shake off any excess and coat in the egg mixture. Allow the excess egg to drip off, then coat in the panko, pressing to adhere. Spray the mushrooms with the cooking spray and place in the air fryer basket. Cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.

One will be for the spaghetti, one for the lobsters. It&#39;s best if the lobster pot has a lid. Place the lobsters in the boiling water headfirst and cover tightly with the lid. (If you happen to have lobsters of different weights, put the heaviest lobster in first, and wait a minute to add the others.) Boil the lobster for about 7 minutes and no longer than 8 minutes. You want it to be slightly underdone. Transfer the lobsters to a bowl and separate the heads from the tails, reserving them both in the bowl. Remove the lobster legs from the body/head and set aside. Heat the olive oil and lobster heads in a large 14-inch saute pan. Include any juices that have collected in the bowl. Roast the lobster heads in the oil for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, crack open the claws and remove the meat. Cut open the tails to remove the tail meat. Cut all of the meat into large, 1- to 2-inch pieces. Remove the lobster heads from the pan and discard. Add the chiles and garlic to the olive oil and cook for a few minutes until fragrant. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes, sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper and saute until they just begin breaking down. Cook the spaghetti in the second pot of boiling water along with 2 tablespoons of salt. Cook the pasta for 2 minutes less than indicated on the package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain the spaghetti. Add the lobster meat, reserved lobster legs and pasta to the tomato sauce and toss together for about a minute, adding pasta water as needed.

Combine the apple puree with the lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until thickened and reduced slightly, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature and store in a sanitized jar for up to a month. For the salted caramel: Heat the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, until the sugar turns golden. Stir until all of the sugar is dissolved and just starting to turn a lovely amber color. Turn heat to low, add the butter and stir to combine. Careful, it&#39;ll foam up. Then add the heavy cream, vanilla extract and salt, stirring to combine. You&#39;ll cook the sauce for 5 to 10 minutes, until it comes together. It&#39;ll take quite a bit of stirring! Let caramel cool to room temperature, pour into a glass jar and store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Pour over everything and anything! For the crepes: Pop the flour, both sugars, salt, milk, eggs and melted butter in a large bowl and blend together thoroughly. If at all lumpy, strain. Heat a large saute pan over medium heat. Lightly coat or spray with vegetable oil and ladle a scoop of the batter into the center of the pan. Tilt the pan, rotating in a circle, to spread the entire crepe out. It should be about 9 inches wide and very thin. Cook until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Set aside on a plate. Cook the remaining batter until you have about 20 crepes. For assembly: Place a crepe on a cake platter and spread 3 to 4 tablespoons of the mascarpone over the crepe. Top with another crepe, and spread with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the salted caramel sauce. Top that with another crepe, and spread with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the apple-cinnamon puree. Repeat this process until you&#39;ve layered 20 crepes. Pop the crepe cake in the fridge for at least 3 hours (preferably overnight) to set. When ready to serve, remove from the fridge and let it sit on the counter for about 20 minutes to take the chill off. Sprinkle the top with sea salt and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 49943,&quot;Potato Focaccia 1 envelope active dry yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup lukewarm whole milk 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surface 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 teaspoon salt, preferably gray salt 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 3/4 cup diced pancetta or bacon (about 1/4 pound, cut in 1/2-inch dice) 1 1/2 cups peeled and diced, new or russet potatoes (about 1/2 pound, cut in 1/2-inch dice) 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves Gray salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, to coat the baking sheet and the dough Instructions: Combine the yeast, sugar, and milk in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add 1/2 cup of the flour. Stir well, cover with a towel, and let rest in a warm place for 25 minutes. Mix in the olive oil, salt, and 1 cup of flour, until well incorporated. Add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough adheres to the hook. It should remain soft and slightly sticky. Continue mixing for about 6 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Remove from the bowl, shape the dough into a ball, flatten slightly, and put into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat. Cover the bowl with a towel and put in a warm place for about 1 hour, to let the dough rise until doubled. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook slowly until very crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain. Reserve the pancetta and fat separately. Put the potatoes in cold salted water, cover, and bring to a boil. Cook about 8 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and place in a bowl. Pour the pancetta fat over the warm potatoes, add the crisped pancetta, 1 teaspoon of the rosemary, salt and pepper to taste, and the lemon zest. Toss well and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Oil a baking sheet. Lightly flour the dough and punch it down. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead lightly until smooth.

Clean the portabello mushrooms: cut off and discard the dirty stalk bottoms before turning the mushroom upside-down, to prevent loose dirt from falling onto the gills. Then, invert the mushroom (cap down), and remove the remaining stalk by cutting off the base of the cap. Set aside for later use. With a cleaning brush, remove any loose dirt from the cap, and the underside. For a final cleaning, wipe the cap with a moistened towel. Lay the caps, gills down, on a cutting board. Cut through the caps to make cross section slices about 1/3 inch thick. Pile slices on a plate or tray. Vigorously shake the marinade in the jar, then pour into a large bowl. Brush the grill lightly with olive oil. With tongs, grab 1 1/2 mushrooms worth of mushroom slices, and immerse briefly into the bowl of marinade. Loosen the tongs somewhat and quickly stir/swish the mushrooms around, to let all surfaces of the mushroom get coated. Then immediately pull the slices out, allow to drip-drain for a moment over the bowl, and spread, cut surfaces down, onto the grill. Note: it is very important to not let the mushrooms sit too long in the marinade?the gills will get soggy, and the end result will be ruined. Grill the mushrooms until well browned on one side. Baste the upper sides with the marinade, and turn. Cook until second side is well grilled. (Total cooking time is 4 to 8 minutes, depending on fire temperature, the mushroom slice-thickness, and desired doneness.) Remove mushrooms from the grill onto serving plate. Repeat with the remaining mushroom slices. Cool briefly, and enjoy! Mix all the liquids into a sauce pan, and bring to a high simmer. While heating, coarsely chop the garlic and ginger, and stir into the heating liquid. Cook at a high simmer, uncovered, for a bout 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. Pour into a glass jar, seal with a tight lid, and refrigerate overnight. (Marinade can be used immediately, but flavors will improve overnight). &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 49954,&quot;Key Lime Coconut Cupcakes with White Chocolate Frosting 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 2 eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 heaping teaspoon grated key lime zest 1 1/2 tablespoons key lime juice (bottled or freshly squeezed) 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 1/3 cups loosely packed sweetened coconut flakes (3.5 ounces) 5 ounces good quality white chocolate, chopped into small chucks 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted Pinch salt 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon key lime juice (bottled or freshly squeezed) 1/4 cup sour cream Finely grated key lime zest, for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Add the vanilla extract, key lime zest and juice and mix well. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In 5 parts total, alternately add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk to the batter, beginning and ending with the dry. Mix until just combined. Fold the coconut into the cupcake batter. Line a muffin pan with paper liners and fill each liner almost to the top with batter. A spring loaded 1/4 cup ice cream scoop works great for this and ensures the cupcakes are all the same size. Bake for 25 minutes or until the tops begin to brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Remove cupcakes from oven and allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then transfer cupcakes to a baking rack to cool completely. While the cupcakes are cooling you can make the frosting. In a small heat proof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, carefully and slowly melt the white chocolate. Remove from heat and let cool until just slightly warm. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter until light and fluffy. With the mixer on low, gradually add the powdered sugar until well combined. Add the salt, vanilla extract, key lime juice, and sour cream and mix until very smooth. Add the melted white chocolate and mix just until incorporated. Frost the cupcakes and garnish with a bit of grated key lime zest. Enjoy! A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe.

Split the lobster shells and clean by removing the light green tomalley (liver) in the body cavity and the feathery gills at the head section. Save the peeling from fresh cooked or raw shrimp. Discard the digestive tract, but save the heads if any. In a large stock pot heat olive oil and fish bones, lobster shells and shrimp shells. Cook over medium heat for 20 minutes to give broth a rich flavor. Meanwhile, put the vegetables in a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse to finely chop. Add the vegetables to the stock pot and saute them along with the fish bones for 15 minutes to sweat and caramelize the vegetables. Add the tomato, saffron and other herbs and seasonings and continue to saute for 10 minutes. Stir to ensure that nothing burns or sticks to the bottom of the pan. Add the white wine and reduce by half. Add the fish stock and water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and cook 1 1/2 hours. Skim a foamy particles that rise to the surface during cooking.
