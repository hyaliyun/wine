Two peaches, for example, would be more than sufficient. Take your time to clean and slice the fruit as neatly as possible. This is a recipe where presentation counts.<br> The fruits can be cut ahead of time. Sprinkle with lemon juice and cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready.<br> To make the broth, combine the pineapple juice, lemon juice, honey, ginger and Grand Mariner in a saucepan. Bring quickly to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook 5 minutes before removing from heat. Cool completely.<br> When ready to serve, allow 10 to 15 minutes to prepare. Use soup plates with broad, flat bottoms and arrange a mixture of the fruit in a colorful pattern across the bottom of the plate, possibly putting some of the slices in a pinwheel-type arrangements with little mounds of diced fruit or berries in the center. Once you have all the fruit divided among the plates, ladle several tablespoons of the cool broth over the fruit.<br> There should be just enough broth in each plate to cover the bottom; it should not be soupy. A possible garnish would be a small scoop of sorbet on each plate and perhaps a sprinkling of grated coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 2461,&quot;Green Eggs and Ham One 3 x 5-inch slice Pizza Bianca Focaccia, recipe follows, or any focaccia 3 tablespoons Double Cream Ricotta, recipe follows, or any ricotta 2 tablespoons Classic Pesto, recipe follows, or any pesto Plenty of shaved pecorino<br> 4 ounces prosciutto cotto (Italian boiled ham), thinly sliced<br> 1 egg<br> Pinch of red cl flakes<br> 275 grams plus 25 grams water 7 grams active dry yeast<br> 25 grams plus 15 grams olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan<br> 550 grams all-purpose flour<br> 7 grams pure cane sugar<br> 10 grams kosher salt<br> 20 grams dried oregano<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves<br> 1 tablespoon wild fennel pollen (optional)<br> 1 tablespoon Maldon salt, or any fancy salt of your choice<br> 4 cups whole milk 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 tablespoon sea salt Zest and juice of 1 Meyer lemon 1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar 2 cups olive oil 4 cups basil leaves<br> 1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted<br> 1 cup grated pecorino cheese<br> Zest and juice of 1 lemon<br> 1 garlic clove, finely grated<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: To assemble 1 open-faced sandwich, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F or turn the broiler to low. Set the focaccia on a baking sheet or in an ovenproof dish. Dot it with dollops of ricotta, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the pesto, and top with pecorino and the prosciutto cotto. Either crack the egg directly on the top and bake until the egg is set, about 10 minutes, or prepare a sunny-up and bake the pizza bianca separately until slightly crisp on the edges, then lay the egg on top. To finish, top the egg with remaining 1 tablespoon pesto, plenty of pecorino, and a pinch of cl flakes. Cut it in half if you intend to share, but don&#39;t feel bad if you scarf this down solo. Measure 275 grams of water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and add the yeast. Disperse with your hand, then add 25 grams olive oil, the flour, and sugar. Mix briefly on low speed to combine the ingredients, then let rest (autolyse), covered, for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with the kosher salt and add the remaining 25 grams water. Mix on speed 1 (low speed) for 5 to 7 minutes, until the dough begins to pull from the sides of the bowl and appears shiny and smooth. Turn the dough out onto a greased baking sheet and cover loosely with well-oiled plastic. (The easiest way to oil a sheet of plastic is simply to drag it across the greased baking sheet.) Let the dough rise for 1 hour; it will be quite puffy and fill nearly three-fourths of the baking sheet. (This first rise on the baking sheet uses gravity to help spread and stretch the dough.) Gently remove the plastic and use well-oiled fingertips to poke the dough and stretch to fill the pan. (This step fulfills the same purpose as a punch down or pre-shape in some of our other breads. You&#39;re taking away some of the gas while encouraging the dough to take its final shape.) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cover the focaccia with well-oiled plastic, and let it proof for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the dough fills the entire pan. Gently remove the plastic and give the dough one last well-oiled poke. Sprinkle with the oregano, rosemary, and fennel pollen (if using). Drizzle with the remaining 15 grams olive oil. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden. Sprinkle with the Maldon salt. To make the ricotta, in a large saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to 180 degrees F over medium heat, being very careful not to let it boil. Add the salt, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vinegar and stir to combine. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest 10 minutes. Set a colander over a large bowl and line the colander with cheesecloth. Using a measuring cup or a large ladle, give the pot another good stir. You will see that the curds and whey have separated. Gently ladle the curds into the colander. If you&#39;re going for ultimate richness, try not to break up the curds as you make this transfer. Let the ricotta drain in the fridge for about 2 hours, then remove it from the cheesecloth and store it in an airtight container in the fridge, where it will last for 7 days. (If you like, drain some of the whey from the bowl and reserve it for another use, such as a great probiotic lemonade.) In a blender, puree the olive oil and basil at high speed. Do not let it go too long or the heat from the blender will turn the basil brown. Add the pine nuts and puree another 1 minute, or until smooth. Pour the basil puree into a bowl and stir in the pecorino, lemon zest, lemon juice, and garlic. Season with salt to taste and store in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 30 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 2462,&quot;Spreads 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup (2 sticks) butter<br> 1 egg<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 6 to 8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips<br> Assorted toppings as needed: chopped granola, chopped nuts, colored sprinkles, mini marshmallows, crushed graham crackers, chopped candy, caramel sauce Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix together the brown sugar and butter in a large bowl. Add the egg and mix together. Add the flour, vanilla and salt and mix together well. Spread the dough onto a baking sheet to a thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch. Bake until slightly brown, 15 to 18 minutes. At this point, pull the sheet out of the oven and sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the top. Return to the oven for 1 minute. Remove and spread the melted chips over the top. Sprinkle on the desired toppings, and then chill to set. Cut into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2463,&quot;String Bean and Onion Salad 1 quart water 2 pounds haricots verts 2 large red onions, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste Instructions: Bring the water to a boil in a medium-sized saucepan. Trim and wash the beans, remove any blemished ones, place them in the boiling water, and cook for about 5 minutes, or until they are tender but still slightly crisp. Drain the beans, place them in a glass salad bowl, and allow them to cool. Place the onion slices in a small bowl, cover them with the lemon juice, and allow them to soak for 30 minutes. When ready to serve, add the onions to the string beans, drizzle them with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 2464,&quot;Chili Paste 6 shallots, peeled 1 tablespoon coarse ground black pepper 2 Serrano chiles 3 Thai bird chiles 6 cloves garlic 2 stalks lemon grass, chopped, white part only 2 tablespoons minced ginger 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 limes, juiced 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce Canola oil Instructions: In a food processor, combine all ingredients.

Bring to a simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the carrot and onion and cook until crisp but tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the cucumber and put into a small bowl. Discard the peppercorns. Set aside until ready to use or refrigerate for 1 hour, if desired. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Rinse the fish fillets and pat dry. Coat them in lime juice, season with salt and pepper and flour both sides. Carefully, add the fish, skin side down, to the skillet and fry until the bottom is golden and releases easily from the pan, about 3 minutes. Flip the fillets and sear until cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the fish to a nonreactive serving platter. Serve warm or cold, pouring the pickled garnish over fish just before serving. If serving cold, refrigerate separately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2466,&quot;German Potato Salad 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, sliced 1/2-inch thick 4 ounces bacon, chopped<br> Kosher Salt<br> 1 yellow onion, chopped<br> 1 cup low-sodium chicken stock 1/4 cup white wine vinegar<br> 2 tablespoon grainy mustard<br> 1 bunch chives, chopped<br> Instructions: Place the sliced potatoes in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until fork tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes. Let cool slightly, then transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. While the potatoes are cooking, place the bacon and some salt in a large saute pan. Cook over medium-low heat until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and add it to the bowl with the potatoes. Add the onions and a pinch of salt to the hot pan and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, vinegar, mustard and chives and bring to a boil. Pour the dressing over the potatoes and toss to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Cava]&quot; 2467,&quot;Red, White, and Blue Trifle 1 box red velvet cake mix, about 18 ounces (if you can&#39;t find red velvet cake use 1 box chocolate cake plus a bottle of red food coloring) 1 (16-ounce) tub whipped topping 2 pints blueberries 1 pint strawberries, tops removed Instructions: Bake the red velvet cake mix according to package directions and allow to cool. Using a serrated knife cut the red velvet cake into 1-inch square pieces and line the bottom of the trifle bowl with half of the cake squares. Using a spatula, spread about a 2-inch layer of whipped topping on top of the cake squares. Layer about 1 1/2 pints of the blueberries on top of whipped topping.

Drain and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly butter a 12-inch oval or gratin baking dish and place it in a large brownie pan. Mix the tapioca, soy milk, sugar, and salt in a heavy nonaluminum saucepan. Bring the soy milk to a boil over medium heat while whisking. Lower the heat and let the mixture simmer 10 minutes, whisking occasionally. Remove from the heat and quickly whisk in the egg yolks, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until just stiff. Whisk 1/2 a cupful into the tapioca, then fold the remaining in. Pour the tapioca mixture into the prepared baking dish. Place the baking dish and brownie pan in the middle shelf of the oven and pour several inches of boiling water around the outside. Bake about 35 minutes, until the top is puffed and golden. The inside will still be a little soft.

Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang on 2 sides; spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. For the crust: Add the flour, cornstarch, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse 10 times until combined. Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse sand, about 30 times. (The dough will not come together in one mass.) Sprinkle the mixture evenly in the prepared pan and lightly pat it down. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. For the filling: Combine the eggs, yolks, sugar, flour, salt and lemon juice in a medium saucepan. Whisk continuously over medium heat, occasionally scraping down the sides and edges of the pan with a rubber spatula, until simmering and thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the lemon zest and butter until combined. Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Pour the filling over the crust and bake until just set, 12 to 15 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours. Use the foil overhang to lift the bars from the pan. Remove the foil and slice into squares.

Let sit for 5 minutes, until the yeast begins to bubble and foam. Add the flour and kosher salt to a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix until just combined. With the mixer off, add the yeast mixture. Turn the mixer back on and knead, gradually increasing the speed from low to medium, until the flour and yeast are combined and the dough looks shaggy. Turn the mixer off again and add the melted butter. Mix, slowly increasing the speed to medium, until the dough holds together and the butter is completely incorporated, about 30 seconds. With the mixer on the lowest speed, knead the dough for 3 minutes. If the dough moves too high up the hook and is no longer being kneaded, turn the mixer off and push the dough back down. Coat a large bowl with the olive oil. Remove the dough from the stand mixer, form into a ball and place in the greased bowl. (The dough will feel tacky when it comes out of the mixer but should come out in one piece. If necessary, knead additional flour into the dough, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the desired consistency is reached.) Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size. For the marinara sauce: Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a medium saucepot. Add the onions and saute until softened, 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook an additional 30 seconds, until fragrant but not browned. Stir in the tomato paste, oregano, crushed red pepper and salt; cook for 30 seconds. Pour in the stewed tomatoes, breaking up any large pieces. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste. Let cool. (Makes 1 1/4 cups.) For the sausage pizza: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the sweet Italian sausage and hot Italian sausage and cook until browned, breaking up the sausage into small pieces. Remove to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Combine the mozzarella and Asiago in a bowl and reserve in the refrigerator. Place the proofed pizza dough on a lightly-floured work surface. Dust the top of the dough with flour and roll into a 14-inch round, about 1/4-inch thick. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin and transfer to a 10-inch nonstick springform pan. As evenly as possible, unroll the dough over the springform pan and guide the dough into the pan, pressing it evenly into the bottom and working it gently all the way into the edges. Next, lift the sides of the dough up and press against the sides of the pan, making sure the dough doesn&#39;t fold over itself at any point. The dough should come 2 inches up the sides of the pan. Add half of the cheese to the bottom of the crust, top with half of the sausage and then cover the sausage with the marinara sauce. Add the remaining cheese, followed by the rest of the sausage. Fold the top of the pizza dough over so that it sits evenly on top of the filling. Place the pizza on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Rotate, cover with foil, and bake an additional 20 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven when the crust is a deep golden brown and the cheese is melted. Let rest for 15 minutes before removing the sides of the springform pan. Serve with torn basil scattered over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 2478,&quot;Macaroni and Cheese Egg Roll 1/2 pound elbow macaroni 3 tablespoons kosher salt, plus additional for salting water and seasoning egg rolls 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup milk 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 2 tablespoons onion powder<br> 3 teaspoons ground black pepper, plus additional for seasoning egg rolls<br> 8 square egg roll wrappers<br> 1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water Oil, for frying 2 tablespoons smoked paprika<br> 1 bunch fresh chives<br> Instructions: Boil noodles to al dente in salted water.

Put the flour in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs and milk in another shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Put the bread crumbs in a third dish and again season with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge each piece of pork in flour, then in the egg and finally into the bread crumbs, pressing the bread crumbs onto the pork gently so they have a nice even coating. Lay the breaded pork cutlets in a single layer on a plate lined with parchment and refrigerate, uncovered, for 10 to 12 minutes to allow the coating to dry out a little and adhere to the pork. Heat oil and butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the thyme sprig and let it fry for about 1 minute to infuse the oil. Remove the thyme sprig and reserve. Gently lay the cutlets into the pan and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with salt and transfer to a serving platter while still hot. Garnish with lemon wedges and the fried thyme sprig before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2481,&quot;Casa Chimayo Red Posole 2 to 3 pounds pork shoulder 1 teaspoon salt 1 bay leaf 1 onion, chopped fine 2 to 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon ground cumin 10 to 12 Casa Chimayo red cl pods* (see Cook&#39;s Note), rinsed, stems and seeds removed 4 cloves fresh, peeled garlic Salt 1 pound posole, dried and soaked overnight, or frozen and defrosted** (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 onion, quartered 1 teaspoon salt Optional garnishes: sliced limes, chopped fresh cilantro, finely chopped onion, oregano, cubed avocado, or grated cheese Instructions: You will essentially be preparing this recipe in three stages: pork, cl and posole. These are then combined into the final posole. For the pork: Place the pork shoulder in a pot and cover with water. Add the salt, bay leaf and onion. Bring to a boil, and then cook over medium heat until tender and falling off the bone, about 1 1/2 hrs. Remove the meat from the broth and let cool; reserve the broth for later. Pull the meat from the bones and cut into bite-size pieces. For the cl: Put the cl pods in about 2 cups of the hot broth (enough to allow the pods to puree easily in a blender) and let soak until soft, about 20 minutes. Put the broth, pods and garlic in a blender and blend until smooth. (Do not fill the blender more than halfway with liquid.) Add salt to taste and set aside. For the posole: Drain and rinse the posole. Put the posole in a cooking pot and cover with water; use about 2 parts water to 1 part posole. Add the onion and salt. Bring to a boil, and then lower the heat and simmer until the posole has started to \\bloom, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The posole will swell and start to resemble popcorn, but will still be chewy. At this point, add the pork, cl and any remaining broth into the posole and let it finish cooking. The key to a successful posole is watching for it to finish blooming. Posole is fully cooked when it has opened completely, and is tender when chewed. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve in a bowl and place the garnishes on the table so that each person fixes their own. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 2482,&quot;Sunset Martini 1 3/4 ounces raspberry vodka (recommended: Stoli Razberi) 2 ounces pineapple juice Dash Triple Sec Dash grenadine Instructions: Fill a cocktail shaker with ice.

In a mixer with a paddle attachment cream the butter well; then add the sugar and continue creaming until light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time and then the vanilla. On the low setting, add the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Divide the dough in half and return half the dough to the mixer. Add the warm melted chocolate and mix to combine. Shape both pieces of dough into 4 by 4-inch square, and wrap them in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes. Cut each square into 4 strips then place them on a sheet pan and keep chilled while you roll out the dough. Between pieces of parchment paper, roll out a piece of chocolate dough into a rectangle 6 by 7 inches (have a ruler nearby). Roll a piece of vanilla dough out into a 6 by 6-inch square. Peel off the top pieces of parchment from both doughs and flip the vanilla dough onto the chocolate, allowing 1/2-inch border of chocolate dough around the top and bottom. Press the 2 doughs together lightly with a cake pan or other flat pan. Peel off the top piece of parchment and fold the 1/2-inch of over hanging chocolate dough up and over the vanilla dough. Use the parchment to roll up the dough into a tight pinwheel. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill 4 to 5 hours (roll the dough a couple times the first hour so it doesn&#39;t develop a flat side). Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a sheet pan. Unwrap the roll and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Place them 1 1/2 inches apart on the sheet pan and bake for 9 to 11 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2526,&quot;Ginger and Apple Martinis 1 1/3 cups Ginger Simple Syrup, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups 100% apple juice, chilled 1 cup dark rum, chilled 1/2 cup club soda or sparkling water, chilled Ice 1 green or red apple, unpeeled, cored and thinly sliced 1 cup sugar 1 cup water 1 (2-inch) piece of fresh ginger, peeled and chopped Instructions: In a pitcher, combine the simple syrup, apple juice, rum, and sparkling water.

Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening and rolling until the sheet is about 1/4-inch thick; (keep in mind, overly thick pasta tastes gummy.) Now, using the spaghetti cutting attachment, run the sheets through the cutting slot. Dust the noodles and a baking sheet with cornmeal. Coil the spaghetti strands into a nest and allow the pasta to dry for about 10 minutes before boiling. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add spaghetti. Cook for a few minutes until al dente. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 2553,&quot;Fiery Angel Hair Pasta 1 pound angel hair pasta 1/2 cup Chili Oil, recipe follows 1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 1 lemon, juiced 2 tablespoons lemon zest Coarse sea salt Dried crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel, optional 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan 2 cups olive oil 4 teaspoons dried crushed red pepper flakes Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the angel hair pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. Stir the oil, parsley, lemon juice and lemon peel in a large serving bowl. Add the cooked pasta and toss with enough reserved pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time, to moisten. Season the pasta with salt and red pepper flakes, to taste. Sprinkle grated lemon peel over pasta for extra flavor and texture. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and serve. Combine the oil and crushed red pepper flakes in a heavy small saucepan. Cook over low heat until a thermometer inserted into the oil registers 180 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Transfer the oil and pepper flakes to a 4-ounce bottle. Seal the lid. Refrigerate up to 1 month.

In another bowl, whip the egg whites until frothy, gradually adding the sugar until the foam becomes stiff. Fold half of the whipped egg whites into the yolks. Fold in the remaining egg whites thoroughly, until uniform in color. In 4 batches, fold in the sifted flour and the baking powder then the butter. Immediately pour the batter into two 10-inch greased cake pans and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven F for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool on a rack. After they&#39;ve cooled, run the tip of a knife around the edge of the cakes to loosen them from the pans and remove. Using a long serrated knife, slice both cakes into 1/2-inch thick disks. Only 3 will be needed, reserve the rest for future use. Place a 10-inch springform pan without a bottom on a 12-inch cakeboard. Place 1 layer of the sponge cake on the bottom, and generously brush with the syrup. Spread the jam evenly over the syrup and place a second layer of sponge cake on top of the jam. Brush with syrup and spread the prepared cream on this layer. Top with a third layer of sponge cake and again, brush with the syrup. Using your hands, press lightly on the cake to ensure cake is level. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove the springform mold from the cake and generously frost the sides with the reserved Whipped Cream. Pour the remaining Whipped Cream directly on the center of the top of the cake and using a spatula, make a mound, working from the center out. The height of the Whipped Cream should be approximately 1 1/2-inches in the center and about 1/2-inch on the edges. Dust a work surface again with confectioners&#39; sugar and roll the light green marzipan to a 1/10-inch thick circle, using as much confectioners&#39; sugar as necessary during rolling to prevent the marzipan from sticking to the work surface. When you&#39;re finished rolling, marzipan should be stretched enough to cover the entire cake and sides. Roll marzipan on rolling pin and gently lay it down on top of the cake, smoothing out the dome and lightly pressing on the bottom edges of the cake to form a perfect dome. Decorate with leftover marzipan, making a braided border on the edge of the cake or simply dust the entire cake with confectioners&#39; sugar. Bring the milk and vanilla bean to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes to infuse. Remove vanilla bean. Whisk the eggs, cornstarch, sugar, and salt in a bowl until smooth. Add half of the milk into the bowl containing the eggs, whisking constantly, then return the mixture to the saucepan containing the remaining milk, whisking over moderate heat. Continue whisking until the mixture is thickened and begins to simmer. Allow cream filling to simmer, whisking for an additional 2 minutes. Transfer into another bowl, cover and allow to cool completely. Whisk heavy cream with sugar until it is firm and holds its shape, being careful not to over whip. Fold one-fifth of the cream into the cooled pastry cream and refrigerate, covered, until chilled (approximately 1 hour). Reserve the remaining whipped cream in the refrigerator, covered. Bring water and sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan, remove from heat and allow to cool. Color a walnut size piece of marzipan with the green food coloring until the marzipan is deep green. Reserve. Using a sifter or a fine mesh strainer, dust a scrupulously clean work surface with confectioners&#39; sugar. Tear off a pea-sized piece of green marzipan and knead it with the remaining marzipan until it is uniform in color. Add additional pieces from the green marzipan until it achieves a light green color (it should be the color of a Granny Smith apple). Discard the leftover deep green marzipan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2555,&quot;Neely&#39;s Surf and Turf 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined, chopped Salt Cracked black pepper 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 large shallots, finely chopped 2 tablespoons white wine 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 sticks butter, room temperature 4 (10-ounce) New York strip steaks 2 tablespoons chopped chives, for garnish Instructions: Preheat grill to medium heat.

Set aside. Microwave the butter in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 45 seconds. Set aside. Put the shortbread cookies into a food processor and process until the cookies are broken down to fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and pulse until just combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Do not overmix or the cookies will become pasty.<br> Press the crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, then freeze while you make the cheesecake mixture.<br> Combine 1 package of gelatin with 2 tablespoons water in a small microwave-safe bowl and set aside to soften, about 5 minutes. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, sour cream, lemon juice, vanilla and salt and beat on medium-high speed until incorporated and smooth, about 1 minute.<br> Microwave the gelatin, stirring as needed, until melted, about 30 seconds. Add the gelatin to the cream cheese mixture and beat on medium-high speed to combine, about 30 seconds. Pour the cream cheese-gelatin mixture into the springform pan and smooth out the top. Tap the pan a few times on a flat tabletop to release any air bubbles in the cheesecake. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Once the cheesecake is set, prepare the white wine gelatin. Pour the white cranberry juice into a medium saucepan and sprinkle over the remaining 3 packages of gelatin. Let sit until the gelatin is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and heat over low heat, whisking occasionally, just until the gelatin and sugar dissolve, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Pour the gelatin mixture into a large bowl and stir in the white wine. Use a spoon to scoop away any bubbles at the surface. Refrigerate, stirring every 10 minutes, until the gelatin just begins to thicken and is the consistency of thin fruit jelly, 30 to 45 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, trim away the green tops from the strawberries. The trimmed strawberries should be no longer than 1 1/2 inches tall (1 inch is ideal). Slice the strawberries into 1/4-inch-thick pieces, saving any small end pieces for another use.<br> Starting from the outside edge of the cheesecake, shingle the strawberries (pointed side outward and upward) in a circular pattern, leaning the tips of the strawberries against the edge of the pan, about 26 strawberry slices total. Continue this pattern, working inward and making 3 additional concentric circles with the strawberries overlapping each other, leaving at least 2 1/2 inches of empty space in the center of the cheesecake. (You may have strawberries left over.) Arrange the mandarin oranges in the center (rounded side outward and upward) so that the cheesecake is completely covered.<br> Use a large spoon to stir the gelatin until mostly smooth. Gently spoon the mixture evenly on top of the fruit, then use the back of an offset spatula to smooth out the top as much as possible. (For a really smooth top, dip the offset spatula into boiling water, wipe it dry and smooth out the top further.) Refrigerate the cheesecake until the gelatin is completely set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.<br> Use an offset spatula to carefully loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan, then open the clasp and remove the outer ring.

For the shortcake: Toss the dry ingredients together in a large bowl, mixing well. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, egg and oil. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, beating lightly with a spoon. This will become a very thick-like cookie dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out until 3/4 inches thick. Cut into biscuits about 2-inches in diameter (I use a juice glass). Spray a perforated grill pan with the butter cooking spray and put on the grill to heat. When hot, add the biscuits and cook for 5 to 10 minutes; (check your heat to make sure the biscuits don&#39;t burn). Flip and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. Combine the margarine, honey and brandy in a small sauce pot over low heat. When the margarine has melted, remove from the heat. At this point the biscuits are ready to split, even if they&#39;re not fully cooked. Baste the split sides with basting sauce and put back on the grill, split sides down. Once back on the grill baste the tops with more of the basting sauce. Cook for 5 minutes, flipping and basting until the biscuits have good grill marks and are crispy. biscuit. Cook&#39;s Note: IMPORTANT! The biscuits need to cook for about 15 minutes (about half way) and then add the strawberries to the grill pan with the biscuits. Toss and sprinkle lightly with the cinnamon and splenda (it&#39;s ok if some gets on the biscuits too). The strawberries don&#39;t need to cook for too long- they get mushy if they&#39;re overcooked so it&#39;s a delicate dance you do here so it all comes out perfect and hot! When the biscuits are ready and the strawberries are steaming, lay the biscuits down, open faced, on desert plates. Top with the hot strawberries and a scoop of the ice cream. Garnish with fresh sliced strawberries and. drizzle with the remaining brandy basting sauce, for that extra sweet kick!

Butter a half sheet pan, line with parchment paper, butter the paper and dust with flour. Whip the egg whites to soft peaks. Beat in both sugars and whip to a stiff, glossy meringue. Alternately fold the cake flour and egg yolks into the meringue in 3 batches, starting and ending with the flour. Fold in the nuts. Spread the batter evenly in the pan, and bake until the cake is pale gold, the center springs back when you press it lightly with your finger, and the edges start to pull from the sides of the pan, 10 to 12 minutes. ; For the pastry cream: Whisk the yolks, cornstarch, and the 40 grams sugar in a medium bowl; the mixture will be very thick, but try to whisk enough to remove most of the lumps. Put the 75 grams sugar in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until dark brown; don&#39;t worry if it crystallizes a bit. Turn the heat to low and whisk in the maple syrup, then whisk in the whisky, turn up the heat, and let simmer for 1 to 2 minutes to boil off the alcohol. Whisk the milk and vanilla bean scrapings into the caramel mixture and bring to simmer.

Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, salt and maple extract. Pour into a shallow dish, press plastic wrap onto the surface, and chill until set and very cold, about 4 hours. Beat the cold pastry cream in a standing mixer until smooth. When ready to use, whip the cream until it is very stiff, then beat into the pastry cream. Chill until ready to use. ; For the buttercream: Put the sugar in a medium pot and add enough water just to moisten; use your fingers to wet the sugar evenly. Bring to a boil. While the sugar is heating, start beating the yolks and egg in a standing mixer with the whisk attachment. When the syrup reaches about 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer (softball stage), pour it into the yolks with the mixer still running, taking care not to pour it onto the whisk. Beat until cooled to room temperature. Beat in the whisky and the maple extract. Cream the butter in another mixing bowl using the paddle attachment. Beat in the cooled egg mixture until smooth. You can use it right away, or chill it overnight; if you chill it, rebeat when you are ready to assemble the cake. ; For the sugared cranberries: Have a cookie sheet or shallow dish and a slotted spoon next to the stove. Put the sugar in a medium pot and add enough water just to moisten; use your fingers to wet the sugar evenly. Add the cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil, add the cranberries, and immediately pull from the heat. Transfer the cranberries to the cookie sheet with the slotted spoon. Cool. ; For the maple tuiles: Cream the butter, maple syrup, vanilla bean scrapings and salt until smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl and beat in egg whites until smooth. Beat in the flour. Let the batter rest and hour or so at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before baking. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with a silpat. Using a stencil, smear the batter thinly on the silpat and bake until dark golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the pan while still warm. If you want to shape the cookies, put them over a bottle or rolling pin while warm; let cool. If desired, brush lightly with luster dust. ; Assembly: Turn the cooled cake onto a piece of parchment or waxed paper with a long side near you. Spread the chilled pastry cream evenly over the surface, leaving a 2-inch border across from you. Using the parchment paper to lift, roll the cake as tightly as possible.

Fill a syringe and inject each turkey in the breast and thigh area, as well as the back, wings, and legs. You will have to fill the syringe several times. Next, combine the seasoning ingredients and rub the mixture evenly all over each turkey. Place the turkeys in large plastic bags and secure before icing them down or refrigerating them for 24 hours. To fry each turkey: Fill a large pot three quarters of the way full with the peanut oil and heat the oil to between 350 and 360 degrees F. Place 1 turkey in the basket insert and carefully and slowly lower it into the hot oil. Turn the turkey every 10 minutes, using long-handled forks. A whole turkey will take 3 to 5 minutes per pound to cook. It is done when the internal temperature reaches 170 to 180 degrees F on an instant read meat thermometer. Carefully lift the basket out of the hot oil. This can be done by inserting a broomstick through the handles and having two strong people lift the basket out of the pot. Using the long-handled forks, transfer the turkey to a large brown paper bag and let stand for about 15 minutes before removing to carve. Repeat the procedure for the second turkey. Carve the turkey and serve with the other traditional side items. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container.

Place a small dollop of the Ron&#39;s White Chocolate Buttercream in the center of the serving platter; this will help affix your cake to the platter. Then, put the first layer of cake on the platter. Apply a generous amount of buttercream to the top center of the cake. Using a flat spatula, spread the buttercream, starting at the center and moving outward to the sides of the cake. It&#39;s important to use enough buttercream and to let the spatula only touch the top of it, so you don&#39;t pick up any crumbs from the cake.<br> Next, fit the second layer on top and repeat. Then, refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes to harden the fillings/buttercream.<br> Repeat with the third layer and refrigerate for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.<br> Lastly, add the fourth layer and apply buttercream until evenly distributed on both the top and sides of the cake.<br> This makes a very tall cake. To serve, cut into strips the length of the cake and 2 inches wide and 1-inch thick rectangular cake slices. Place the sugar and egg whites in large metal mixer bowl set over simmering water.

Oil a jellyroll baking pan and line it with waxed paper oiled on both sides. Separate the yolks and whites in 2 bowls. Sift the flour and baking powder together. Beat the yolks until light and lemon colored, about 20 minutes. The consistency should be very thick, and when you lift the beaters, the mixture should fall in one solid mass, known as the \\ribbon stage. Add 1/2 cup of the sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time. Add the vanilla and beat 3 minutes more. Whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar slowly until it makes a meringue. Add the whites to the yolks one-third at a time and fold in with a rubber spatula. Add the flour all at once and fold in. Spread the batter in the pan and bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the cake comes away from the sides of the pan. Let it rest for 5 minutes, then remove it from the pan and place on a clean tea towel that has been dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar. Remove the waxed paper by rubbing the top of the paper with a dry cloth all over the surface and peeling off. Cover the cake with another tea towel and roll up the cake lengthwise in the towels, like a jellyroll, while still warm. For the filling: Whip the cream and vanilla until soft peaks form. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Add the fruit to the whipped cream and fold in. For the soaking liquid: Mix the milks with a whisk. Add the liquor. For the frosting: In a mixing bowl, beat the butter until soft and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Add the vanilla and mix for 2 minutes. Slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar until it is well incorporated. Add the milk. To assemble the cake: Unroll the cake and remove the tea towel from the top layer. Spread the whipped cream mixture on the cake and, using the bottom as leverage, roll it up lengthwise. Transfer the cake to a serving tray seam side down. Make holes in the cake with a skewer and drizzle the soaking liquid, slowly, letting it absorb bit by bit. Cover the cake with the frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 2663,&quot;Mini Biscuit Breakfast Sandwiches With Spicy Frittata 2 1/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose baking mix, such as Bisquick About 1/3 cup buttermilk, plus more for brushing About 1/3 cup milk 2 jalapenos<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 8 large eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 3 tablespoons canola oil<br> 8 ounces breakfast sausage<br> 1 small yellow onion, small dice (about 1 cup)<br> 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese<br> 1 large green tomato, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced<br> Instructions: Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Prepare the biscuits according to the package directions, replacing half of the milk with buttermilk (this will amount to about 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup buttermilk for most mixes). Roll or pat the dough into an approximately 8-inch round about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits out of the dough. You can reroll the scraps once and cut additional biscuits, making 14 to 16 biscuits total. Transfer the cut biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet and brush lightly with the remaining buttermilk. Bake until the tops are golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Allow to sit at room temperature while you prepare the eggs. Change the oven setting to broil. Put the jalapenos on a small baking sheet and place under the broiler until charred all over, turning the jalapenos as needed, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for 5 minutes, and then peel the skin away from the jalapenos. Roughly chop into small pieces, removing the seeds if you do not want the eggs too spicy. Set aside. Whisk the cream, eggs and some salt and pepper together in a large bowl. Heat the canola oil in a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the breakfast sausage and cook until browned, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, 4 to 6 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the browned meat to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions and cook until lightly caramelized, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the chopped jalapenos and browned sausage back to the pan and stir to combine. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and cook until the eggs just start to set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the cheese and continue to cook until the frittata is almost set but the top is still runny, about 3 minutes. Place the frittata under the broiler and broil until lightly puffed and the top is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, turn off the broiler and place the biscuits back in the oven. The residual heat of the oven will warm the biscuits through. After 5 minutes, use a rubber spatula to loosen the frittata from the pan and invert it onto a cutting board. Cut into 14 to 16 pieces (depending on how many biscuits you baked). Split open the warm biscuits and sandwich a piece of frittata and some sliced green tomato between each biscuit. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 2664,&quot;Sherla&#39;s Southern Greens 1 pound bacon, diced 2 Spanish onions, sliced 4 cloves garlic, sliced thin 1 pound collard greens 1 pound kale 1 pound mustard greens 1 pound Swiss chard 1 teaspoon red cl flakes 1 large pinch salt 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar Your favorite hot sauce (I love Sriracha) Instructions: In a large Dutch oven, add the bacon to the pan over medium heat and cook until the fat begins to render. When the bacon is almost crisp, add the onions and sweat for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat for an additional minute. Remove the tough stems of the greens and discard. Roughly chop the greens and tender stems and add them to the pan with the cl flakes and a large pinch of salt. Cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and add the vinegar and sugar. Put the lid back on and cook for an additional 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and check your seasoning; if it&#39;s not spicy enough for you, add your favorite hot sauce to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 2665,&quot;Swordfish Panini with Arugula and Lemon Aioli 2/3 cup mayonnaise 1 lemon, zested 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 clove garlic, minced 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 4 (6-ounce) pieces swordfish, about 1-inch thick Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon herbes de Provence 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 loaf focaccia bread 2 ounces (about 2 cups) fresh arugula greens Instructions: For the Lemon Aioli: Mix together all the ingredients in a small bowl.

Remove from the heat, let cool slightly then pour the mixture over the onions. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Stir in thyme before serving. Put the orange juice in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil. Using a paring knife, make a small slit in the center of the habanero and add to the orange juice along with the allspice berries. Cook until thickened and reduced to about 1 cup. Strain into a bowl and let cool slightly. Add the zest and vinegar and season with salt, pepper and honey, to taste, if needed. Combine the oil and basil in a blender and blend for 2 minutes.

Prepare a cookie sheet with parchment paper (to help with sticky pieces and cleanup). Peel the eggplant skin off, slice into thin pieces (round or oblong) and set aside. Prepare three large mixing bowls. Fill the first mixing bowl with flour. Whisk the eggs in the second mixing bowl. Fill the third mixing bowl with breadcrumbs. Lightly pat the eggplant in the flour on both sides, and then dip into eggs and finally the breadcrumbs. Place the eggplant on the prepared cookie sheet. Lightly drizzle olive oil on the eggplant. If you have a brush, brush the eggplant lightly. It doesn&#39;t need a lot of olive oil to get the crispiness. Bake the eggplant until crispy, about 15 minutes. In a lasagna-style baking dish, spread a light blanket of tomato sauce on the bottom. When starting the layers, lay the eggplant down side by side covering the bottom of the pan. It is best to use 1/2 ounce mozzarella and a little bit of sauce on each eggplant piece to keep it moist. Repeat this two to three times. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place into the oven for 25 minutes. Add more mozzarella to the top of the eggplant during the last 5 minutes of baking; it is a great way to avoid the cheese burn. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]</p><p>&quot; 2673,&quot;Skillet Cornbread With Strawberry Jam 1 1/4 cups coarsely ground cornmeal 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/3 cup whole milk 1 cup buttermilk 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 1 pound strawberries, hulled and halved 1 lemon Juice of 1/2 orange Pinch of salt 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: Make the cornbread: Place a 9-inch cast-iron skillet in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.

Salt cod needs a long soaking to remove the preserving salt, so start at least 1 day in advance. First, wash off excess salt under cold, running water. Place fish in a bowl, or crock, of cold water and refrigerate, changing the water several times. Soak until the fish feels soft and almost fresh, this will take a good 24 hours. Poach the salt cod. In a 2-quart pan, add onion, bay leaf, peppercorns, and water and bring to a simmer. After 5 minutes, add the drained soaked codfish and enough water to cover the fish. Bring to a simmer. When it comes to a simmer, cover immediately, and remove pan from heat (salt cod toughens if simmered more than a few seconds). Let stand for 10 minutes or until you are ready to use it. Drain the fish and flake it into a bowl. In a separate bowl, mash the potatoes. Using your hands or a wooden fork, mix the mashed potatoes in with flaked cod. The portions are up to you, more potato than fish is usually the norm. Suggested seasonings to be added at this point are chopped onion, chopped parsley, pepper, etc. In a cup, beat eggs with a pinch of salt. Beat 3/4 of eggs into the fish and potato mixture. Add more egg by drops if mixture is very stiff. Add a little cornmeal if the mixture is too wet. Let cool 20 minutes for easy forming. In a frying pan, heat about 1/2-inch of butter or bacon grease. Shape cod mixture into small patties, being sure to flatten out the centers. Just before placing in the frying pan, coat patties with cornmeal. Fry 2 to 3 minutes on each side until browned. Remove to a tray lined with paper towels. Keep warm in 200 degree F oven while frying the remaining. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 2679,&quot;Berry Shortcakes 1 3/4 cup flour 2 tablespoons sugar, and 2 additional tablespoons 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 stick unsalted sweet butter, chilled 1/2 cup light cream 4 cups mixed berries, fresh or frozen, thawed and drained Whip cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Add the onions, season with the salt, cover and cook until they are wilted and soft, about 10 minutes. Remove the lid and cook the onions until they are golden and caramelized, stirring often, about 20 minutes more. Stir in the garlic and saute 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook an additional 10 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Stirring consistently, cook until the tomatoes breakdown and the jam becomes thick, about 20 minutes. Yield: 3 cups Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll the puff pastry out on a floured surface to a rectangular shape, about 12 by 10 1/2 inches. Transfer the pastry sheet to a parchment-lined baking sheet. With the tines of a fork, dock a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the sheet and dock the center of the sheet a few times as well. This will prevent the dough from rising as it cooks. Spread the Caramelized Onion-Tomato Jam evenly over the pastry, leaving a small border around the edge of the pastry. Layer the tomatoes, eggplant, yellow squash and zucchini in overlapping rows, or in whatever pattern you like. Sprinkle the roasted red peppers around the tart. Drizzle the assembled tart with a little olive oil, making sure to brush a little on the edges, season with salt and pepper and top with half of the fresh oregano. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and puffed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with the goat cheese and the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 2700,&quot;Hot Dates 16 dates, pitted 3 Cheddar cheese snack sticks, cut in 1/2-inch cubes 16 whole almonds 8 slices bacon, cut in 1/2 Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Pulse to chop the herbs, then blend on high speed until smooth. Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture, breaking up any clumps of herbs. Sprinkle with the walnuts and currants and cook until the eggs start to set around the edges, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until the center is set but still slightly jiggly, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit 5 minutes. Meanwhile, warm the pita in the oven. Slice the kuku sabzi and the pita into wedges and divide among plates. Serve with lemon wedges, pickles, olives, pickled peppers and/or marinated artichokes.

Add the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk just until smooth. Transfer the batter to a 1-quart measuring cup or bowl with a spout for easy pouring. Heat a takoyaki pan over medium heat (see Cook&#39;s Note). Generously grease the \\u201choles\\u201d and the entire surface using a pastry brush. Fill each hole about three-fourths of the way with batter (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Working quickly, place the following in each hole: 2 to 3 pieces of octopus, a pinch of scallions, a pinch of tenkasu and a pinch of beni shoga. (If you find that the batter is cooking too quickly, reduce the heat a bit. It may take a few tries to get the timing down.) Top off each hole with a little more batter \\u2014 it\\u2019s fine if it overflows a bit. Let cook until the bottom of each takoyaki is set but the inside is still wet, about 3 minutes. Working quickly, use 1or 2 skewers or chopsticks (I find it easier with 2) to turn each takoyaki about 90 degrees, cutting through any batter on the surface between the holes and \\u201cscraping\\u201d it into each hole as you go, forming a rough ball shape. Let any batter run out of the balls and when it starts to set, turn the balls completely over and cook, regularly rotating them until they are evenly golden brown all over and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more (cooking time will depend on the size of the takayoki). Remove the balls to a platter, drizzle with takoyaki sauce and mayonnaise and then sprinkle with aonori and katsuobushi. Serve immediately and repeat with the remaining ingredients as needed. Combine the kombu and 3 cups cold water in a medium saucepan and let sit for about 30 minutes. (You can skip this step if you\\u2019re short on time but it does lend a little extra flavor.) Heat over medium heat until the water comes to a near boil, but doesn\\u2019t actually boil, about 5 minutes. Discard the kombu. Add the katsuobushi evenly over the water, bring to a boil over high heat and then immediately remove from the heat. Let steep for about 10 minutes without stirring. Pour the dashi through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl or quart-size measuring cup. Do not press down on the katsuobushi, which can make the dashi cloudy and/or bitter. Dashi is best used the day it is made but can be cooled and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Trim the stem and blossom ends from the zucchini and squash and cut them lengthwise into thin slices. Trim the eggplant and cut crosswise into 12 slices 1/4 to 3/8-inch thick. Peel the onion and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Trim the portobello mushroom stem even with the cap so it will lie flat on the grill. Brush all over with 1/2 tablespoon of the Rosemary Garlic Oil. Set aside. Set a cast iron grill pan over high heat and coat with vegetable cooking spray. Let it warm up for 3 to 5 minutes (or light your outdoor grill). Using a pastry brush, coat the zucchini, squash, eggplant, and red onion slices with about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the remaining oil; it will be a very thin film, but it should be enough. The peppers do not need any. Grill the vegetables, except the onion in batches as necessary, on each side, rotating them 45 degrees to make cross-hatch grill marks. They should be cooked until they are nicely browned, but not charred, cooked through but still hold their texture. The peppers will have black marks on the outside, but they are eaten with their skin and bright color intact. Grill the mushroom stem side down first, so when it is turned and finishes cooking, the juices will be retained. Reduce the heat to medium high and grill the onion, turning and rotating as described, until tender and browned but not burned. Here are the approximate cooking times, which will vary with your grill: Peppers - 6 to 7 minutes per side Zucchini and squash - 2 to 3 minutes on first side, 2 minutes on second Eggplant - 4 to 6 minutes per side Red Onion - 3 to 4 minutes per side Portobello - 5 to 6 minutes per side As the vegetables are cooked, transfer them to plates or a large baking sheet lined with wax paper. Transfer the portobello to a cutting board and let cool for at least 5 minutes; then slice. Be sure to reserve any mushroom juices. Season the grilled vegetables and mushroom lightly with salt and pepper. Line a large round or oval serving platter with the arugula. Arrange the grilled vegetables decoratively in bunches around the edge of the platter. Pile up the pepper wedges in the center. In a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar and lemon juice with the remaining Garlic Rosemary Oil. Mix in any reserved mushroom juices. Drizzle evenly over the salad. Crumble goat cheese on top. Serve at room temperature. Combine all the ingredients in a small glass jar with a lid. Let stand at room temperature at least 15 minutes, preferably 1 hour.

Stir in dried mushrooms and set aside to reconstitute, at least 30 minutes. Strain mushrooms before using, reserving liquid. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with heavily salted water by 2 inches. Bring potatoes to a boil and cook until fork tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Heat the oven on low broil and place a rack in the upper third. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a 3 to 4-quart Dutch oven (or oven-ready saucepan) over medium-high heat. When it foams, add half the mushrooms and cook, stirring rarely, until mushrooms are browned, about 5 minutes. Remove mushrooms from pan, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and set aside. Repeat to cook off remaining mushrooms. Return pan to stove over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the butter, onion, celery, and garlic, and cook until softened and golden, about 2 minutes. Add celery root, carrot, parsnip, and herbs, and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook until browned and softened, about 6 minutes. Add wine mixture to pan and deglaze by stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Let cook until simmering and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.

Add the ice cream. Place the lid back on tightly and pulse the blender a couple of times on and off to break up the larger pieces of ice, before whizzing up to a semi-slushy milkshake consistency. If you haven&#39;t got a blender, you can do as I have been known to do -- place the ice into a clean tea towel and bash the hell out of it with a rolling pin before stirring in the mashed fruit and the cream. It&#39;s good, but not quite as good. The 3 smoothies below can be made by following this basic recipe, using the listed ingredients as your chosen fruit. ; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot]&quot; 2733,&quot;Burrata and Kale Salsa Verde Bruschetta 1 1/2 cups chopped Tuscan kale (about 8 large leaves) 1 clove garlic, smashed<br> 3 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed<br> 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 1 teaspoon anchovy paste<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 loaf ciabatta bread, cut in half horizontally 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 8 ounces burrata or mozzarella (about 2 medium balls)<br> 3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted<br> 8 oil-marinated sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped Instructions: For the salsa verde: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the kale and garlic until roughly chopped.

Add water just to cover the hen. Do not fill above the cooker&#39;s \\maximum fill\\ line, or 2/3 full. Cover and lock the lid. Bring to pressure over high heat, approximately 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, so that you barely hear hissing from the pot. Cook for 45 minutes. Release the pressure using the cooker&#39;s release device (read the manual!) or cool the cooker by running cold water over the lid for 5 minutes. Open carefully. Remove the hen from the broth and set aside to cool. The meat should be tender and falling away from the bone. Once the hen is cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones in small pieces, cover and set aside. Discard the skin and bones. Set a cheesecloth-lined colander in a shallow, wide, 6-quart pot and strain the broth, discarding the solids. Taste and season the broth with additional salt, if needed. Put 1/2 cup of the broth, the butter, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a 2-quart saucier, set over high heat, and bring to a boil. As soon as it boils, add all of the flour at once and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture starts to come together, approximately 1 minute. Decrease the heat to low and continue stirring until the mixture forms a ball and is no longer sticky, approximately 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and mix, on low speed, for 5 minutes with an electric hand mixer. Beat until cool and there is no more steam rising. Continue to mix on low, and add the eggs, 1 at a time, making sure each is completely incorporated before adding another. You may need to stop occasionally and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Before adding the last egg, check the mixture for consistency: It should tear slightly as it falls from the beater, creating a \\V\\ shape. Transfer the dough to a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Cut off 1 corner of the bag to make a quarter-sized opening. Bring the broth to a slight simmer over medium heat. Pipe 1-inch of the mixture and cut with kitchen shears directly over the broth. Repeat with the remaining batter. Cook, covered, until the dumplings are cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the meat and wait for 2 to 3 minutes before serving. Serve in bowls with freshly ground black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2735,&quot;Cranberry Marinade for Pork 6 ounces fresh or frozen cranberries 1/2 cup water 1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange peel 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 1/2 cup packed golden brown sugar 2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 10 ounce pork tenderloins Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Combine cranberries, water and orange peel in heavy medium saucepan.

Line your muffin tins with paper cups. Whiz the squash in a food processor until finely chopped. Add the sugar, and crack in the eggs. Add a pinch of salt, the flour, baking powder, walnuts, cinnamon and olive oil and whiz together until well beaten. You may need to pause the machine at some point to scrape the mix down the sides with a rubber spatula. Try not to overdo it with the mixing - you want to just combine everything and no more. Fill the paper cups with the muffin mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Check to see whether they are cooked properly by sticking a wooden skewer or a knife right into one of the muffins - if it comes out clean, they&#39;re done. If it&#39;s a bit sticky, pop them back into the oven for a little longer. Remove from the oven and leave the muffins to cool on a wire rack.<br> As soon as the muffins are in the oven, make your runny frosted topping. Place most of the clementine zest, all the lemon zest and the lemon juice in a bowl. Add the sour cream, icing sugar and vanilla seeds and mix well. Taste and have a think about it - adjust the amount of lemon juice or icing sugar to balance the sweet and sour. Put into the fridge until your muffins have cooled down, then spoon the topping onto the muffins.<br> Serve on a lovely plate (on a cake stand if you&#39;re feeling elegant, or on a rustic slab if you&#39;re more of a hunter-gatherer type!), with the rest of the clementine zest sprinkled over. For an interesting flavor and look, a few dried lavender flowers or rose petals are fantastic.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 2758,&quot;Cranberry-Orange Scones 4 cups plus 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus extra for sprinkling 2 tablespoons baking powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons grated orange zest (2 oranges) 3/4 pound (3 sticks) cold unsalted butter, diced 4 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup (1/2 pint) cold heavy cream 1 cup dried cranberries 1 egg beaten with 2 tablespoons water, for egg wash 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 4 teaspoons freshly squeezed orange juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix 4 cups of flour, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, the baking powder, salt and orange zest. Add the cold butter and mix at the lowest speed until the butter is the size of peas. Combine the eggs and heavy cream and, with the mixer on low speed, slowly add to the flour and butter mixture. Mix until just blended. The dough will look lumpy! Combine the dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of flour, add to the dough and mix on low speed until blended. Dump the dough onto a well-floured board and knead it into a ball. Flour your hands and a rolling pin and roll the dough just under 1 inch thick. You should see small bits of butter in the dough. Keep moving the dough on the floured board so it doesn&#39;t stick. Flour a 3-inch round plain or fluted cutter and cut circles of dough. Place the scones on the prepared sheet pan. Collect the scraps neatly, roll them out and cut more circles. Brush the tops of the scones with the egg wash, sprinkle with granulated sugar and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are browned and the insides are fully baked. The scones will be firm to the touch. Allow the scones to cool for 15 minutes, then whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and orange juice and drizzle over the scones. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2759,&quot;Waka Waka Salad 1 cup canola oil 1 cup red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon minced ginger 1/2 packet ramen oriental seasoning Pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 head Napa cabbage, sliced 1/8-inch thick 1/4 head red cabbage, sliced 1/8-inch thick 1/2 head green cabbage, sliced 1/8-inch thick 2 red onions, thinly sliced 2 carrots, shredded 4 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 24 wonton skins, fried 3 ramen noodle bunches, broken into small pieces 3/4 cup Spanish peanuts, finely chopped Instructions: In a large bowl combine oil, vinegar, garlic, ginger, ramen seasoning, salt and pepper.

Peel the onions, carrots and garlic cloves and chop them; I use a food processor here, and do them in 2 batches of 2 each. Pour the oil into a very large, thick-bottomed pan and when it&#39;s warm add the chopped onions, carrots and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes, sprinkling in salt if the vegetables look as though they might burn. Drain the porcini, reserving the soaking liquid, chop them coarsely and add them to the vegetable mixture along with the button mushrooms. After about 5 minutes, when the fresh mushrooms have cooked down a bit into the mixture, transfer the vegetables to a plate so that you can start cooking the meat. Add a little more oil to the pan then add the minced meats, breaking them up with a wooden fork or spatula. Stir for about 5 minutes until the rawness has left them a bit, add salt liberally, and then return the vegetable mixture to the pan. Stir in the flour and, still stirring, pour in the mushroom-soaking liquid, tomatoes, tomato paste, Marsala and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Stir well, cover partly with a lid and turn down the heat so that the mixture bubbles gently with some of the liquid evaporating and the flavours intensifying, for about an hour. Even longer wouldn&#39;t do it any harm providing the heat is very low. Once cooked, taste for seasoning then remove from heat. If it helps you can cook the base in advance (either freezing it or leaving it in the fridge for a few days), which means that when you want to serve the pie, you have only to bother with the topping. Some people are happy to make a shepherd&#39;s pie in its entirety and then leaving it to be reheated, but I think that&#39;s only OK if you don&#39;t need to refrigerate it for days (it does something funny to the texture of the potatoes). An afternoon, even a longer stretch, in a cold wintry kitchen, though, is fine. An easier alternative might be to refrigerate the cooked base and leave the mashed potatoes and parsnips in a plastic wrapped bowl in a cold place in the kitchen for however long you need, bringing the two together just before they go into the oven. Given the amount of potatoes stipulated, I suggest you hand people a peeler if you have any around who ask if there&#39;s anything they can do to help. Or use a potato ricer, which means you don&#39;t need to peel them. Either way, boil the potatoes in a large pan of salted water until they are nearly tender and then add the parsnips which have been peeled and cut into chunks. Simmer until the potatoes and parsnips are cooked to easily mashable tenderness, but not to the point of disintegration, then drain them and let them dry slightly in the colander while you warm the milk and melt the butter in the heat of the pan that you cooked the potatoes in. Rice the potatoes and parsnips straight into this pan (or mash them) and then grate in some fresh nutmeg and add salt to taste. Put the meat mixture into a large dish approximately 12 1/2 inches by 14 1/2 inches in size. Then dollop the potato mash on top, spreading with a spatula, taking care to seal the edges to prevent the meat below from bubbling up in the oven. Use a fork to draw lines over the top, then dot with butter and sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. If you&#39;re cooking this straight away, in other words when everything&#39;s still warm, about 10 minutes in a 425 degree F oven should be enough to make it piping hot and golden and crisp on top. If cooking from cold, about an hour in a 375 degree F oven should do it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barolo]&quot; 2761,&quot;Chow Mein 8 ounces thin lo mein noodles 1 tablespoon peanut oil<br> 1 carrot, julienned<br> 1/2 head napa cabbage, sliced thin<br> 1/2 onion, sliced<br> 1/4 cup chicken broth<br> 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce<br> 1 teaspoon sesame oil<br> Sliced green onions, for topping Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package directions.

Add the garlic and the crushed red pepper and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool. In a large bowl combine the meats, eggs, Parmigiano, parsley and bread crumbs. It works well to squish the mixture with your hands. Add the onion mixture and season generously with salt and squish some more. Add the water and do 1 final really good squish. The mixture should be quite wet. Test the seasoning of the mix by making a mini hamburger size patty and cooking it. The mixture should taste really good! If it doesn&#39;t it is probably missing salt. Add more. Add more anyway. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Shape the meat into desired size. Some people like &#39;em big some people like &#39;em small. I prefer meatballs slightly larger than a golf ball. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to a medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs on all sides. Place them on a cookie sheet and bake them in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. If using right away, add them to your big pot of marinara sauce. If not using right away, they can be frozen for later use. Serve with pasta and sauce or just eat them straight out of the pot! YUM! Coat a large saucepot with olive oil and add the pancetta. Bring the pot to a medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, season generously with salt and stir to coat with olive oil. Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes stirring frequently. The onions should become very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes stirring frequently. Pass the tomatoes through the food mill. Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds, and be sure to scrape the pulp off of the bottom of the food mill. That&#39;s all of the big money stuff! Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out 1 of the empty tomato cans with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and TASTE IT!!!! Tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally and tasting frequently. Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need. This sauce can also be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for a few days and freezes really well.

Add the chicken thighs, seal the bag and shake to evenly disperse. Refrigerate and let marinate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. When ready to fry, remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry. (Discard the marinade.) Fill a large, wide Dutch oven or pot with about 2 1/2 inches of oil, then add the shortening. Attach a deep-frying thermometer to the side of the pot and bring to 350 degrees F over medium heat. Line a large baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. Whisk together the flour, paprika, mustard, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Pour in 1/4 cup of buttermilk and use your fingers to work it in, making the flour shaggy. Whisk the remaining cup of buttermilk and 1 tablespoon hot sauce together in another large bowl. Dip one of the chicken thighs in the buttermilk mixture and let the excess drip off. Add to the flour mixture, making sure to press the chicken into the flour to fully coat. Set on a plate. Repeat with as many chicken thighs as your pot can hold comfortably in one batch. (As the chicken sits, if you notice it getting soggy in any spots, then dredge it in the flour mixture again.) Once the oil is at 350 F, being careful of the hot oil, slide the breaded chicken into the oil, turn off the heat and allow the temperature to drop all the way to 300 degrees F. When the temperature reaches 300 degrees F, turn the heat back on low and continue to fry, turning the chicken as needed for even browning, while adjusting the heat to maintain a temperature around 300 degrees F. Fry until the chicken is a deep golden brown with an internal temperature of about 170 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Remove to the lined baking sheet and sprinkle with a little salt. If you&#39;re working in batches, dredge the remaining chicken and increase the heat to 350 degrees F again and repeat the process. Once all the chicken is fried, split the buns and toast in a toaster oven or broiler, cut-side up, until golden.

Prepare lamb for roasting. Place any trimmed-off bones in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place the meat, fat-side up, on top of the bones. Season with salt, pepper and thyme. Place in hot oven and roast to desired doneness. Rack of lamb is usually roasted rare or medium. Test doneness with a meat thermometer or by the touch method as for steaks. Total time will be about 30 minutes. Remove the lamb from the roasting pan and hold in a warm place. Leave bones in the pan. Set the roasting pan over moderate heat to caramelize the juices and clarify the fat. Pour off the fat. Add the garlic to the pan and cook 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the stock and reduce by half. Strain, degrease, and season, to taste. Cut the meat between the ribs into chops. Serve 2 chops per portion with 1 ounce of juice.

Using a rubber spatula, mix until they are coated evenly. The chocolate will immediately begin to set. Once the chocolate has set, repeat with the remaining chocolate to give it second coat. Quickly scoop the chocolate corn flakes into small mounds onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. (It is easier to use one spoon to scoop the mounds and another spoon to scrape them onto the sheet pan.) It is important to work quickly because the mixture is easier to scoop before the chocolate hardens. If your kitchen is very hot, you can place the sheet pan in the refrigerator for about 5 minutes to allow the chocolate to harden, however, do not leave them in the refrigerator for more than 10 minutes. If they get too cold, condensation will form on them when they are removed from the refrigerator due to the difference in temperature between the cold chocolate and the warm air, which will cause the chocolate to turn white. While this doesn&#39;t affect the taste, it does ruin the appearance. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry area for up to 2 weeks. How to Temper Chocolate (From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Reds, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 2808,&quot;Yorkshire Puddings 2 tablespoons beef drippings<br> 6 ounces all-purpose flour<br> 6 ounces milk (whole or semi-skimmed) 4 ounces water 2 free-range eggs<br> Salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Keep the rub in an airtight container for up to 6 months. For the ribs: Rinse and dry the ribs. Put them on a clean cutting board and pull off the thin fatty skin that lines the underside of the ribs. Trim the ribs of all excess fat. Reserve 2 tablespoons peach rub (1 for ribs and 1 for sauce), then liberally sprinkle each side with the remaining rub and wrap the ribs in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours so the flavors can permeate the meat. Fill a grill with the chips and briquettes and preheat them to 250 degrees F. Put the ribs, meatier-side down, over indirect heat and cook for 3 hours with the grill cover down. Turn the slabs and cook until the ribs bend easily, about 1 hour. At this point, remove them from the grill. Sprinkle the slabs with 1 tablespoon reserved peach rub and slice it into portions. Cut each slab into individual ribs and coat with Gina&#39;s Peach BBQ Sauce. Arrange on a serving platter and serve. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Grease the tins and set aside. In a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, melt the butter and chocolate together, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl whisk together the eggs, yolks, and sugar. Whisk the egg mixture into chocolate mixture; then whisk in the flour. Fill the tins with the batter and bake for 4 to 5 minutes. (Alternatively, refrigerate the cakes until ready to bake, up to a day in advance. If baking cold, do so for 5 to 6 minutes.) Paint the bottoms of several shallow soup plates with the chocolate bergamont paint. Immediately unmold the cakes onto the plates. Place a pinch of cocoa nibs beside each cake (as a small stand for the ice cream), and place a scoop of star anise ice cream on top of each. Drizzle the citrus reduction around each plate and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa powder. 4 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 1/3 cup brewed tea (recommended: Earl Grey) 1/4 cup light corn syrup In the top half of a double boiler, combine the 2 chocolates over simmering water. Stir constantly until melted; then whisk in the tea and syrup, without removing the double boiler from the heat. Whisk until smooth and shiny. If the sauce is too thick, thin it with a touch of hot water. Using a brush, paint the sauce onto plate before serving. (The sauce can be made up to 48 hours in advance and refrigerated. To rewarm, stir over low heat or heat in a microwave.) Yield: approximately 1 1/4 cups 2 cups half-and-half 2 cups heavy cream 1 heaping tablespoon star anise pieces 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 1 cinnamon stick 9 egg yolks 3/4 cup sugar In a saucepan over medium heat, heat the half-and-half, cream, star anise, ground cinnamon, vanilla, and cinnamon stick, whisking occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat and let the flavors infuse for 10 minutes. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. In a thin stream, whisk half of the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Then pour the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan containing the rest of the cream mixture. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Meanwhile, put 2 handfuls of ice cubes in a large bowl, and add enough cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Pour the cream mixture through a fine sieve into the smaller bowl, to remove the vanilla bean pieces and cinnamon sticks. Chill 3 hours; then freeze in an ice cream freezer according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions Yield: 1 quart 1/2 cup orange juice 1/2 cup grapefruit juice 1/4 cup lemon juice 1/4 cup corn syrup Place all the ingredients in a saucepan and simmer on low until reduced to a thick syrup.

Let it cool, then add the vinegar, calamansi juice, garlic and cl peppers. Taste test and adjust the dipping sauce to your liking. (You can prepare the sauce in advance. Extra sauce can be stored in the fridge for up three months.) For the cha-gio: Boil the mushrooms in water for 2 minutes, then drain. Chop 1/2-inch large and set aside. Submerge glass noodles in a large bowl of hot water. Let soften 10 minutes, then drain and cut into 1-inch lengths. In wok or medium deep pot (no oil, ground pork has plenty of pork fat), combine ground pork, taro root and wood-ear mushroom. Cook, mixing on low heat until pork and taro are well done. Turn off heat, then combine with carrots, cabbage, glass noodles, onions, fish sauce, sugar and pepper. Separate wrappers into individual sheets by pulling them apart slowly to prevent tearing. There will be one side of the sheet with a hard edge (the side that connects all wrappers together). Tear or cut off that hard edge so that all sides are the same thickness. Use about 1 full tablespoon filling for each roll, and fold top over, then the right side, then left, and fold down to end. Dab a little egg to seal the roll. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers. In a wok or deep skillet, heat vegetable oil to 325 degrees F. Fry in small batches until rolls are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

Cook the pasta, boiling salted water until just tender, drain and refresh in ice water. Put a thin layer of bechamel in the bottom of a shallow baking dish or a jelly-roll pan. Cover the bechamel with a thin layer of ragu and a little cheese. Top the sauces and cheese with a layer of lasagna noodles. Repeat 6 times ending with a layer of bechamel, ragu and cheese. Bake the lasagne until it is warm at the center and the cheese topping golden brown, about 45 minutes (cover with some aluminum foil if the lasagna browns before it is fully heated). Mix the eggs, salt, and olive oil with 2 tablespoons of water in a mixer using the paddle attachment. Add the flour and mix until the dough comes together then knead the dough using the dough hook until it is smooth and elastic. (Alternatively combine the flour with the salt and mound in a large bowl or on a clean work surface. Make a well in the center of the flour mound. Combine the wet ingredients in the well then gradually incorporate the flour. When the dough comes together, knead it until it is smooth and elastic.) Divide the dough in thirds. Roll each sheet of dough through the machine starting at the widest setting then graduating to thinner settings and stopping when the sheets of dough are a medium thickness. Place the sheets of pasta on a lightly floured surface and set aside until ready to use. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook until the mixture is creamy and no longer smells floury. Set the flour mixture (a roux) aside and rinse the pan. Place the milk in the saucepan, add the grated nutmeg and bring to boil over medium-high. Whisk the flour mixture into the milk. Whisk constantly as the sauce returns to a boil and simmer until the sauce thickens sufficiently to coat the back of a spoon. Season the bechamel with salt and reserve it in a water bath until ready to use. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium in a large pot. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the veal and brown, breaking up any big chunks of meat. Add the wine, increase the heat and simmer until the pan is once again dry, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and enough water to cover. Bring the sauce to a simmer then reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is deeply flavored and no longer watery, about 4 hours.

Using a second knife, slice the squid across into 1/4-inch slices, as if you&#39;re cutting it into rings. You won&#39;t be able to cut all the way because of the other knife.<br> Light your barbecue or preheat a griddle pan to hot. Preheat your oven to maximum.<br> Parboil the baby leeks for 3 minutes in a pan of boiling salted water, drain in a colander and let them steam dry. Dress them with some olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the leeks on the barbecue or in the griddle pan on both sides until nicely marked, then add the fennel wedges and chargrill these dry on both sides until they are also marked. Add the radicchio leaves and dry grill these on both sides to wilt them - 30 seconds on each side should do. Put the leeks, fennel and radicchio into a large bowl - they might look a bit sad, but don&#39;t worry because you&#39;re going to pep them up! For the chorizo dressing: Heat a frying pan with a couple of glugs of olive oil. Fry the chorizo until the fat renders out, add the rosemary and garlic, toss and take off the heat after 30 seconds. Add the balsamic vinegar and half the lemon juice to the pan, mix and put to 1 side.<br> Drizzle some olive oil over each squid, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss well. Preheat an ovenproof pan on the stove top, pour in some olive oil and toss the reserved tentacles in the oil for 1 minute. Add all 4 squid and whack the pan in the preheated oven for a few minutes or until cooked and lightly browned.<br> Pour the chorizo dressing over your chargrilled veggies and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Take the squid out of the oven. Serve each of your guests a nice pile of the dressed veggies, a concertina squid, some tentacles and half a lemon. Sprinkle over some of the reserved herby fennel tops and tuck in! \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Beat the butter, granulated sugar and molasses in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Working in two batches, beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Divide the dough between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap, flatten each into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats; set aside. Roll out one disk of dough on a lightly floured surface until about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out rounds using a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter. Arrange 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets; cut a round out of the center of each using a 1 3/4-inch cookie cutter. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Gather the scraps and cut-out centers and refrigerate until firm; reroll to cut out more cookies.<br> Bake the cookies, switching the pans halfway through, until just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, finely crush the candies in small batches in a resealable plastic bag. Remove the cookies from the oven and fill the centers of two-thirds of the cookies (about 12) with some of the crushed candies. Return all of the cookies to the oven and bake until lightly browned around the edges and the candies are bubbling, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool 10 to 15 minutes on the pans, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining disk of dough and candies. You should have about 24 candy-filled cookies and about 12 empty cookies; you&#39;ll need 2 candy-filled cookies and 1 empty cookie to assemble each snow globe.<br> Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Beat in the water with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft glossy peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. (The icing should be pipeable but not runny.) Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface until ready to use.<br> Assemble the cookies: Transfer the icing to a resealable plastic bag and snip a corner. Lay out 12 candy-filled cookies upside down. Pipe icing around the edges (don&#39;t get too close to the candy). Top each with an empty cookie; fill the cavities about halfway with sprinkles. Pipe icing around the edge of the empty cookies and set the remaining candy-filled cookies on top to create 12 snow globes. Let set 10 to 15 minutes. Pipe the remaining icing on the top of each cookie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2833,&quot;Sesame-Ginger Pork with Soba Noodles 8 ounces soba noodles or whole-wheat spaghetti 4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided 1 tablespoon minced pickled ginger 1 (1 1/4-pound) pork tenderloin, cut into 1-inch chunks 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 scallions (green and white parts), chopped 1 tablespoon sesame seeds 1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce 1/2 cup sliced water chestnuts, drained 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Cook the soba noodles according to the package directions.

Set aside for 30 minutes to drain. With your hands squeeze juices from cucumber. Combine cucumber in a mixing bowl with remaining sauce ingredients and season to taste with salt and pepper. Skin salmon fillets and remove bones. Fill a wide saucepan with water, about 3 inches deep. For one quart of water, add 2 teaspoons salt and 3 tablespoons vinegar; adjust proportions accordingly for more or less water. Bring to a boil. Carefully add salmon to pan and adjust heat until water is just below simmering -- it should shiver, and not quite bubble. Cook until fish has turned from translucent to opaque and feels springy to touch, about 8 minutes. Remove salmon with a spatula and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Transfer to serving platter, garnish with sauce and decorate with dill sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2838,&quot;Bangers and Mash 2 pounds potatoes 8 links Cumberland sausage (Italian sausage may substitute) 1 tablespoon oil 1 large onion 2 tablespoons flour 4 cups chicken stock 4 tablespoons cream 2 ounces butter 2 tablespoons creme fraiche 2 tablespoons grainy mustard, plus mustard for dipping Salt and pepper Instructions: Peel and dice potatoes. Place in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, add salt and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prick sausages with a fork, heat a skillet and brown the sausage in 1 tablespoon oil. Slice the onion. Remove the sausage to a plate and add the onion to the pan. Cook onions until soft, then add 2 tablespoons flour, cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken stock and return the sausage to the pan, cooking it through for about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and run them through a food mill into a saucepan.

Drain and rinse the casings, then run water through the insides. Return the casings to the bowl, cover with cold water and refrigerate until ready to use. Toss the pork shoulder, pork belly, garlic, brown sugar and 3 tablespoons each salt and pepper in a large bowl. Spread out on a baking sheet and freeze until cold but not frozen, 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil and annatto seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat until the oil bubbles around the seeds, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Mix the soy sauce and vinegar in a separate bowl and refrigerate until ready to use. About 30 minutes before making the sausage, chill all parts of the meat grinder attachment of a stand mixer in the freezer. Fit the grinder with a coarse-grind die. Set a large bowl in a larger bowl of ice and position under the grinder. Feed the pork mixture through the grinder on the second lowest speed into the bowl.<br> Transfer half of the ground meat to the stand mixer bowl. Beat with the paddle attachment on low speed, slowly adding half of the annatto oil and half of the soy sauce mixture, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a separate bowl. Repeat with the remaining ground meat, annatto oil and soy sauce mixture; combine all the sausage in one bowl, cover and refrigerate at least 5 hours.<br> Set up a sausage stuffer attachment with a large tube. Lightly coat the tube with vegetable oil and slide a casing over it until 4 inches are left at the end; tie in a knot. Fill the sausages (see directions at right for coils and links). Prick holes in the sausages every inch with a sterilized needle and refrigerate until ready to grill.<br> About 30 minutes before grilling, let the sausages sit at room temperature. Preheat a grill to medium and prepare for indirect cooking: On a gas grill, turn off half the burners; on a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side. Once the grill registers 325? F to 350? F, lightly brush the sausages with vegetable oil and place on the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat). Cook, covered, flipping once, 20 minutes. Move the sausages to direct heat and cook, flipping often and moving the sausages around to prevent flare-ups, until browned and a thermometer inserted into the centers registers 155? F, 10 to 30 more minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.<br> To Make Coiled Sausages: Put half of the ground sausage mixture in a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice, then start filling the stuffer, packing in the meat to prevent air pockets. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed and start stuffing the first casing, adding more of the meat mixture when the compartment is about half empty. If air pockets form, pop the casing with a sterilized needle, then gently squeeze the filling to fill any voids. Do not overfill the casing \\u2014 it should be able to bend and flex. Once the first casing is full, slide it off the stuffer tube and tie a knot to seal; trim off any excess casing. Repeat to make another long sausage. Coil each sausage into a spiral and skewer each with 2 long metal skewers in an X. To Make Sausage Links: Follow the directions above for filling the sausages, but use only one-quarter of the ground sausage mixture per casing. Repeat to make 4 long sausages (do not coil). Separate the sausages into links by pinching the sausage every 4 inches; twist the casings in opposite directions to make links. Tie with kitchen twine, if desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 2840,&quot;Mozzarella Waffle Bites with Peach Salsa Farm Rich?

Pat the turkey dry inside and out with paper towels. Combine the salt and baking powder in a small bowl. Sprinkle the salt mixture inside the turkey cavity lightly, then sprinkle liberally all over the outside. (The turkey should be well coated but not fully encrusted.) Discard any excess. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 24 hours. When ready to roast, let the turkey come to room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat with the poultry seasoning and garlic. Cook on low for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and let cool completely. Discard the garlic. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Set the turkey on a rack set in a stovetop-safe roasting pan. Add the thyme, rosemary, sage, lemons and orange to the cavity. Tie the legs with butcher&#39;s twine and fold back the wings for even cooking. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the infused herb oil, then brush the turkey all over with the remaining oil. Roast the turkey 30 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Continue to roast, basting occasionally with the reserved oil after 1 hour and spinning the roasting pan halfway through, until the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165 degrees F, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours more. In the last 30 minutes, baste with the pan drippings. Let the turkey rest for 30 minutes before carving. For the gravy: Set the roasting pan over medium-high heat and bring the drippings to a boil. Sprinkle over the flour, whisking constantly. Continue to whisk the flour while it cooks for 2 to 3 minutes, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Slowly add the chicken stock, stirring constantly, until the gravy is thick and light brown.

Line a 9 by 9 square baking pan with parchment paper, making sure paper hangs over the edges. Grease paper with butter so the brownies don&#39;t stick. Melt butter and chocolate over a double-boiler and stir gently until smooth and shiny. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt into a mixing bowl and set aside. Whisk together eggs, sugar and amaretto in a mixing bowl until combined. Pour in chocolate mixture and continue to whisk until combined. Gradually add flour mixture, then add walnuts and incorporate with a wooden spoon.

Pour the oil into a metal roasting pan and put it in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes to heat up the pan and condition it with the oil. Spread the bones out on the roasting pan and cook until browned, 30 to 45 minutes, turning the bones occasionally so they brown evenly. Transfer the bones to a large-enough stockpot to accommodate the bones, 6 quarts ice water and more. Use tongs to transfer the bones so you do not pour any fat into the stockpot. Add the ice water to the stockpot and bring to a simmer. Allow the stock to cook for 4 hours at a slow simmer. Skim the surface of the stock occasionally to remove any fat or impurities. While the stock is simmering, discard all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the roasting pan. Bring the pan back up to temperature over high heat on the stovetop. Add the onions and carrots and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Add the celery and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf and cook, stirring regularly, until the tomato paste gets a brick red color, about 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the red wine and stir it into the mirepoix (vegetable) mixture. Add the mirepoix mixture to the stock after the 4-hour simmering time. Bring the stock back up to a simmer and continue to cook it for another 2 hours. In a separate pot, bring the remaining 7 cups red wine to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. When the stock has simmered for 6 hours, strain it through a chinois and combine the strained stock with the reduced red wine. Bring the stock to a boil, lower the heat to a hard simmer and reduce the stock until it has a consistency that coats the back of spoon and is about 2 quarts (8 cups) in volume, up to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper and then strain the sauce though a chinois again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2913,&quot;Spicy Beef Tamales 4 ears fresh un-husked corn 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 onion sliced 1 1/2 pounds ground beef 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste 2 teaspoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon celery salt Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup yellow cornmeal 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups water, divided 4 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced (use gloves when handling) 1/2 cup Monterey Jack cheese Instructions: Husk corn, discarding the silk. Place corn husks in a large pot and pour boiling water over them, and allow to soak for 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry, leaving moist but not wet. Cut the kernels from the corn to equal about 1 1/2 cups. Of this amount, puree 1 cup of the kernels in a food processor and leave the other kernels whole. Set aside. Heat olive oil and saute onion until translucent. Add ground beef, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, celery salt, and salt and pepper, and cook until browned. Drain off extra fat and divide into even amounts per the number of tamales you will be making. Combine cornmeal, salt, and 1 cup water in a mixing bowl. Bring another 1 cup of water to a boil and stir in cornmeal mixture, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat and whisk in butter, baking powder, pureed corn, whole corn kernels, and jalapeno. The tamales are eaten directly from the corn husk casings in which they are steamed. To make tamale casings for steaming: Tear corn husks into strips. Some of these will be woven together and should be at least an inch wide. You will also need about 16 narrower strips (1/4 to 1/2 inch wide) to secure the ends of the tamales. Lay 4 strips or so side by side, and then weave another 4 or so through in a perpendicular fashion to make 8 rectangles about 8 inches square. Each tamale will be filled with even amounts of the corn mixture, beef mixture and cheese. Spoon some of the corn mixture (between 2 and 4 tablespoons) into the center of each tamale case and spread to make a layer. Then spoon an even amount of the ground beef mixture into the center of corn mixture on each tamale. Top beef mixture with even amounts of cheese on each tamale. At this point, begin 1 or 2 pans of boiling water, each fitted with a steaming rack (You will need enough steaming space over the pans to accommodate the tamales.) Fold the corn husks so the corn filling encases the meat filling and cheese. Secure the ends of the tamales casings by tying shut with pieces of corn husk. Place tamales on racks and steam - covered - for about 20 minutes to a half hour, replenishing water in pan(s) as needed. Let rest briefly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2914,&quot;Eggs in Tomatoes 6 slices rustic bread 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing and drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> One 10-ounce container mushrooms, sliced<br> 1 green bell pepper, sliced 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced Red pepper flakes, as needed One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 6 large eggs<br> Instructions: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.

Spray 3 soup spoons lightly with cooking spray. Place 3 unwrapped candy canes on the prepared baking sheet and bake until the candy canes are slightly soft and pliable and very warm to the touch, 8 to 10 minutes. Gently lift a candy cane and place onto one of the greased spoons (if they&#39;re too hot to touch, lift with a paper towel.) Mold and gently press the curved top of the candy cane into the bowl of the spoon so that it takes the shape of the spoon; the center of the bowl will be bare. Mold the straight part of the candy cane to the handle of the spoon. If the candy canes cool too quickly, you can pop them back in the oven for a minute or two to soften again. Let cool on the spoons while you bake the next batch of candy canes, continuing until you&#39;ve molded them all. Melt the 3 chocolates in 3 separate small bowls by microwaving each on 50 percent power in 20-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted. Dip the bowls of the candy cane spoons into the melted chocolate; you will have 4 of each type of chocolate. Set the spoons so that the chocolate-covered bowls sit flat on the cooled baking sheet and the handles tilt upward resting on the baking sheet rim. Let the chocolate set slightly, 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature or 5 minutes in the refrigerator. Keep the remaining chocolate in the bowls warm and melted, returning them to the microwave if necessary. Spoon some melted chocolate into the open unfilled space in the bowls of the spoons. Sprinkle with marshmallows, chocolate chips or crushed candy canes, mounding them in the center so they look like they&#39;re on the spoon. Let harden completely at room temperature, about 1 hour, or in the refrigerator, 15 to 20 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 2925,&quot;The New Queso 8 Anaheim chiles 4 jalapenos 8 ounces bacon, finely diced<br> 8 ounces chorizo, crumbled<br> 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 large onion, diced<br> One 28-ounce can diced tomatoes and green chiles, such as Rotel<br> 2 pounds processed cheese, such as Velveeta, cubed<br> 8 ounces pepper jack cheese, shredded Two 12-ounce cans evaporated milk<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro<br> Tortilla chips, for serving<br> Instructions: To roast the Anaheim chiles and jalapenos: Roast the chiles by using metal tongs to hold them one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop until the skin is totally charred. (If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven&#39;s broiler.) When totally blackened, place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow them to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Then use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Stem, seed and dice the chiles. In large pot over medium heat, add the bacon and chorizo. Cook until the fat has been rendered out, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and onion to a food processor and pulse until almost a paste. Drain off most of the fat from the bacon and chorizo, then add the garlic-onion puree to the pot and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the diced tomatoes and green chiles into the food processor and pulse slightly. Add to the pot, juice and all. Fold in the reserved diced chiles. Cook for 4 minutes. Slowly whisk in both cheeses and the evaporated milk. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to heat through, making sure to not scorch the bottom of the pot.

For the cupcakes: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, honey and 6 tablespoons of the lavender sugar. Add in the eggs and lemon oil and mix until smooth. In a bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, sea salt and the 1 tablespoon reserved ground lavender. With the mixer on low speed, slowly incorporate half of the flour mixture. Next mix in the lemon juice. (The mixture may look curdled but it is not.) Mix in the remaining flour mixture and then the milk and lemon zest. Continue mixing until the batter is totally smooth. Double line 1 1/2 standard, nonstick cupcake tins with liners. Fill the liners with a heaping 1/4 cup of the batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool until easy to handle. While still slightly warm, dip the tops of the cupcakes in another 6 tablespoons lavender sugar. Place on baking sheet and let cool completely. For the lemon frosting: Melt the white chocolate over a double-boiler. Allow to cool slightly but don&#39;t let the chocolate set. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip together the cream cheese, butter, lemon oil and sea salt. Slowly add in the melted white chocolate and mix until smooth. Spoon the frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip and refrigerate until set. Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes and garnish with the edible flowers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 2927,&quot;Beef and Chorizo Stuffed Burgers with Caramelized Onions 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large yellow onion, sliced Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds 90/10 ground beef 8 ounces fresh chorizo 1 cup shredded Monterrey Jack cheese Olive oil 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 4 potato burger buns Condiments of your choice 1/2 cup picked cilantro, to serve Instructions: Set up your grill for indirect heat.

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a large bowl. Add the milk, shortening, eggs, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, the salt and 7 cups flour; mix with a wooden spoon until combined. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Lightly oil 2 baking sheets. Combine the cinnamon and the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a small bowl. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-by-24-inch rectangle, with a long side facing you. Spread the butter over the right half of the rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges; sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. Fold the left half of the dough over the cinnamon sugar, like closing a book. Cut the folded dough crosswise into twelve 1-inch-wide strips. Take one strip and twist several times, stretching the dough a little; hold one end of the strip against a baking sheet and wind the strip around to form a coil, tucking the other end underneath. Repeat with the remaining strips, spacing the rolls about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Lightly cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Uncover the rolls and bake until lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.

Mix all of the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl. Put the turkey on a rack in a roasting pan. Generously season the turkey cavity with salt and pepper, to taste. Brush the turkey with olive oil, and rub it with the seasoning mixture. Tie the legs together loosely to hold their shape, and tuck the wing tips under. Roast the turkey until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh registers 165 to 170 degrees F, about 3 hours. Transfer the turkey to a platter. Tent it very loosely with foil, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes (the internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees). Reserve the juices in the pan.

Place the shanks in a large baking dish, drizzle with the lemon juice, turning to coat, and season with salt and pepper on all sides. Mix the parsley, thyme and marjoram in a small bowl, then rub the herbs over the lamb. Cover and set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. After 30 minutes, place a Dutch oven or covered ovenproof pot in the oven and preheat to 500 degrees for at least 30 minutes. Transfer the shanks to a plate and drizzle with the melted butter; reserve the marinade. Carefully remove the preheated pot from the oven. Working quickly, add the shanks, making sure at least one side of each touches the hot pot. Return the pot to the oven, uncovered, and place the lid on another oven rack to keep it hot. Roast the shanks for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the reserved marinade and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour the hot marinade over the shanks, then place a large sheet of heavy-duty foil over the pot and cover with the hot lid. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and roast 45 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 200 degrees and cook 30 more minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the lamb inside, undisturbed, to finish cooking, 20 minutes. Remove the lamb from the cooking liquid and place in a shallow baking dish. Refrigerate the meat and the sauce separately overnight. When ready to serve, position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Drizzle the shallots with olive oil in a small baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Cover the lamb loosely with foil. Bake the lamb and shallots for 25 to 30 minutes, uncovering the lamb and brushing lightly with melted butter after 15 minutes. Meanwhile, discard the fat from the chilled sauce and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Drizzle the finished lamb and shallots with the sauce and garnish with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 2939,&quot;Squid Ink Pasta with Calamari and Chorizo 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 ounce ground fresh chorizo<br> 1 ounce red onion, thinly sliced 4 cloves garlic, sliced 2 ounces dry white wine<br> Kosher salt 2 portions Fresh Squid Ink Pasta, about 8 ounces each, recipe follows 4 ounces calamari rings and tentacles (4 squid)<br> 1 pinch red pepper flakes<br> 1 tablespoon sliced scallions (on the bias)<br> 10 ounces (about 2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 whole large eggs (about 4 ounces) 4 yolks from 4 large eggs (about 2 1/2 ounces) 4 teaspoons squid ink 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Heat the oil in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until well browned, breaking up the sausage as it cooks with a wooden spoon. Add the onions and garlic and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the white wine and continue cooking about 30 seconds; the mixture should not be dry. Turn off the heat and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook about 1 minute. Turn the chorizo mixture back on. Add the calamari and red pepper flakes and saute until just cooked through. Drain the pasta and add to the pan along with 1 ounce of the pasta water. Cook for 1 minute on high heat to coat the pasta and finish the cooking process. Add the scallions and toss. Place in a bowl and finish with another drizzle of oil and serve. For the squid ink pasta dough: On a large, clean work surface, pour the flour in a mound. Make a well in the center about 4 inches wide. Pour the whole eggs, egg yolks, squid ink and salt into the well and, using a fork, beat thoroughly. When combined, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a wet, sticky dough has formed. Fold any additional flour into the dough as needed while kneading, turning the dough roughly 45 degrees each time, for 2 to 5 minutes. Wrap the ball of dough tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest on the countertop for 30 minutes. To roll the noodles: Place a sheet of parchment paper on a tray or cutting board and dust lightly with flour. Unwrap the rested dough and cut into quarters. Set one quarter on the work surface and re-wrap the remaining dough. With a rolling pin, flatten the quarter of dough into an oblong shape about 1/2-inch thick. Set a pasta maker to the widest setting and pass the dough three times through the machine at this setting. Narrow the setting by one notch and repeat. Repeat once more (the dough should now have passed through the third widest setting). Continue passing the dough through the rollers, reducing the thickness by one setting each time, until it reaches the desired thickness. It should now be very delicate and elastic to the touch and slightly translucent. To cut the noodles: Adjust the pasta machine to the noodle setting of your choice. Working with one dough segment at a time, feed the dough through the pasta cutter. Alternatively, cut the folded dough by hand with a chef&#39;s knife to desired noodle width. Yield: 4 servings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2940,&quot;Miso Rice Cereal Cookies 3 1/4 cups rice cereal, such as Rice Krispies 1/4 cup yellow corn flour 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 sticks plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened 3 tablespoons white miso paste 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 large egg, room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons white miso paste 2 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons full-fat sour cream A few drops red or other festive food coloring Instructions: For the cookies: Blend 3 cups of the rice cereal in a blender until it turns to powder, about 25 seconds. Transfer the rice cereal powder to a small bowl and add the corn flour, salt and baking soda; mix to combine. Set aside. Add the butter, miso paste and granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Mix on medium-high speed for 5 full minutes, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula halfway through. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat on high for another 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly add the rice cereal powder-corn flour mixture. Mix until just fully combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Just as you did with the rice cereal mixture, slowly pour the all-purpose flour into the dough. Stir on medium-high speed for 10 seconds. Then, use the spatula to gently fold the dough into itself, making sure to fully incorporate any remaining ingredients. Set aside two 10-by-15-inch (or similar) sheet pans. Layer each pan with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Form 12 balls with the dough about the size of a scoop of ice cream. Arrange 6 per sheet pan and use the back of a 1-cup measure to lightly flatten the tops of each cookie. Refrigerate for 1 hour and up to 24 hours covered with plastic wrap.<br> When you are ready to bake your cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake the cookies for 16 minutes on the middle rack of the oven for even coloring. You will know they are ready when they form slightly crisp, golden edges. Here&#39;s a food stylist&#39;s trick: when you remove the cookies from the oven, you can use a large round metal cookie cutter or a quart container (larger than the size of the cookies) to mold the outside edges of the cookies to give them a perfect round shape. Let the cookies cool to room temperature.<br> For the glaze: Combine the miso paste, 1 1/4 cups of the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1/4 cup of the sour cream and 2 tablespoons cold water in a blender. Mix on high until you get a smooth and glossy glaze. You may need to scrape down the sides of the blender with a spatula to loosen any remaining confectioners&#39; sugar. Pour the icing into a small bowl and mix in the remaining 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar with 2 tablespoons sour cream. Combine until no lumps remain. Set the glaze aside.<br> Now, ice and decorate the cookies. For these cookies, I recommend dividing the glaze into two small bowls and adding a few drops of festive food coloring to one bowl. Not all food dyes are created equal, so make sure to read the package instructions before adding the food dye to your glaze. Lightly drizzle the glaze across the cookies. Then, top each cookie with a sprinkle of the remaining rice cereal. Leave the iced cookies uncovered until the glaze dries, 1 to 2 hours.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 2941,&quot;Slow-Cooker Beef Stew with Carrots and Potatoes 3 sprigs thyme 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper<br> 2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and quartered 3 medium carrots, cut crosswise into thirds 1 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped<br> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 10-ounce can Mexican-style diced tomatoes with green chiles 4 scallions, sliced (optional) Hot sauce, for serving (optional) Instructions: Strip the leaves from 1 sprig thyme and chop; combine with the flour, allspice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper in a large bowl.

Trim excess fat from flank steak and pound to approximately 1/8 - thickness.(This takes a few minutes, but it is important to the recipe. Use a kitchen mallet or a heavy flat weight such as a wine bottle.) Spread stuffing over meat, covering it completely. Lay egg quarters down center, lenghtwise, and roll meat around stuffing without overlapping. Tie with kitchen string at one-inch intervals to hold securely; if any stuffing escapes, carefully push back in. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 cup of the reserved artichoke oil. Heat oil and add stuffed beef roll to hot oil and brown on all sides. Add wine, cover and cook over low heat for 45 minutes.

Set aside. Blend the garlic, salt, pepper, basil, vinegar and oil into a dressing by placing in a covered jar and shaking. Pour it over the ingredients in the bowl, and toss gently. Set aside. Prepare each roll by cutting a shallow plug hole 2-inches in diameter out of the top, then pulling out the soft inside. Make sure you leave some bread on the bottom. The pulled out bread can be saved to make bread crumbs later. Melt butter, add the fresh basil leaves and allow the basil flavors to infuse into the butter. Brush some of the basil butter into the bottom of each roll. Place about 2/3 cup of the filling into each roll, then replace the plug on the top. Use aluminum foil to wrap each sandwich individually.

Place the whole chiles on the grill and cook until well charred and blistered, turning every 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cover with plastic wrap so they \\sweat,\\ making them easier to peel. Let the chiles stand for 5 minutes before uncovering and using towels to rub off the skins. Discard the skins, remove the cores and seeds and finely chop the chiles. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the cheeses and stir together to form a stuffing. Set aside until ready to use.<br> For the turkey cordon bleu: Make a horizontal cut down the length of the thin side of each turkey breast using a sharp thin knife. Open the breasts up like a book so the cut-sides are exposed facing up and the skin-side is down, with the \\spine\\ of the chicken horizontal on your work surface. Sprinkle the turkey with salt and pepper.<br> Lay 5 slices of the deli ham on each breast and trim the edges so the ham fits inside the breast and there is a small border around the turkey. Leaving this gap will ensure that when the turkey is rolled up it forms a nice seal and the stuffing doesn&#39;t ooze out everywhere. Divide the poblano-cheese stuffing in thirds and spread on each of the breasts evenly, leaving a small border around the edge. Starting from one side, tightly roll up the turkey away from you, stuffing in any of the filling as it tries to escape at the edges (it is important you roll it up this way, so when you make the slices in the finished roulade they are across the grain). Secure the roll with pieces of butchers twine every 2 inches to form a tight, even log. Repeat with the remaining breasts. Sprinkle the outsides with salt and pepper.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat oil in a turkey roaster set across two burners on medium-high heat. Add the roulades and brown evenly, 3 to 4 minutes per side. When browned all over, transfer the whole pan of the roulades to the oven and finish cooking. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes.<br> Transfer to a platter and allow the meat to rest to allow for carry-over cooking and the internal temperature to reach 170 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes. To serve, remove the twine and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk just to break up the egg. Add the granulated sugar and mix on medium until it holds stiff peaks. Add the powdered sugar and salt and whisk on medium-high to tighten, about 1 minute. Scrape the bowl down with a spatula and whisk on high for 30 seconds just to make sure it&#39;s even in texture with glossy hard peaks. Put the mixture into a disposable pastry bag and snip off the top inch. Pipe the egg white mixture on the lined sheet trays in six 3- to 4-inch filled-in circles, as if you are putting icing on top of a cupcake. Create a well on each pavlova using the bottom of a spoon, then bake until the pavlovas are hard to the touch, about 2 hours. Allow to cool completely at room temperature on a wire rack before serving. For the lemon curd whipped cream: Meanwhile, put the juice, zest, yolks, granulated sugar and scraped vanilla seeds into a medium pot. Turn the heat on medium-high and cook, constantly stirring with a rubber spatula in a figure 8 motion until it coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Stir in the butter, salt and 1 cup cream until completely combined. Remove from the heat and pour through a fine mesh strainer into a shallow dish. Allow to cool for a minute or two before covering with plastic wrap, touching the curd to prevent a skin from forming. Put the dish in the refrigerator and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Whip the remaining 3 cups cream to medium peaks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Fold the cooled lemon curd into the whipped cream and keep cold until ready to assemble.

Line a baking tray with parchment paper and set an 8 by 2 1/2-inch ring on it, Wrap an 8-inch cardboard round with foil and set aside. In a small bowl, sift together the flour and the baking soda. Set aside. In a double boiler or a metal bowl placed over simmering water, melt the chocolate. Keep warm. Meanwhile with the paddle of an electric mixer, cream the butter until light. Gradually add 1 cup sugar and continue to cream until fluffy. (It is very important that this mixture is light and fluffy.) Beat in the egg yolks, 1 at a time, the whiskey, and the vanilla. Stop the machine and scrape in the melted chocolate. Continue to mix until well combined. Remove the bowl from the machine and fold in half the flour mixture. Fold in the remaining flour. With a clean whisk and bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue to whisk until shiny and firm, but not stiff. Stir 1/4 of the whites into the batter to lighten, then fold in the remaining whites. Pour the batter into the prepared cake ring and bake for 1 hour. Invert immediately onto the foil-covered cardboard round and run a sharp knife around the sides of the cake, loosening the cake from the ring. Do not remove the ring from the cake. Let cool completely on a rack. Then, carefully lift off the ring. Dust the cake with sifted powdered sugar and serve with ice cream or whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Bordeaux Blend, Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 3012,&quot;Thick and Chewy Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Bars Cooking spray 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk 2/3 cup creamy peanut butter 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips (about 12 1/2 ounces) 1/2 cup chopped salted peanuts (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13by-9-inch baking pan with foil, letting the excess hang over the edges of the pan by about 1 inch (this will help you lift the bar easily from the pan in one piece). Spray the pan with cooking spray. Mix the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, whisk the melted butter and sugars until combined. Use a whisk or a rubber spatula to mix in the egg, egg yolk, peanut butter and vanilla until smooth. Fold in the flour mixture until just combined (be careful not to over mix the dough or the bars will be tough). Fold in the chocolate chips and the peanuts. Scrape the dough into the prepared pan, pressing and smoothing the top with a rubber spatula. Bake until the top is slightly golden and firm to the touch and the edges are starting to pull away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack.

Combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan, olive oil, eggs and 1 teaspoon salt with a whisk in a large mixing bowl. Add the all-purpose flour in 3 parts, stirring with a rubber spatula. Bring the dough together in a ball and cut off one-quarter of it. Dust the work surface with all-purpose flour to prevent sticking, and roll the cut-off piece of dough into a dowel shape about 5/8 inch in diameter. Cut the dowel into 5/8-inch pieces. Dust some parchment paper with semolina flour and place the gnocchi on it to prevent sticking. Repeat with the rest of the dough, quarter by quarter. Cook the gnocchi in the boiling water for 2 minutes. Serve tossed with a bit of the Pancetta Tomato Sauce. Alternatively, you can freeze the uncooked gnocchi for up to 2 weeks. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook until the fat has rendered and the pancetta is crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the pancetta from the pan and reserve, leaving the fat behind. Add the diced onions to the hot pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Add the crushed tomatoes, cover and bring to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes, then remove the lid, add the reserved pancetta and cook an additional 10 minutes.

Cook until they are \\fork\\ tender, about 20 minutes. When the potatoes are tender all the way through, remove them from the water and when they are cool enough to handle, but still hot, carefully cut the potatoes in half. Try not to pull the skins off. Chop the garlic and add it along with 2 tablespoons each vinegar and olive oil, and season with salt, to taste. It is important to do this while the potatoes are still warm so they will absorb the vinegar and oil and be seasoned all the way through. While the potatoes are cooking, bring another pot of well-salted water to a boil, over medium heat. Set up a bowl of ice water and season it generously with salt. Add the beans to the boiling water and cook them until they are tender, about 5 to 6 minutes. Bite a bean to be sure they are properly cooked. When the beans are cooked, put them immediately in the bowl of salted ice water to stop the cooking or to \\shock\\ them. When they are cold, remove them from the water and let them dry a little. Cut them in half. In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, beans, olives, oregano and scallions and crushed red pepper. Stir to combine well, taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed. Add the remaining oil and vinegar, if needed. This salad is good now, but will be better if you let it sit for at least 1 hour.

Place the turkey on a rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons salt all over the turkey, inside and out, nudging some into areas where the skin naturally separates from the bird, such as around the neck, top of the breast and between the legs and breast. Chill, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days. Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels, making sure there is no moisture anywhere, especially in the cavity. (Any wetness may cause dangerous splattering.) Place the turkey breast-side up in the basket of a turkey fryer or on the fry stand, depending on the type of deep fryer you have; follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Let the turkey sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 3.<br> Fill a turkey fryer with oil according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, following the specifications for the weight of your turkey (see Cook&#39;s Note). Heat to 375 degrees F (this could take 30 to 60 minutes depending on your fryer). Set a rack inside a rimmed baking sheet.<br> Lowering the turkey requires upper body strength so prepare yourself. Most fryers come with a hook to lower and raise the basket or fry stand in and out of the oil. Make sure to use the hook. Lift the basket over the fryer and carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the oil, inch by inch, until about half way, and then pause to allow the cavity to fill with oil. The oil will be bubbling vigorously and that?s ok. (If it starts to splatter violently, that could mean there is water on the turkey or that the turkey is still partially frozen. If that happens, remove the turkey from the oil and check to ensure the turkey is free of moisture and not still frozen.) Once the cavity is full of oil, continue lowering the turkey until it is completely submerged. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions regarding cooking covered or uncovered and adjusting the heat. Continue cooking until the turkey is golden brown, 3 1/2 to 4 minutes per pound, 40 to 50 minutes.<br> Carefully remove the turkey from the oil and transfer to the prepared rack to drain and cool, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, make the sauce. Boil the maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla bean and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick like molasses, about 10 minutes. Discard the vanilla bean, reduce the heat to low and stir in the butter, one piece at a time, until completely melted, stirring constantly until the glaze is thick and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. Remove the turkey from the basket or fry stand and liberally brush with the glaze, making sure to get into every nook and cranny. Let sit 15 minutes. Repeat basting and sitting two more times. Reserve remaining sauce for serving. Serve with waffles, butter and warm maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3030,&quot;Gina&#39;s Toffee Blondies Nonstick cooking spray 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons salt 2 sticks unsalted butter, softened 1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar 1 cup granulated sugar 3 large eggs 1 tablespoon whole milk 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 1 cup chopped chocolate covered toffee Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and cook at a low boil, 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot and let sit 10 minutes. Strain the sauce. You\\u2019ll need 1/4 cup for this recipe; refrigerate the remainder in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Make the noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Pull the dough into 3 noodles (see below). Throw all the noodles into the water at the same time. Stir with tongs to prevent sticking. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes; remove with tongs and set aside to drain. Cook the cabbage briefly in the noodle water. Strain out and place with the noodles. Meanwhile, in a small cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil over high heat until just shimmering, 1 to 2 minutes. Combine the noodles, cabbage and 1/4 cup noodle sauce in a serving bowl (or do this in a saucepan). Place the chili powder, garlic puree, scallion, celery and chive in a little pile on top of the noodles. Carefully drizzle the hot oil over the pile of aromatics on the noodles, making sure every bit gets sizzled. Stir quickly and serve immediately. Make the Dough: Knead until a dough is formed, 8 to 10 minutes, then remove the dough to a floured board and continue kneading until smooth and springy. Place the flour in a large bowl. Dissolve the salt in the water in a measuring cup. Add the salt water to the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, mixing with your hands.<br> Clean out the bowl, then return the dough to the bowl. Cover with a moist towel and let rest 5 minutes, then knead for a minute or so on a floured board. Repeat this rest-then-knead process twice more. Roll Out the Dough: After the final rest and knead, flatten the dough into a rectangle to the best of your ability. Cut the dough into 3 1/2-ounce pieces (about 6).<br> Use a rolling pin to roll each piece of dough into a flat rectangle, a little over 1/4 inch thick (4 to 5 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide). Rub the dough with vegetable oil and place on a plate (don\\u2019t stack them on top of one another). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, at least 1 hour or up to 3 days. Stretch the Dough: Evenly press and stretch the dough rectangles into flatter rectangles, about 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. Bring the dough to room temperature. Flatten on a clean counter with your hands until the dough feels stretchy and elastic. At this point you should bring your water to a boil. (See recipe above.) Grab the ends of a rectangle with your thumbs and forefingers. Stretch the dough gently until shoulder-width long. Pull and slap the noodle against the counter up and down until the dough is almost 4 feet long.<br> Rip the Noodles: Pick up the noodle in the middle and rip it into two pieces like string cheese. Pull until you almost reach the end, but don\\u2019t pull all the way through. You\\u2019ll end up with a giant noodle ring. Carefully press the ends of the strands to stretch and even them out if they\\u2019re too thick. Pull and rip the remaining noodles. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 3033,&quot;White Pizza Dip One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella<br> 1 cup shredded mild provolone<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 3/4 cup chopped roasted red bell peppers, patted dry<br> Tortilla chips, for serving<br> Crudites, for serving (I used endive spears, carrots, cucumbers, fennel and baby bell peppers)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Combine the garlic and olive oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is lightly golden and crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat; transfer the garlic to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon and season with salt. Reserve the garlic oil. Toss the Brussels sprouts with the reserved garlic oil on a baking sheet and spread in an even layer; season with salt and pepper. Roast until the Brussels sprouts are tender and slightly charred, 30 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the vinegar, brown sugar, honey and bay leaf in the saucepan and whisk until combined. Simmer over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally, until slightly syrupy, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat; let cool until thick and glossy, about 6 minutes. Remove the bay leaf. Transfer the Brussels sprouts to a platter; spoon the vinegar-honey syrup on top and sprinkle with the fried garlic and shaved cheese just before serving.

Cut the racks of ribs in half crosswise. Rub the ribs, paying special attention to the meaty side, with 1/2 cup of the sauce. Lay the rib pieces meat side down in an 11 by 13-inch baking dish. The pieces will overlap slightly. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the meat begins to pull away from the ends of the bones and the ribs are just tender, about 1 hour. You can bake the ribs up to a day before and keep them refrigerated. Bring refrigerated ribs to room temperature about 1 hour before you grill them. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Grill the ribs, brushing them with about half the remaining sauce, until they&#39;re crispy and heated through, about 10 minutes. Move the ribs around as they grill, the sugar in barbecue sauce makes it easy for them to burn. Let the ribs rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting them into 1 or 2-bone pieces. Put out the rest of the sauce for dipping or brush it over the ribs. Stir all ingredients together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 3039,&quot;Marinated Vegetable Salad 1 cup sugar 1 cup red wine vinegar<br> 1/2 cup olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 16 ounces frozen cut green beans, defrosted and drained, or fresh green beans 16 ounces frozen green peas, defrosted and drained, or fresh shelled green peas 1 1/2 cups thinly chopped celery (about 4 stalks)<br> One 2-ounce jar chopped pimientos 2 small sweet onions, thinly sliced<br> 1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and chopped<br> Instructions: Bring the sugar and vinegar to a boil in a medium saucepan.

Not that it is the job of a dessert to be useful: a dessert exists merely to delight. Still, dinner does need to be made, even when there&#39;s precious little time for it, and that should be a delight, too. So here&#39;s the deal: there is pitifully little work to be done to make this berry-dazzler of a tart, and enormous pleasure to be derived from its consumption. All you do is bash a few graham crackers a day or so in advance and make the base - getting one course out of the way early is my way of managing - then stir lemon curd and cream cheese together, and use this cream to line the crumb-covered tart pan. I use store-bought lemon curd here, but even if it comes out of the jar, it must be of good quality. And when it is whipped into the cream cheese, that cream cheese must be at room temperature, as should the lemon curd in its jar. The combination produces a layer of what tastes like cheesecake cream: light, lemony, luscious. I used to put the berries on top of the cream pretty much last-minute, but then I found that a leftover wedge, after the party, looked inviting after being in the refrigerator overnight, and so I now finish assembling the tart ahead of time. But if you prefer to add the fruit nearer to serving, I completely understand. Don&#39;t feel you must obey the fruit orders too literally: any mixture of berries (or indeed other fruit) would do, and you could well use a smaller amount and top the tart less extravagantly. Process the crackers and the butter to a sandy rubble in a food processor and press into the sides and the bottom of a deep-sided fluted tart pan. Put it in the freezer or refrigerator for about 10 to 15 minutes. In a clean processor bowl, process the cream cheese and lemon curd (or just mix by hand) and spread it into the bottom of the chilled tart pan, covering the base evenly. Arrange the fruit gently (so it doesn&#39;t sink in too much) on top of the lemony cream cheese in a decorative manner, leaving some of the strawberries unhulled, with their picturesque stalks attached. Refrigerator the tart, preferably overnight, or for at least 4 hours. It does need to get properly cold in order to set enough for the tart to be unmolded and sliced easily. Make Ahead Note: The tart can be made 1 day ahead. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, being careful not to press on the filling, and refrigerate. Will keep for around 4 days. Freeze Note: The tart, without fruit topping, can be frozen for up to 3 months if made with regular cream cheese, but be warned it may \\weep\\ on thawing, so is not ideal for freezing. Open-freeze tart until firm, then wrap (still in its pan) in a double layer of plastic wrap and layer of aluminum foil. To thaw, unwrap and cover loosely with plastic wrap then thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Decorate and serve as directed in the recipe. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3043,&quot;Bossy Big Sister Pizza One 14-inch pizza dough (store-bought or homemade), stretched and ready for toppings 6 ounces pizza sauce<br> 6 ounces mozzarella, shredded 3 ounces black olives<br> 2 1/2 ounces sliced mushrooms<br> 2 ounces bell peppers, sliced 2 ounces red onion, sliced 5 ounces chopped cooked chicken<br> 3 ounces pepperoni<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/4 ounce minced garlic<br> 1 1/2 ounces black olives<br> 1 1/4 ounces sliced mushrooms<br> 1 ounce red onion, chopped 1 ounce bell peppers, chopped 7 ounces einkorn penne, cooked 3 ounces pizza sauce<br> 2 ounces blue cheese crumbles<br> Instructions: For the pizza: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Remove to bowl and set aside to allow the flavors to blend. Mix all the ingredients for burger patties (do not overwork). Divide the meat into 4 equal patties that are a little larger in diameter than the size of your bun, so that when they shrink after cooking they will fit the buns perfectly. Heat a grill pan, cast iron skillet, or outdoor grill to medium heat. Once the grill is hot, cook burgers about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until desired doneness is reached. Do not overcook or the burgers will be dry. Top each burger with mozzarella cheese during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking. Lightly toast the cut sides of your buns either on the grill or under the oven broiler. Spread some of the feta dressing on the bottom half of each bun, top with a burger patty, romaine lettuce, sliced tomato, red onion, banana pepper rings, and sliced cucumber.

Put the beef in another bowl and season with salt and pepper; use a rubber spatula to mix it in. Flatten 1/4 of the meat mixture in the palm of your hand. Squeeze together about a tablespoon of the cheese and bacon mixture to make a little nugget; put it in the center of the ground beef. Bring up the sides of the patty over the filling, making sure the cheese is completely covered by the meat. Flatten slightly for a nice patty shape. Set them side by side on a platter in the refrigerator while preparing the grill. Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep the burgers from sticking. Grill the burgers for 8 minutes per side for medium. (The USDA recommends cooking ground beef until it is no longer pink and the internal temperature is 160 degrees F.)

Add the mushrooms, shallot and celery, season with salt and pepper and saute until soft and tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, marjoram, oregano and parsley and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool. Fold the crabmeat and bread crumbs into the cooled mushroom mixture and transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the ingredients are finely chopped and fully incorporated, about 30 seconds. Set aside. Heat broiler. Cut a 2-inch horizontal incision in the center of each filet, being careful not to slice the steaks in half, to form a pocket for stuffing. Stuff equal parts of the mushroom dressing into each steak. Pour the coarse pepper onto a flat surface and roll the edges of the steaks on them to coat. Wrap 2 slices of bacon around each steak and fasten them with a toothpick to prevent them from slipping during cooking. Melt the butter in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place the steaks in the skillet and sear until browned, about 1 minute on each side. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and cook until medium-well, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove steaks from skillet and let stand for 5 minutes. Return the skillet to a stovetop burner over medium heat. Place the scallops in the skillet and sear until cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and set aside. To serve, place 2 tablespoons of the Bearnaise Sauce in the center of a round plate. Place a steak in the center of the plate and place 2 more tablespoons of Bearnaise Sauce on top. Place a scallop atop the steak and cover with a Purple Potato Nest. Sprinkle with chives and serve. Combine the tarragon, shallot and vinegar together in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until liquid reduces by 50 percent. Remove from heat and set aside. Whisk the egg yolks together in a double boiler over medium heat until they become pale and double in volume, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all of the butter is incorporated. Strain the liquid from the shallot mixture into the sauce and whisk until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Purple Potato Nest: Heat the oil at 350 degrees F in a fryer or large pot. Use a roto-slicer to cut the potatoes into 4 continuous noodle-like strands. Place the potato strands in the oil, 1 strand at a time and fry until crispy, using a spider to keep the potatoes in a bunch, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.

Using the paddle attachment, start the mixer on low and mix until the dough just comes together, forming a ball. Lube the hook attachment with cooking spray. Attach the hook to the mixer and knead for 15 minutes on medium speed. Tear off a small piece of dough and flatten into a disc. Stretch the dough until thin. Hold it up to the light and look to see if the baker&#39;s windowpane, or taut membrane, has formed. If the dough tears before it forms, knead the dough for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Roll the pizza dough into a smooth ball on the countertop. Place into a stainless steel or glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the bowl and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours. Place the pizza stone or tile onto the bottom of a cold oven and turn the oven to its highest temperature, about 500 degrees F. If the oven has coils on the oven floor, place the tile onto the lowest rack of the oven. Split the pizza dough into 2 equal parts using a knife or a dough scraper. Flatten into a disk onto the countertop and then fold the dough into a ball. Wet hands barely with water and rub them onto the countertop to dampen the surface. Roll the dough on the surface until it tightens. Cover one ball with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the steps with the other piece of dough. If not baking the remaining pizza immediately, spray the inside of a ziptop bag with cooking spray and place the dough ball into the bag. Refrigerate for up to 6 days. Sprinkle the flour onto the peel and place the dough onto the peel. Using your hands, form a lip around the edges of the pizza. Stretch the dough into a round disc, rotating after each stretch. Toss the dough in the air if you dare. Shake the pizza on the peel to be sure that it will slide onto the pizza stone or tile. (Dress and bake the pizza immediately for a crisp crust or rest the dough for 30 minutes if you want a chewy texture.) Brush the rim of the pizza with olive oil. Spread the pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza. Sprinkle the herbs onto the pizza and top with the cheese. Slide the pizza onto the tile and bake for 7 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. Rest for 3 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 3059,&quot;Eclairs 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) butter 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup water 1 cup bread flour<br> 4 extra-large eggs<br> 4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese, softened 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> Seeds from 1 vanilla bean<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> 8 ounces chocolate, chopped or discs 5 tablespoons butter<br> 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon light corn syrup<br> 2 tablespoons cocoa powder<br> 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon light corn syrup<br> 1/4 cup water<br> Instructions: For the choux pastry: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large saucepot over medium-high heat, bring the butter, salt and water to a boil. Using a wooden spoon, add the flour in thirds, stirring it in as fast as possible. Smash any lumps against the side of the pot. Cook the mixture until the dough forms a ball that pulls away from the sides of the pot, about 2 minutes. Add the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer and let it sit and cool for 5 minutes. Beat on low for 1 minute to release steam. Add the eggs, one at a time, until the dough is smooth and pipeable yet still holds its shape. Add the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large tip. Place 4 tiny dabs of dough in the corners of a large baking sheet, then tack down a piece of parchment on top. Pipe the dough into 5-inch lines about 2 inches apart from each other on the prepared baking sheet. Bake, rotating once halfway through, until deep golden brown and dry in the centers, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool. For the whipped cream: In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese with the sugar and vanilla seeds until smooth. Add the heavy cream and continue to beat until medium peaks form. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. For the chocolate glaze: Meanwhile, melt the chocolate over a double boiler. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until completely melted. Whisk together the corn syrup and cocoa powder in a small bowl, then whisk into the chocolate mixture. Set aside until ready to use, but don&#39;t refrigerate. For the poured fondant glaze: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, corn syrup and water in a bowl set over a double boiler. Heat, whisking, until smooth and uniform. Turn the heat off and let sit over the water bath until ready to use. Whisk again right before using. Insert the tip of the pastry bag with the whipped cream into the ends or bottoms of the eclairs to fill them. Dip filled eclairs into the glazes and place on a rack to set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 3060,&quot;The Ultimate Cuban Sandwich 1 pound boneless pork shoulder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, peeled and gently smashed with the side of your knife 1/4 teaspoon dried red chili flakes 1 medium onion, sliced 1 cup fresh orange juice 1 lime, juiced 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 2 bay leaves 1 long Cuban bread roll 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 8 thin slices Swiss cheese 1 cup bread and butter pickles 8 thin slices deli ham Olive oil Instructions: You can do this in a regular Dutch oven, but for convenience and time use a pressure cooker as follows: Begin by braising the pork shoulder. Tie the shoulder in 4 places with kitchen twine so it will hold its shape while being cooked or ask your butcher to do this for you. Season the pork with salt, pepper, cumin and oregano. Set the base of a pressure cooker over low-medium heat and add a 2 count of olive oil. Add garlic and chili flakes and as the oil heats up it will become fragrant and infuse the oil. Add the pork. Add onions around the pork and brown slightly before adding orange juice, lime juice, stock and bay leaves. Secure the lid of the pressure cooker and cook for 20 to 25 minutes depending on the size of your pressure cooker. The pork should be tender when done. When done allow to cool in juices before removing twine and slicing. To prepare Cuban sandwiches, split bread in half then layer the sandwich with mustard, cheese, pickles, ham, pork then cheese again (the cheese glues everything together). Season with salt and pepper in between the ham and pork layers. (Optional: drizzle a little of the pork braising liquid over the meat as well). To cook, heat a large cast iron skillet or grill pan over medium heat and lightly coat with olive oil. Place the sandwiches on the skillet and top with another heavy skillet and a couple of heavy weights (bricks, or cans of tomatoes work well). Press down firmly and cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side until the sandwich has compressed to about a third of its original size and the bread is super-crispy. Serve with beans, rice and plantain chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 3061,&quot;Spinach and Hot Ham Fake-Baked Pasta with a Crispy Top 1 pound cavatappi, corkscrew pasta with lines or, macaroni with line in any short cut Salt 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive, divided 2 tablespoons butter 1 medium onion, chopped 3 cloves garlic, chopped Black pepper 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups whole or 2 percent milk 1/2 pound sliced capocollo, hot ham, halve then slice into thin ribbons 1 box frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and excess liquid squeezed out 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, a few large handfuls, divided 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, ground or freshly grated, eyeball it 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, a couple pinches 1 pound ball fresh mozzarella -- buy a piece wrapped, not packed in water, then cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1 cup plain or Italian bread crumbs A generous handful of flat leaf parsley, finely chopped Instructions: Preheat broiler. Place a large pot of water over high heat and bring to a boil. Add the pasta, salt water and cook to al dente, with a bite. While the water is coming up to a boil for the pasta, heat a medium, deep skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, and the butter. When butter melts into the oil, add onions and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes then dust the onions with flour and continue to cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk. Gently bring milk to a bubble, allow the milk to thicken a bit, then stir in the capocola, spinach and 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano. Season sauce with nutmeg and cayenne and remove from the heat. Taste and add a little salt, if you like. Combine the cooked pasta and the cubed mozzarella with the sauce, stir to coat completely by turning over and over. Transfer dressed pasta to a flameproof baking dish. To make the breadcrumb topping, combine the breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons of EVOO and the remaining 1/2 cup Parmigiano. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the top to cover the pasta from edge to edge. Transfer the baking dish under the broiler and broil until golden brown and crispy. Garnish with chopped parsley. What a gut-buster!

Spray the bottom and sides of three 10-inch round cake pans and three 6-inch round pans; dust with flour, and tap out the excess. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla and orange zest. Transfer the creamed mixture to a very large mixing bowl, then alternate folding the flour mixture and the milk into the batter with a large whisk or spatula, adding the flour in 3 additions and the milk in 2, starting and ending with the flour, just until smooth. Divide the cake batter among 6 different bowls and color each with a different rainbow color using gel food coloring. Add 1 color batter to each of 6 large pastry bags without tips. Add the batter evenly to all the pans by snipping the ends of pastry bags and piping into the center of each pan with 1 color, then repeating with the remaining colors, taking care to always pipe the batter directly into the center of the pan. Bake the cakes, rotating the pans halfway through, until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out mostly clean with some moist crumbs sticking to it, 20 to 30 minutes (the 6-inch cakes will be closer to 20 minutes; the 10-inch cakes will be closer to 30). Cool the cakes in the pans on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove the cakes to the rack to cool completely. For the American buttercream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, vanilla if using, and salt. Whip the mixture on low speed for a while. When the sugar is incorporated, turn the mixer speed up and whip until the buttercream is smooth and looks right to you. It it&#39;s too wet, add a bit more confectioners&#39; sugar. If it&#39;s too stiff, add a bit more butter. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl once or twice to make sure everything is combined. Use immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 24 hours, or in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Rewhip cold buttercream before using it. For the royal icing: Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip most of the confectioners&#39; sugar with the egg whites and lemon juice. Whip until the royal icing holds its shape and is bright white (not translucent), 5 to 8 minutes. If it is too soft, add more confectioners&#39; sugar. If it is too stiff, add a bit of water, drop by drop. Add a few drops of food coloring and keep whipping until you have the shade you want. To store royal icing, scrape it out of the bowl and into a plastic, disposable piping bag, then leave it at room temperature. (Don&#39;t cut the bag until you&#39;re ready to use it, and don&#39;t overfill the bag?you want enough room to tie the back of the bag off to keep the royal icing airtight.) To assemble the cake: Use a serrated knife to level off the tops of any cakes that may have domed during baking. Place a 10-inch cake layer onto a cardboard cake board and spread about 3/4 cup buttercream in an even layer on top. Top with another 10-inch cake layer and repeat until all 10-inch layers are stacked. Use the buttercream to spread a thin even crumb coat on the side and top of the cake. Repeat this process with the 6-inch layers and place both cakes in the fridge so the frosting sets, about 30 minutes. Roll 3 pounds fondant into a circle about 1/4-inch thick. Drape over the top of the 10-inch cake and use a fondant smoother to adhere and smooth the sides and top. Use a paring knife to make a small \\x\\ in the top of the cake to remove any air trapped inside as you smooth the fondant. Use a pizza cutter to trim the excess fondant from the bottom of the cake. Repeat this process with the 6-inch cake using the remaining 2 pounds fondant. Into the center of the 10-inch cake, insert 5 large wide plastic straws straight down through to the bottom (these will support the 6-inch cake on top, so make sure the straws are arranged in a circle no bigger than 6-inches in diameter). Trim the straws with scissors so they are flush with the top of the cake. Stack the 6-inch cake on top of the 10-inch cake. Fit a small round tip onto the pastry bag with the royal icing, then pipe a border along the bottom of both cakes. Adhere dragees in a scattered pattern all over the cake using tiny dots of royal icing. Roll a small piece of fondant and cut as many leaves as you like, then adhere to the cake with a tiny dab of water or royal icing. Sprinkle the entire cake with edible glitter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 3063,&quot;Burrata and Strawberry Bruschetta Fifteen 1/4-inch slices baguette 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon clover honey<br> 1/2 cup quartered cherry tomatoes<br> 3/4 cup chopped strawberries<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil<br> One 8-ounce ball burrata cheese, chilled<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Bring to a simmer over medium low to medium heat; simmer, uncovered, 45 minutes. Add the saffron and simmer 15 more minutes. Strain the stock: Pour the stock through a fine strainer; discard the solids. (If not using immediately, let cool, then cover and refrigerate up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months.) Poach the chicken: Bring 8 cups water, the quartered onion, bay leaf and celery to a simmer in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chicken thighs and gently poach until just tender, about 12 minutes. Shred the meat: Remove the chicken from the pot using tongs and reserve the poaching liquid. Let the chicken cool slightly, then discard the skin and shred the meat. Make the sauce: the tomato paste, ketchup and paprika in a blender. Strain 2 cups of the reserved poaching liquid; add the liquid to the blender and puree until smooth. Finish the chicken: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onion, bell peppers and garlic and cook until translucent, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the pureed sauce and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the shredded chicken and stir to coat with the sauce. Season with salt and keep warm. Make the paella: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a paella pan or large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until the fat renders, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the rice and stir to lightly coat with the oil. Stir in the peas, piquillo peppers, olives, 2 cups chicken mixture and 2 1/4 cups saffron chicken stock. Season with salt. Bake and serve: Cover the paella pan or skillet tightly with foil and bake until the liquid is completely absorbed, 20 to 22 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest, covered, 5 minutes. Serve in the pan.

Then cut through the breast plate to split into two halves. Lay flat in a container large enough to hold four chicken halves with brine. Make the brine by adding the honey, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, lemon juice, 1/2 cup salt and 6 cups water to a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes to allow the flavor and aroma to build. Remove from the heat, add 4 cups ice and stir until the ice has melted and the brine has cooled. Pour the brine over the chicken and refrigerate for 12 hours. Set up a grill for direct and indirect heat. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle both sides generously with BBQ Dry Rub. Grill the chicken, skin-side down, over direct heat until grill marks appear. Flip and continue cooking until grill marks appear on the second side. Move the chicken to indirect heat and cover the grill, or move to a 350-degree oven. Cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with a drizzle of Pimento Chimichurri. Mix together the brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, celery seeds, mustard seeds, coffee, cumin, 2 tablespoons salt and 2 teaspoons pepper in a small bowl.
