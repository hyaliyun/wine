All in all this is a well-crafted, smooth and flavorful wine, with a portion barrel-aged for extra complexity.","designation":"Grand Estates"},{"country":"it","description":"Oak, espresso and toast aromas jump out of the glass.

There's good ripeness and succulence to the wine followed by solid tannins.","designation":"Tre Saggi"},{"country":"us","description":"This 100% Syrah comes from four parcels of high-elevation sites across Sonoma, many of them otherwise single-vineyard designated by the winery. Here, the blending pays off in refined, gamy, sanguine undertones that evolve in the glass to meet mouthfilling black currant, fine-grain leather and white pepper. An acidic lift on the finish balances the wine's power.","designation":"Cuv√©e Christine"},{"country":"us","description":"This estate-grown Riesling brings fresh apples and white peaches to the table. Fresh and concentrated, it hits a generous 13.6% alcohol, with suggestions of sweetness from the quite ripe fruit, although it is technically dry. It seems to have real potential for aging and developing over a decade or more.","designation":"Spruce Goose"},{"country":"us","description":"A robust, softly tannic and powerfully ripe wine showing flavors of cherry pie filling, cola, raisins, red licorice and dusty Asian spices. This dry Bordeaux-style blend contains some Petite Sirah, and is at its best now‚Äì2012.","designation":"Maestro"},{"country":"cl","description":"Feline aromas of nettle and lime lean toward the 90% Sauvignon Blanc in this blend (the rest is Carmen√®re). A flat, mostly lifeless palate is a downer, while pithy, green flavors of lettuce and tarragon finish short.","designation":"Reserva Sauvignon Blanc-Carmen√®re"},{"country":"it","description":"A bright and elegant red wine with a crisp, silky mouthfeel. The bouquet is redolent of wild berry, white almond, chopped mint and spice. This should pair with honey roasted ham or wild turkey.","designation":"Maso delle Rose"},{"country":"us","description":"Charred blue- and black-berry aromas mingle with cola and coffee on the nose. The palate follows suit, adding in a toasted black pepper spice that leads to a mild burnt-bacon finish. Medium bodied with prickling acidity, this toasty, gamy Syrah could sit through 2016 to mellow out.","designation":"Unrestricted"},{"country":"fr","description":"Light in color, in fact almost transparent. The nose is full of tomato, brier and dried herbs. In a word: it's weak. The palate is equally lean and spicy, while the finish seems starched out and on its final legs. On the plus side is a leathery feel and some dried-herb nuances that mingle below the surface.","designation":"Le Parvis"},{"country":"us","description":"Plenty of fresh purple flowers, from violets to lilacs, show on the nose of this bottling, as well as cola spice and a strong core of blueberry fruit. It's lightweight but well structured on the palate, where rose hips, lavender, fennel fronds and tarragon meet with boysenberry and light elderberry. This is still very fresh and young.","designation":"Watch Hill Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Already one of it's most iconic bottlings, this gorgeous 2010 is already a classic. Its complex and intense bouquet unfolds with ripe blackberries, violets, leather, thyme and balsamic herbs.

This wine will age and develop for decades. Drink 2018‚Äì2040.","designation":"Solaia"},{"country":"us","description":"There's too much of everything in this Cabernet. The fruit is massively extracted and sweetly jammy. The oak is a heavy plaster of sweet caramel. The result is impressive for sheer size, but unbalanced. Unlikely to improve with age.","designation":"Hillside"},{"country":"us","description":"The entry is oaky and the fruit light; it seems a bit unbalanced. The fruit suggests pomegranate and very tart raspberry, with plenty of acid; the oak layers in thick flavors of espresso and chocolate. Tannins are stiff but not too rough; and the finish suggests that some American oak mayhave been used.","designation":"Chateau Puryear Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"This reserve-level wine is meant to represent the best barrels of the vintage, coming from grapes grown on both the Schug Estate and Wildcat Vineyard, which makes up the majority at 80%.

The flavors don't entirely meld with the oak showing a bit too prominently, offset by grainy tannins.","designation":"Red Wine Destiny Ridge Vineyards"},{"country":"us","description":"Though the vintage helped create a lighter-than-usual version of this benchmark Pinot, it's beautifully crafted and fully realized. Like Burgundy, it disguises its power in a framework of elegantly defined fruits, acids and polished tannins. Cherry, plum, peach pit, pineapple and lemon oil notes are all in the mix. It's a wine that invites contemplation and rewards your time and attention.","designation":"Bergstr√∂m Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Made in a leaner style, with modest in alcohol, this swaps power for elegance.

There is a flash of lavender at the tip of the sip, and then the darkness descends, with charred meats and blackened berries cut by a strong acidity. It still needs time to develop, but these wines disappear fast, so stock up.","designation":"Watch Hill"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a simple, tart red, crisp in cranberry and red currant fruit and perfumed with spicy oak.

Challenging to be sure, but great wines were made in 2007, and this is one of them.","designation":"La Paul√©e"},{"country":"fr","description":"Despite the initial sharp edge, this does develop into a fresh, fruity style of wine.

Drink now, but with food.","designation":"Triple C"},{"country":"es","description":"Clean, fresh and full of bright cherry and strawberry aromas. Offers the right size and balance, with red plum and red berry flavors touched up by light oak. Mildy toasty and textured on the finish.","designation":"Serres Tempranillo"},{"country":"it","description":"The 4th edition of MunJebel (a blend of Nerello Mascalese from both the 2006 and 2007 vintages) is one of Cornelissen's nicest wines. There's bright fruit here and an attractive purity that speaks highly of the dramatic volcanic conditions that have shaped it. It's a special wine with a light color and delicate aspect.","designation":"MunJebel Rosso 4"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a Bordeaux blend, and while it's a simple wine, the price isn't bad. It shows plenty of ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, and finishes on the sweet side.","designation":"Field Blend"},{"country":"canada","description":"A very pretty, very varietal wine with notes of strawberry, cherry and jalapeno pepper. The palate is full of luscious, candied red fruit flavors that lead to a spice-filled finish.","designation":"Icewine"},{"country":"de","description":"Whispers of fresh green herbs and lavender lend elegance and refreshment to intensely ripe yet pristine black cherry and plum flavors. The palate is succulent and juicy, marked by crisp, cutting acidity. Fine, velvety tannins cushion a long finish. Drinks well now but should hold beautifully till at least 2024.","designation":"Schwarzer Adler"},{"country":"cl","description":"A Starbucks special, meaning the nose is all about roasted, toasted coffee aromas. Somewhere amid the darkness there's black fruit, and with time it emerges despite the fact that it's a coffee-dominant wine. Good feel, depth and texture keep it positive.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"it","description":"Nero di Troia, a native grape of Southern it, shows its potential thanks to its aromas of berry fruit, Spanish cedar and drying minerals. The wine tastes simple and easy but manages to be elegant and penetrating nonetheless.","designation":"Violante"},{"country":"za","description":"Dainty and nuanced, this crisp citrus-driven Chard offers background notes of almond skin and pear to flesh out the mouth.

The palate follows with creamy floral peach notes on an incredibly light-bodied fluid palate of great intensity and stony depth.

Iron fist, silk glove, utterly delicious.","designation":"Clos Pepe Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Very big, very rich, almost a fruit store in itself. Offers a wild ride of intensely ripe, extracted cherries, currants, blackberries and blueberries that taste like jam spread on buttery toast, then sprinkled with cinnamon and cocoa. Also fairly tannic and full-bodied. Lacks some delicacy, but delicious and dramatic.","designation":"Garys' Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"This Chard is rich yet crisply acidic and complex. Shows plenty of new French oak, but wears it well, with the pineapple, mango, honeysuckle and mineral flavors standing up. Delicious now, and will hold in the bottle for 4‚Äì5 years.","designation":"Hudson Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"This wine enjoys the fruitiness of the vintage with its black-currant flavors and light tannic structure. The blend is 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc. The Cabernets, with ripe berry flavors that dominate here, give a firm core to the wine while not losing the potential of the fruit. Drink from 2017.","designation":"Cru Bourgeois"},{"country":"de","description":"This is a rich, full-bodied dry Riesling. Honey, baked fruit and dried spices mix on the nose, while the flavors are a complex m√©lange of baked fruit, spice and mineral. This finishes with great intensity and length, courtesy of salty, brinelike minerality.","designation":"Forster Jesuitengarten Grosses Gew√§chs Sp√§tlese Trocken"},{"country":"au","description":"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white. Grapefruit, spice and green apple coat the palate, the texture is fairly rich‚Äîmaybe even fat for Riesling‚Äîbut there's good acidity to support the fruit. Finishes long with white peach and mineral notes.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"A firm and focused Cabernet Franc, with just 5% Merlot in the blend, this spent 18 months in 50% new American oak. It's a straight-ahead style, with a red berry flavor and polished, proportionate tannins.","designation":"Burning Desire"},{"country":"de","description":"Layers of smoked nut and dark toast aromas lend savoriness to slightly muted black cherry and plum notes in this dry Lemberger, a.k.a.

This is an accessible food wine that finishes with peppery spice.","designation":"Gradenthal"},{"country":"us","description":"If you don't cellar this Cab, you'll miss out on what it has to offer. It is a dry, deeply flavored, superbly structured wine, rich in tannins, with brooding depths of flavors ranging from black currants, cassis and licorice to hints of dried herbs and sweet, toasty cedar wood. The alcohol is on the high side, in the modern Napa style, but the wine wears its heat well. Start drinking it after 2018.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"cl","description":"Rosy in color, with gritty, earthy aromas of dried red fruits and horse, this coastal Pinot is lean, tangy and citric in the mouth. Pie cherry, tomato and oregano flavors finish zippy, short and with a tomato sauce aftertaste.","designation":"Kuda"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a young, grapy wine, with primary scents of grapes accented with cola and tomato leaf. You taste grapes, berries, ginger and herb, with an interesting creamy streak of milk chocolate. It's a well-made wine with surprising complexity and length.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"Far better known as a Pinot Noir producer, Roessler has released this dry Riesling from 25-year-old vines, and it's a terrifically interesting, distinctive California white wine. At 4 years of age, it's bone dry, showing crisp, vibrant Anderson Valley acidity, and is showing the oily, diesel, peach, honeysuckle and hazelnut flavors of a maturing, Alsatian-style Riesling. Should continue to develop bottle complexity for another decade.","designation":"Wiley Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Slightly sweet and chewy, this waxy expression of Gew√ºrztraminer opens with bright tones of exotic fruit, honeysuckle, white rose, dried ginger and candied lemon rind. The aromatic intensity is impressive and the wine is extra creamy and rich on the close.","designation":"Aim√®"},{"country":"de","description":"Pink grapefruit and waxy lanolin notes entice on this intensely fruity, honey-kissed Riesling. Medium sweet in style, it's chock full of luscious pineapple and blossom notes, but nervous with bristling lemon-lime acidity.

It has a dry edge to it of bright white and citrus fruits along with a floral character that is enticing and open. The wine is lively and ready to drink.","designation":"Tradition Brut"},{"country":"us","description":"Tough and gritty in tannins, this Cabernet is still raw. There's a flattering core of ripe blackberry and black currant fruits, but the wine doesn't show the approachability of other 2007 Cabernets. Give it another five years in the cellar, but no guarantees that the fruit will outlast the tannins.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"ar","description":"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Swirls of smoke and freshly pressed apples entice on the nose of this lean, dry Riesling.

The finish remains highly structured, ending on notes of espresso and dark fruit.","designation":"Trawsfynydd"},{"country":"it","description":"Mature apricot, Spanish broom and a hint of candied citrus aromas lead to the extremely ripe dense palate along with honey and a confectionery note. A taste of almond backs up the rather bitter finish.","designation":"Alba della Torre Secco"},{"country":"us","description":"A blend of 73% Petite Sirah with 17% Zinfandel, this is a black, inky wine, as to be expected, from Spring Mountain's longstanding York Creek Vineyard.
