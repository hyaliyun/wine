Will develop over the next decade.","designation":"Two Acres"},{"country":"es","description":"Heavily herbal spicy leafy aromas are green like cool-climate Cab Franc, and then a massive bolt of oaky char takes over. This Cabernet Sauvignon is hard, drying and tough on the palate. Herbal roasted black-fruit flavors are smothered in burnt oak, while this is blackened but green tasting on the finish. Ripeness of fruit was clearly an issue in this cool vintage.","designation":"Pago Valdebellón"},{"country":"fr","description":"In this crisp, fresh, very dry rosé Champagne, the red fruits are laced with acidity and apple.

For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"es","description":"Grapefruit and other citrus aromas are zesty but standard.

Flavors of orange and tangerine finish fresh but continue the one-note theme.","designation":"Rosa Nautica"},{"country":"us","description":"The deep orange-gold color makes this wine look like a late-harvest version, and fragrant floral and apricot aromas continue that impression.

The palate is rich with black cherry and vanilla flavors, cut by dark spice, lingering acidity and tannic depth.","designation":"Renegade"},{"country":"us","description":"The blend includes a half-dozen grapes, principally Mourvèdre and Syrah. It tastes muted, as if the mélange of fruit sources more or less cancelled each other out. It's a quaffable, generic red with orange peel highlights and tart acidity.","designation":"Virga"},{"country":"au","description":"Already showing a bit of bricking, this is a full-bodied Shiraz that's a bit coarse in texture, with aromas and flavors of plum and brown sugar.

A food wine for sure, it needs to be paired with a slab of rare meat.","designation":"Marquis de Lafayette"},{"country":"au","description":"Yes, a certain amount of acidity is desirable in aun Riesling, but this one is exceedingly lean and crisp.

The citrus and tropical-fruit flavors are rich yet elegant, topped by a lengthy finish.","designation":"Ethos Reserve Late Harvest"},{"country":"us","description":"Soft and pretty, this marries light spice to fruit flavors of apple and strawberry.

Fresh acidity gives the finish a slight boost.","designation":"Extra Dry"},{"country":"us","description":"A blend of Peachy Canyon Estate (67%) and Mustang Springs Ranch (33%) fruit.

Blackberries, cherries and chocolate nibs explode in the mouth, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The tannins and acids lend it integrity, and the finish is miraculously dry.

Cascading flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are drenched in caramel, mocha and buttery barrel flavors. Although the wine lists at a hefty 14.9% alcohol, it does not sacrifice elegance, nor does it substitute power for polish.

It should perform well at the dinner table.","designation":"Angiolina Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"From a vineyard and winery founded in 1996 by Judy Aron (one of the first women vintners in the region), this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 20% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot shows fresh aromas of black plum, blueberry, violet, lava rocks and wet cement. The tannins are polished and soft, but provide a stiff-enough backbone to hold up black-currrant flavors that are enhanced with flashes of caramel.","designation":"Berrichon"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a good wine, fancy and dry, with plenty of acidity.

Drink from 2017.","designation":"Cuvée Paradoxe Premier Cru"},{"country":"fr","description":"A wood-laden bottling, produced from a selection of wines at Patache d'Aux.

It will age well.","designation":"Domaine Long-Depaquit Moutonne Grand Cru"},{"country":"us","description":"Merlot has never been St. Supery's strong suit, and this wine shows the winery's continuing struggle.

It's an intense wine, with delicious, full concentration of flavors.","designation":"Vieilles Vignes"},{"country":"it","description":"It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched.","designation":"Case Basse"},{"country":"es","description":"Light cherry and berry aromas are a bit candied, and the palate is more so. It's almost sugary sweet, but fortunately the wine has good acidity and bounce, so it's not cloying or sticky. Definitely for fans of white Zin and other sweet rosés.","designation":"Brut Rosado"},{"country":"at","description":"Spritzy, citrus-focused refreshment sets the tone on nose and palate.

Muted citrus flavors are highlighted by orange zest and light acidity. The wine is ready to drink.","designation":"Nana Branco"},{"country":"nz","description":"This limited-production wine is complex and savory, and it features notes of beets, sous bois and cherries, layered with touches of creamy cocoa and coffee. It's on the full-bodied side of things, but it remains supple and shows great focus on the lengthy finish. Drink now and over the next few years.","designation":"Four Barriques"},{"country":"ar","description":"Like many wines from this vintage, Melipal seems afflicted with 2005 blues.

Gets better with airing and will show best with food, but it's clearly a step down from prior years.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit.

Striking acidity and bold, angular tannins soften on the palate, revealing a smooth, luscious finish.","designation":"G6"},{"country":"cl","description":"Shows some roughness and burnt leaves on the nose, but it settles on raspberry and cherry. In the mouth, it's a bit soft and flat due to low acidity, and the flavors lean toward sweet and candied, as if some residual sugar was left on the wine. Tastes good enough, but it's candied and simple. Drink now.","designation":"Puerto Viejo PV"},{"country":"us","description":"Sourced from several appellations, including the producer's heritage Russian River Valley site, this wine offers smoky oak, bacon and blackberry jam flavors. Thick and florally perfumed, it balances its brawnier side with spice.","designation":"Estate Vineyards Knotty Vines"},{"country":"es","description":"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas.

Drink now but age for five years or more.","designation":"Blanc de Blancs Brut"},{"country":"us","description":"Nothing subtle about this big, fruity, tannic wine. It's bone dry and the tannins are soft and dusty, in the Rutherford way, but definitely there. They add an astringency to the black currant, mushu plum sauce and cedar flavors.

Best after 2011.","designation":"Usibeli Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Light, clear and softly crafted to highlight dried herb and cranberry tea, this is a rounded, approachably complex wine, a nice representative of the vintage, warm and easy. Peppery cola closes things out with length and grace.","designation":"Dutton Ranch Widdoes Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"There's a salty, gravelly stone character to this medium-bodied wine that largely defines it, marking the grapes original home in the vineyard's Sand Hill block, planted entirely to one Dijon clone.

It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol.","designation":"Foreshadow"},{"country":"us","description":"Soft, bitter and overripe, with raisin, mocha and Port flavors. It's a Rhône-style blend.","designation":"Heritage"},{"country":"es","description":"Flat aromas of lacquer and cured ham are not all that fruity, and the palate on this Viura is not deep or serious. Mildly oxidized flavors of white fruits and ham are more savory than bright. Drink immediately.","designation":"Blanco"},{"country":"cl","description":"Crushed mineral, herbs and solid berry and plum aromas lead to a tannic, wide, grabby palate with sweet flavors of raspberry jam, prune and brown sugar. Turns heavier and more chunky and baked on the finish. Definitely a ripe Cab.","designation":"Single Vineyard"},{"country":"es","description":"Earthy, oaky, leathery berry and spice aromas come around nicely with airing. This is a plump Rioja with modern leanings; it has good structure and pretty raspberry and cassis flavors. A round finish hints at raisiny maturity but doesn't overdo the ripeness. Drink through 2015.","designation":"Beautiful Things"},{"country":"us","description":"A rare 100% varietal Mourvèdre. The tannins are superb, almost silky, almost impossible to achieve with this rough and tumble grape. Dark, smoky, earthy and still refined, this seduces with clean, wild blueberry fruit, just hinting at a mountain berry sweetness.","designation":"Vox Populi"},{"country":"at","description":"Spicy oak flavors dominate the nose and marry beautifully with the red berry, cherry and forest floor notes. This is Pinot made in an international style that nonetheless keeps its atn backbone of fresh acidity and lovely, tingling pepper spice. The fact that this is from 2010 and has just began to show its colors signals its seriousness. It is ready now but will also reward further cellaring. Such depth and length at 12.5% are a real achievement—in its own wonderful way, Pinot is never about power.","designation":"Kalkofen"},{"country":"pt","description":"This is a full and spicy wine that is rich with black plum and berry flavors. The wood comes through strongly with its cedar and pepper character. The contrast with fresher acidity gives this wine its balance.

It displays the spicy herbaceousness of this AVA, with excellent penetration and balance. A strong finish hits a resonant note of minerality.","designation":"Lumière"},{"country":"it","description":"Spice notes take center stage and are enhanced by deep tones of blackberries, cherries, black chocolate and espresso. This Montepulciano, made by celebrated enologist Stefano Chioccioli, is a bit raw and thorny in the mouth and has sour tannins.","designation":"Palio"},{"country":"england","description":"Pink-graprefruit zest and fresh strawberry, tart red apple and shortbread—what the nose promises, the palate keeps. These flavours swirl briskly around the palate, supported by a multitude of tiny, creamy bubbles. Red currant and cranberry, freshly cut red-apple peel and wonderful depth leave a lasting impression and leave you wanting more.","designation":"Balfour Brut Rosé"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a stunning example of modern-day Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. It's soft, complex, smooth and sweet, with a veneer of smoky, caramelized oak coating the flavors of ripe blackberry, black cherry and crème de cassis. It's really delicious, and made all the more appealing by a fine structure of tannins and acids.","designation":"Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"An inaugural release, this is made from specific blocks grown in Knights Valley and Alexander Valley as well as from the high-elevation Cooley Ranch. Leathery and tannic, it coils in youthful aggression, just barely allowing for a taste of blackberry jam and chocolate.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"Made in an immediately appealing, oaky way, this Chard has appealing peach, pear, green apple and honey flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie. Easy to find, with more than a million bottles in circulation.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"il","description":"Dark violet in the glass, this wine has aromas of blackberry and smoked meat. Hefty but not overpowering tannins create a backdrop for flavors of black plum, cassis, toffee, juniper and chocolate covered coffee bean. Fruit flavors and a plush mouthfeel power through the smooth toffee-laced finish.","designation":"Kerem Kedesh"},{"country":"us","description":"Although 2013 may have been a difficult vintage, for some winemakers it resulted in immaculate wines with impeccable precision and focus. In this wine, the medium-bodied fruit runs from apple to pineapple. Twenty months in 10% new French oak has left an indelible impression of buttered nuts and a pleasantly oily mouthfeel.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"es","description":"For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey. Tomato, plum and herbal flavors amount to a saucy whole, while this is fresh, herbal and brothy tasting on a crisp finish.","designation":"Gran Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"The aromas start out quite locked up, with notes of purple fruit and flowers. The palate reveals fresh, quite pure aromas, with well-balanced acid and tannins and a finish that lingers.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"The two parcels that go into this wine have performed well in 2012. This solid, dense wine is firm with tannins and rich with red plum and berry fruits. It is perfumed, ripe and concentrated. With this structure and with the acidity, it will age, so drink from 2018.","designation":"Les Brunettes et Planchots"},{"country":"de","description":"Intensely herbaceous notes of fresh green leaves and stems add briskness to crisp red-plum and cherry flavors in this full bodied, yet keenly balanced wine. Wisps of violet on the palate and soft, furry tannins lend it an elegant feel.","designation":"Neipperger Schlossberg"},{"country":"us","description":"The 2010 BlackJack is loaded with tart cranberry and pomegranate fruit flavors. There is a streak of iron and darker notes that come through in earthy, slighted roasted tannins. The complexity is intriguing and adds depth to a rather light vintage.","designation":"Estate BlackJack"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine is subtle at first, but each sip brings more richness, nuance and layers. Soft, lightly spicy vanilla aromas lead the nose while Bosc pear, cream and marzipan flavors unfold on the palate. The texture is rich from the beginning and seems to grow more luxurious as it opens, lingering long into the finish.","designation":"Teal Bartolucci Vineyards Big Valley Ranch Made With Organically Grown Grapes"},{"country":"gr","description":"Aromas of fleshy white fruits and spice give this Greek white a soulful edge. On the palate, clean, bracing flavors of bright lemon and minerals mean this is a multiple-glass choice. This should pair well with grilled octopus and fish.","designation":"Assyrtiko"},{"country":"pt","description":"This ripe, perfumed wine is an opulent blend of Touriga Nacional with smaller proportions of Tinta Roriz and Alfrocheiro. It is juicy, ripe, concentrated and dense, with abundant black fruits. This harmonious wine could age a little longer and will be at its best from 2018.","designation":"Ribeiro Santo Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Brooding, very varietal aromas of grass, herbs and citrus lead to broad fruit flavors that dip in the middle, with some reduction providing a bit of distraction. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should perk up at the dinner table.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"This soft Zin bursts with blackberry and cherry fruit. Grippy, it's savory in coffee and leather with a slight astringency to the finish. It tends to be among Sobon's better bottlings every year.","designation":"Cougar Hill"},{"country":"it","description":"A blend of 85% Nerello Mascalese and 15% international varieties, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, mocha, vanilla and grilled bell pepper. The aromas carry through to the palate, along with cassis, cedar and graphite.","designation":"Fatagione"},{"country":"us","description":"Barrel aromas are up front on this wine, with notes of char, smoke and coffee bean ahead of herb and cherry. On the palate, the barrel influence also seems to overwhelm the fruit, which doesn't quite have the strength to stand up. Additional time in the bottle might bring it around.","designation":"The Albatross Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"Seeing no new oak, the fruit is front and center. The flavors of pepper, dark fruit and herbs are pure, concentrated and soft in feel with a tart uptick on the finish.","designation":"Hogback Ridge Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Once again this vineyard delivers irresistibly bright refined flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit—primary, concentrated and immaculately fresh. There's a touch of mocha from the new barrels, and impressive length. As with all of Trisaetum's single vineyard Pinots, this is built for cellaring, and should drink best after another couple of years in bottle. Drink 2018–2028, perhaps beyond.","designation":"Ribbon Ridge Estate"},{"country":"cl","description":"The Elqui Valley is the new source for this Syrah, and we like its leathery, complex, smoky nose that foretells layered blackberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Fairly thick and modern, but balanced, with a long, lightly minty finish. Interesting and well seasoned with oak.","designation":"1865 Limited Edition"},{"country":"us","description":"Shows some pretty good acids and tannins, which makes the wine feel juicy and brisk in candied blackberry and cherry fruit. Finishes almost sweet, but not quite, with the tannins closing in and drying things out. The impression is of an immature wine, not showing well now. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar.","designation":"Clift Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Made entirely with Grechetto, this opens with scents of acacia flower, citrus and hay. The savory palate offers yellow peach, cantaloupe and an almond note while crisp acidity gives it a clean finish.","designation":"Fiorfiore"},{"country":"us","description":"Deep dark black fruit is seasoned in big bold flavors of graphite, dried herb and chocolate. Full bodied and robustly ripe, this wine has a touch of heat to it, finishing in a smack of leather and tar.","designation":"Pritchett Peak Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"This opens with earthy aromas of turned soil, under brush and black cherry. The palate delivers dense black-fruit and almond notes, but it's already somewhat evolved so drink soon.","designation":"Le Muraie"},{"country":"us","description":"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest.","designation":"Squirrel Tooth Alice"},{"country":"us","description":"The nose on this bottling is very familiar and approachable, with tons of baking spices like clove, star anise and vanilla alongside red cherries. The same red fruit upholds the palate, which is nuanced by eucalyptus and bay leaf as well as a graphite minerality.","designation":"La Entrada"},{"country":"it","description":"A blend of Nero di Troia and Cabernet Sauvignon, this conveys aromas of scorched earth, cedar, black currant, leather and game. The palate is showing some age, offering dried plum, mature blackberry, graphite, roasted coffee bean and licorice but not much fruit richness. It finishes on an astringent note.","designation":"Kebir"},{"country":"fr","description":"This fresh, crisp wine has plenty of lively citrus fruits that are enriched by red apple and zesty orange flavors. The wine is already delicious in its fruitiness and ready to drink.","designation":"Coulée des Moulins"},{"country":"morocco","description":"Aromas of black cherry, espresso bean and white chocolate tease the palate in this Moroccan blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah. Brightness reigns despite powerful tannins, and flavors of black cherry, rhubarb, jalapeño, coriander seed, vanilla and citrus zest are a pleasure on the tongue.","designation":"Médaillon"},{"country":"fr","description":"From a small vineyard near the coast at Hyères, this wine has the freshest red-berry fruits and lively, bright acidity. Its freshness and lightness make it a fine apéritif style, delicious to drink immediately.","designation":"Château Castel des Maures Cuvée Jeanne"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is labeled as dry, which sums up this crisp and fruity wine. Delicious, refreshing acidity is gently spiced and layered with green apples and quince flavors. It's ready to drink.","designation":"Bonheur Convivial"},{"country":"au","description":"This big wine presents a sophisticated bouquet of toasty, leesy, nutty aromas. Fine depth of fruit and plenty of quality oak show here, with butterscotch, pear and apple flavors. Full-bodied and luscious, it shows the tremendous attention paid and importance assigned to this flagship white. The long, spicy finish sports complex lemon, leesy and mineral accents. To be released 5/01.","designation":"Yattarna"},{"country":"us","description":"Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors. Tannins are smooth, supple and ripe. Long, lush and decadent on the finish.","designation":"Herb Lamb Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"It's difficult to match the pure, expressive fruit and focus of this medium- to full-bodied, concentrated and complex wine. Substantial, enticing aromas of red and black cherry with a touch of butter lead to cherry, rhubarb, forest floor and mint notes on the palate. The mouthfeel is full but lively, and the finish lingers nicely. Best after 2022.","designation":"Gloria Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"A light pretty wine, this brings a mix of strawberry and Bing cherry front and center. There's no real density or complexity; the fruit is fresh and clean and follows through in a light consistent finish.","designation":"Meyer Vineyard"},{"country":"at","description":"Slightly lactic notes on the nose detract from the citrusy freshness of the simply refreshing, easy-drinking palate.","designation":"Lobster"},{"country":"nz","description":"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc at a lovely price, this shows characteristic notes of snow pea, cut grass and tropical fruit upfront, followed by hints of pink grapefruit and nectarine. It's medium in weight, with a long, stony finish.","designation":"Map Maker"},{"country":"us","description":"This blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Viognier is almost dessert-like in aromas, conveying lemon candy and browned honey.

Strikes of lemon-lime acidity add zest and vibrance through a long, lingering finish.","designation":"Ice Wine"},{"country":"us","description":"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach.","designation":"Estate Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is from Jess Jackson-owned vineyards high above Alexander Valley.

It's a delicious, seductive wine that should ride out the next 8 years with ease.","designation":"Red Wine"},{"country":"es","description":"Horseradish and berry aromas are a touch rough and tough. This tannic Garnacha features a pinched, hard mouthfeel and tight, drawing flavors of berry fruits and plum. Peppery harshness and rubbery tannins define the finish.","designation":"Filón Real"},{"country":"fr","description":"On the dusty, earthy side of the Rhône spectrum, with hints of cordite accenting cherry fruit. It's undeniably fresh and vibrant, just lacks some of the richness characteristic of the 2007 vintage.","designation":"L'Andéol Rasteau"},{"country":"fr","description":"This aromatic, red-cherry flavored wine demonstrates the freshness of the year and the grape.

A good buy made from the obscure Bobal variety and Tempranillo.","designation":"Protocolo Rosado"},{"country":"us","description":"An incredibly well-made and well-priced Viognier, from Cedarville's very own decomposed granite-filled soils high atop Fair Play. Opening with faint floral honey, wet stone and pear aromas, the flavors follow through accordingly, and the wine just continues to please with full-integrated minerality.
