It's a monster of a Cab that's quite tannic and therefore narrow on the palate. But if given time in a good cellar it may soften into something much more evolved than it is now.

For beginners, the nose is only mildly expressive: cola, modest berry aromas and oak are what you get. And in the mouth, oak is quite dominant, almost to the point of overshadowing the Tempranillo fruit. As a whole it's balanced, healthy and sturdy.

Prior exhibits the slightest aromatic notes of raisin and prune, but mostly it zeroes in on dense but fresh black fruit, schist and black olives. It's full-bodied but neither mean nor tannic.

The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced.

Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits.

Completely non-interventionist (no acid or water additions), this immaculate wine brings the winery's customary bold aromas into play, following with the crisply defined fruit, rind and barrel notes. The finish is like caramel-dipped apples.","designation":"Conner Lee Vineyard","title":"Buty 2006 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"it","description":"The nice thing about this dessert wine is that you can recognize those distinctive musky notes that come from botrytis. This unique vineyard phenomenon only occurs in a handful of Italian vineyards and Fattoria Zerbina is lucky enough to have one.

It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.","designation":"","title":"Pepper Bridge 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure.

From Hagafen.","designation":"Reserve Melange","title":"Prix 2004 Reserve Melange Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins.

It imparts sweet cherry flavors in the mouth, silky tannins and bright crisp fruit: A very modern Italian red.","designation":"","title":"Paniole 2004  Maremma"},{"country":"US","description":"This new, limited release red blend is what winery owners Myles Anderson and Gordy Venneri called their version of a super Tuscan. It's half old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon from the Sagemoor vineyard, and half Sangiovese. Somehow the two grapes soften each other, keeping the old vine detail and dried herbal character of the Cab, and mixing in plush and spicy red fruit with hints of mushroom and olive. Just 240 cases were made and the wine is sold exclusively at the winery.","designation":"Bello Rosso","title":"Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Bello Rosso Red (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing.
