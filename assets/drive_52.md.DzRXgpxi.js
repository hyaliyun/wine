This is one of three ros√©s made by Proulx, and they are all rather subtle in expression, this one delivering a bit of lime and decent amount of tannic grip to the palate. It would be a great match for anything rich in texture but light in flavor, as it could be easily overwhelmed.","designation":"Willow Creek Farm"},{"country":"it","description":"Notes of chocolate fudge, cherry, toasted vanilla and espresso peel off layer after layer to reveal a true star of the Valpolicella.

It would pair beautifully with a heaping plate of spaghetti con le vongole.","designation":"Poggio Verde"},{"country":"cl","description":"Your first take on this heavily oaked, natural-yeast Chard is that it's a three-alarm smoke alert. Few, if any, Chilean Chardonnays are this overtly oaky. But the wood is of high quality, and the more time you give it the more you find apple, citrus and spice. Yes, it's still resiny. But the balance and natural character of the wine are very good.

Drink from 2020.","designation":"Pintas"},{"country":"us","description":"Both sour and black cherry join with blackberry on this wine from Laetitia. It delivers a rich, full mouth, with a good tannic grip and lasting finish‚Äîperhaps in part due to the inclusion of stems in the fermentation process.

This serious Pinot Noir is built to improve in the cellar through 2007.","designation":"Les Galets"},{"country":"us","description":"A good amalgam of Red Mountain flavors‚Äîhard, tight tannins; dark, smoky black fruits; an underlayer of graphite and mineral. The wine is hard and compact, unyielding, but well-balanced and complete. In the nose are suggestions of moist earth, compost, soy, seaweed; the message is, stay tuned.","designation":"Ruckus"},{"country":"au","description":"Octavius has always been oaky, but over the years the fruit has come into better balance, and the 2009 may be one of the most successful editions yet released. It's dense and impenetrable at first, only slowly yielding hints of plum, mocha and vanilla. The texture is rich and supple enough to make the wine approachable now, but it should evolve and improve through 2020 or beyond.","designation":"The Octavius"},{"country":"us","description":"Blossomy and pert, this is an elegant ros√© sparkling offering fresh, juicy cherry and raspberry flavors. Bristling acidity and tiny, persistent p√©tillance invigorate the palate.

Dark tannins show alongside the smooth and polished texture from new-wood aging. With the structure come rich black currant and dark plum fruits and acidity. The wine will be best aged until 2017.","designation":"Haut de l'Hermitage"},{"country":"fr","description":"Although this is labeled as Vin de fr, its fruit comes from the La B√©gude estate in Bandol. With one year's aging, it is full, soft and ripe with generous strawberry flavors. Dark in color, it may not follow the trend in Provence for pale ros√©s and its taste is rich and full bodied. The acidity at the end gives the necessary freshness.","designation":"L'Irr√©ductible"},{"country":"us","description":"Made in a richer marzipan-laced style, this bottling shows browned butter, butterscotch and baked apples on the nose. The palate is a tad oily with strong browned-butter and green-apple flavors, but also very balanced, with the unctuous custard elements cut by tart citrus peels.","designation":"Cheryl's"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is aromatic, with ripeness that balances the bright green and white fruits. Wood and spice notes are followed by a touch of lemon jelly and minerally acidity. It's a wine that is still developing, waiting for the ripe fruit of the vintage to surface.","designation":"Clos St-Jean Premier Cru"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine is a blend of 40% each Mourv√®dre and Syrah along with 15% Petite Sirah and 5% Viognier. Aromas of orange zest, flowers, raw meat and peppery spices lead to a soft palate, full of citrus flavors that seem a bit out of balance but that still provide intrigue.","designation":"Harvest Moon"},{"country":"us","description":"This is fairly sweet but not as sweet as you'd expect given its 7% residual sugar. Credit the vivid acidity built in to Washington Riesling grapes (though labeled American, the grapes are all Washington). It's got plenty of mixed fruits and as the back label suggests, it's a good choice to pair with spicy Asian foods.","designation":"Sweet"},{"country":"es","description":"While this isn't easy to identify as Shiraz, it still qualifies as a good, everyday red wine. Rubbery berry aromas come with a pinch of spearmint, while the palate feels juicy and racy. Berry and mild oak flavors finish with a chocolate note and a rubbery accent.","designation":"√ìpera Prima"},{"country":"us","description":"A pretty peach color, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (79%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of dried herbs, bell pepper and spice lead to dry cherry and green pepper flavors. There's interest but the bell pepper notes take over.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"You'll find a nice, silky texture on this Pinot Noir, as well as lush flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, sweet tobacco and dusty baking spices. There's some sharpness all the way through that detracts.","designation":"Erwin Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Made with 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of black currant, anise and leather. The firm palate delivers blackberry jam, cedar and toast alongside assertive tannins while a hint of vanilla marks the firm finish.

Along with that feeling of richness, it also contains balanced acidity. Full, crisp and lively, the fresh and fruity aftertaste is delicious.","designation":"Tradition Premier Cru Brut"},{"country":"it","description":"Thick purple foam tops this bubbly Lambrusco as it sits in the glass. In the mouth, the wine is semisecco, or slightly sweet, and it delivers plump aromas of black fruit and raspberry jam.","designation":"Contrada Borgoleto"},{"country":"at","description":"Exuberant notes of tropical passion fruit rise from the glass in this unusually aromatic Gr√ºner Veltliner. Citrusy freshness pervades everything, giving lively direction to the bright, slightly spritzy palate. The finish is zesty, clean and refreshing.","designation":"Steinagrund"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dark in color, with aromas of road tar, blackberry and burnt toast.

Regular but good value.","designation":"Natura"},{"country":"ar","description":"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price.","designation":"Elsa"},{"country":"it","description":"This 60-40 Greco and Malvasia blend is among the most representative quality white wines from the Puglia region. Aromas of pear, stone fruit and white mineral are backed by creamy warm-climate nuances and a thick consistency. The wine is not oak fermented or aged although it tastes as if it had been. Botromagno was founded in 1991 by the D'Agostino family, following a long history as a cooperative winery.","designation":"Gravina"},{"country":"fr","description":"As with several wines from Bourg, this has Malbec (20%) in the blend, a continuation of a long tradition.

Drink from 2018.","designation":"Cuv√©e Prestige"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a romantic conjunction of names.

A spicy saucy-tasting finish holds onto the wine's minty green herbal essence.","designation":"Gran Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"Lushly rich on both the nose and the palate, this wine from the heart of the appellation is etched in chocolate and cedar, showing a ying-yang pull between savory and sweet. Currant and dried herb season chalky, firm tannin and toasted oak.","designation":"The Leap Estate Grown"},{"country":"us","description":"This concentrated, full-bodied wine blends 80% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, all grown from the producer's Upper Bench blocks known for cobbly soils. Brick, tar and pencil shavings accent a considerable presence of tannin and toasty oak. It should show best from 2020 to 2022.","designation":"Reminiscence Estate Grown"},{"country":"es","description":"Complex aromas of olive, dried leaves, kirsch and cassis set up a spunky, acid-rich palate that's integrated and well balanced. Flavors of vanilla, herbs, tobacco and earthy plum and raspberry finish with elegance and thoroughness. This intense, pure gran reserva will age well for another 15 years, maybe longer.","designation":"Gran Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Among the producer's most luxurious offerings, this nearly 100% varietal wine (with 2% Petit Verdot) is grippy in tobacco and big, pillowy tannin. The leaner side of its personality is defined by classic notions of cedar, currant and graphite, while its other aspect reveals riper elements of mountain blackberry and chocolate mocha. They all work well together in sync.","designation":"M by Michael Mondavi"},{"country":"es","description":"Ripe berry aromas are a bit raisiny, with vanilla and balsam wood notes. This Tempranillo feels blocky, saturated and tannic. Flavors of raisin, prune, blackberry and wood spice are full and bullish, while a boundary-pushing finish maintains a palpable raisiny quality. Drink through 2020.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Subtle hints of vanilla, lavender and spice lend depth to pristine peach and pear flavors in this judiciously balanced Chardonnay. It's fleshy and plump in mouthfeel but zesty lime notes keep the finish vibrant.

Finishes with a lingering sheen of oyster-shell minerality.","designation":"Reminisce"},{"country":"cl","description":"This cooler-vintage Le Dix, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best on record. Dry, lightly oaked aromas of ripe berry and cassis include a hint of vanilla. A compact palate delivers blunt-force red-berry and black currant flavors. On the finish, this simmers with modest heat as well as oak and caf√© mocha flavors. Drink through 2026.","designation":"Le Dix de Los Vascos Estate Grown"},{"country":"ar","description":"Smells like crushed vitamins, iron and minerals, but no fruit. Weak, funky and sour tasting, and then angular on the finish. There's even some sauerkraut in the mix. Not what we're looking for.","designation":"Finca La Martina"},{"country":"us","description":"This has 10% Monastrell in the mix, and it is a sublime example of what flavors of baked raspberry compote, cranberry and black licorice can do when allowed to mingle together in liquid form. Medium in body, this has a lot of earthiness. It would make a fine alternative to more expensive Pinots.","designation":"Terra Alta Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Rich and impressive, not only for its wealth of concentrated flavor, but for the full-bodied mouthfeel and overall polish. It's showing flashy cherry, currant and pomegranate fruit now, but the tannins are fairly hefty, while the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. Wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2016.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"A softly layered, elegant estate wine, this slowly reveals shocks of cherry, vanilla and coconut. A tanginess to the tannins gives it an oomph of verve and freshness on the palate.","designation":"Estate St. Helena Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"This vineyard bottling is very vintage driven. The cool 2009 harvest has made it ripe and tart in cherry pie flavors, but also rather tannic. It's aloof, revealing little of its soul, beyond the primary fruit and oak. Needs time in the cellar. Could really be interesting over the next decade.","designation":"Mills"},{"country":"de","description":"Nuances of bramble and grain lend earthy complexity to this otherwise deeply fruity Riesling. Lemon-lime acidity pierces the midpalate, cutting through layers of ripe yellow-cherry and even berry flavors. The finish is lip smackingly sweet. Drink now.","designation":"Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Grosse Lage"},{"country":"us","description":"Tannic and acidic now, with a bite-down mouthfeel, although the overall texture is nice and silky, and shows the elegance of Pinot Noir. Give it a few years in the cellar to let the black cherry, currant, anise and cedar flavors mellow and develop.","designation":"Oehlman Vineyard"},{"country":"cl","description":"This reedy smelling, jammy boxed wine is on the cusp of acceptability. It's gooey in feel, a bit fake and sugary in flavor, and sticky on the finish.","designation":"Gran Verano"},{"country":"fr","description":"Light, fruity and fresh, this has crisp acidity within a strongly herbal context. Citrus and sliced apples give the wine its refreshing fruitiness. Drink now.","designation":"Petit Villebois"},{"country":"fr","description":"Lovely aromas of black olive and dried spices (cinnamon and clove) are followed by dark, earthy flavors.

Firm tannins and balancing acidity complete the picture.","designation":"Lib√©ration"},{"country":"uruguay","description":"Tarry grit and char are the lead aromas on this Tannat that contains 15% Ruby Cabernet, which is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan.

Well balanced, with a lively fruity aftertaste, it is ready to drink now.","designation":"Breezette"},{"country":"us","description":"A pure Syrah from estate fruit, this dark, peppery, earthy wine is saturated with color and ripe fruit flavor. From the Yakima Valley estate, it buttresses the currant and cherry fruit with polished tannins that add many layers of depth and nuances of earth and smoke. The extra bottle time (this is the current release) has also helped to smooth out the rough edges. As the estate vineyard ages and the vines mature, these wines are gaining in both strength and detail.","designation":"Estate Select"},{"country":"fr","description":"Smooth, rounded, with an obvious layer of wood to soften the red fruits and dry tannins. This is a balanced wine, offering some good juicy fruits and a bright red berry finish.","designation":"Prestige"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine comes from the winery's plantings in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, a relatively unexplored region of the valley.

It brings a compelling mouthfeel and sense of balance.","designation":"Estate Foothills in the Sun Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"You'll love the easy, slightly sweet approach of this fresh Prosecco Superiore from the famed Cartizze cru. White flower, mineral and sweet peach appear on the foamy finish.","designation":"Dry"},{"country":"nz","description":"This is less luxuriantly ripe than some of the other 2013 Hawke's Bay Syrahs, showing some firm, dusty tannins on the finish, but it's still a terrific offering. Cracked black pepper, fresh blueberries and cedar notes come together beautifully on the palate, promising much for the future. Drink 2018‚Äì2025.","designation":"Jewelstone"},{"country":"us","description":"Bone dry and firmly tannic, this Syrah has a peppery edge to the blackberry, currant and tamari flavors. It could be more focused and concentrated.

Drink from 2017.","designation":"Branco"},{"country":"pt","description":"This wine is fruity, with attractive supporting tannins and the concentration of old vines.

Drink now.","designation":"Clos des Andes Reserva"},{"country":"it","description":"Poggio Argentato opens with a bright bouquet of green apple, kiwi, cut grass and lemon zest.

Full bodied, fascinating and luscious, it hails from a high-elevation vineyard in Mendocino County.","designation":"Game Trail"},{"country":"it","description":"This wine opens with tertiary aromas of damp earth and mineral, along with notes of brown-banana peel and beeswax. The palate shows a loss of fruit richness and oxidation.","designation":"VINOSO VIni NO SOlfiti"},{"country":"it","description":"Opulent and floral, with pressed rose and blue violets.

Nutty and smooth on the finish.","designation":"Amontillado"},{"country":"us","description":"This is one of the best ros√©s on the market. With a pretty orange and copper color, the wine is dry, crisp and deeply flavored in fruits, yet feels delicate and subtle. The blend is Mourv√®dre, Syrah and Grenache.","designation":"L'Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rh√¥ne is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.","designation":"Corner Pocket Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"This may be dry Chenin Blanc, but there is this tantalizing touch of honey that goes with the crisp apple and fresh quince fruits. The wine has delicious, refreshingly crisp acidity that counterbalances its natural richness.","designation":"Clos de la Division"},{"country":"cl","description":"A little roasted and leafy smelling, which is typical for base-level Chilean Merlot.

Not much structure or tannic bite here, but as a whole it's tasty and gets better as it opens up.","designation":"Classic Series"},{"country":"us","description":"Smells like a shootout in a tomato factory. It's a strong whiff of tomatoes on the vine, followed by tannin and a little sweet, grapy fruit.","designation":"Costa Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"Light and smoky, this is a fruit-forward, soft wine. Berry flavors are balanced by the stalky texture. It's young, although very ready to drink.","designation":"Alain de la Treille"},{"country":"cl","description":"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked, so much so that this Cabernet-Carmen√®re blend smells charred but also like plastic. A big grabby palate is jagged in feel, while this tastes like the nose suggests, meaning oaky, herbal and like berry fruits and plum. A woody finish is short on total integration.","designation":"Limited Selection"},{"country":"us","description":"Scented with green gooseberry aromas, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't for everyone.

It has weight and plenty of ripe fruit. The acidity at the end is fresh and crisp.","designation":"Les Perri√®res"},{"country":"us","description":"Hard and showing an herbal edge, this single-vineyard Merlot will require some further bottle age and/or decanting. It drinks more like a Cabernet than a Merlot, with a green slant to the tannins.","designation":"Pepper Bridge Vineyard"},{"country":"pt","description":"Full-bodied, spicy wine. It has a ripe, toast and apple flavor and a smooth texture, with light acidity. The wine is dry while also soft.","designation":"Casa do Lago Branco"},{"country":"ar","description":"Grassy strawberry and raspberry aromas smell false as well as floral.

It's a powerhouse, sharp and astringent, with edgy flavors of berry and granite. The rock/mineral component dominates the finish, which lingers and gently fades. Overall, this is a wine to cellar and to watch; it tastes like a high-altitude Malbec from a 7,000-foot Argentine vineyard.","designation":"La Bestia Klipsun Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"Crisp and intense, this is all about herbaceous textures and pink grapefruit flavors. It is just on the edge of tartness in its acidity, just escaping because of its great fruitiness. It needs to calm down until late 2014.","designation":"Terre de Silex"},{"country":"us","description":"This blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (48%), Cabernet Franc (23%) and Merlot (20%), with the balance Petit Verdot and Malbec.

This is a bit austere and dusty, but long on the finish, so drink 2018‚Äì2030.","designation":"Pahi Single Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Here's one for the cellar, not just because the tannins are so aggressive, but because the wine is so balanced. With alcohol only 13.8%, it's dry and rich in black currant fruit, almost a throwback to the Napa Cabernets of old that aged so well. It possesses a dry, elegant sophistication that stands in deliberate contrast to today's gooey, sweet style. Best 2009‚Äì2015, if not longer, with proper cellaring.","designation":"VGS"},{"country":"us","description":"The finest Walter Clore since the 2001, this Bordeaux-style blend shows considerable muscle and depth.

Lovely now and for a couple years.","designation":"Sadie's Vineyard"},{"country":"at","description":"The nose just hints at green pear but the palate unfolds with quite some power: there is ripe lemon zest, a phenolic midpalate with textured, peppery citrus notes, the rough but ripe peel of Boc pear and quite a bit of heat on the finish.

The palate is lively but more generic than specific; flavors of bell pepper and asparagus dot the picture, with lime and grapefruit also apparent. A salty, briny finish may stem from the ground water used to irrigate this desert-origin new SB.","designation":"Sumpai Huasco Valley"},{"country":"ar","description":"Sawdust characterizes the nose of this strained ros√©.

The firm, tightly wound palate shows roasted coffee bean, dried cherry and licorice alongside bracing tannins.","designation":"Ravera"},{"country":"us","description":"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.","designation":"Monastery"},{"country":"us","description":"Restrained aromatically, this bottling shows touches of crushed lava rocks, black pepper and blackberry on the nose. Balsamic vinegar and sour cherry flavors mark the sip, with very sticky tannins.","designation":"Grosso"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dark in color, with aromas of raisin, cassis, cough medicine and baked plum.

A soft, lightly bitter-tasting finish could use more pop, scour and balance.","designation":"Serbal"},{"country":"pt","description":"Herbal, almost medicinal aromas set a complex scene for this densely structured wine. The flavors throughout, while rich, are also severe, a wrinkle on the otherwise ripe fa√ßade. That certainly suggests aging, and the dry tannins support this. In the meantime, it is a winter wine, its concentration needing rich meat dishes.","designation":"Monte da Cal Reserva"},{"country":"it","description":"Intensity and persistency characterize this pretty Barolo.

Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak.

Best for keeping; try in two-plus years.","designation":"St. Peter's Church Vineyard"},{"country":"cl","description":"There's no denying this wine's greenness: It's draped all over the nose, palate and finish.

However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food.

A delicious wine, packed with fresh, pure fruit character.","designation":"Innere Bergen"},{"country":"hr","description":"Light yellow in color, this has heady aromas of elderflower, white lemon blossom and freshly picked basil. There are touches of vanilla and honeycomb on the palate, with fresh stone fruit flavors. It's well-balanced, with an energetic acidic finish.","designation":"Kvalitetno Vino Vinogorje"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a supersmooth, easy-going wine with mild dark-fruit flavors, very little tannin and a soft texture. Two years aging in previously used oak barrels helped round off any corners in the mouthfeel.","designation":"Old Vine"},{"country":"pt","description":"A ripe, smooth and richly fruity wine that has a well-integrated structure. Flavors of generous blackberry and red plums are lightly touched by acidity. The wine is ready to drink.","designation":"Brid√£o Cl√°ssico"},{"country":"at","description":"Savory yeastiness joins lemon zestiness and draws a peppery line from start to finish on this refreshing but lightweight wine. Flavors make you want to keep sipping to get to the bottom of these spicy nuances.","designation":"L√∂ss"},{"country":"us","description":"Meditazione bursts out of the glass with a musky, vanilla-spice character that permeates the nose and palate. Fermented in oak with extended skin contact, this is an amber-hued wine that has bold, tea-leaf-like tannins and a gorgeous acidic edge. It's a fascinating effort to be enjoyed over the course of a long, meditative evening.","designation":"Meditazione"},{"country":"us","description":"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.","designation":"Primo's Hill"},{"country":"it","description":"This blend of 50% Friulano, 25% Sauvignon and 25% Malvasia opens with aromas of apple, crushed rock, chamomile flower and a whiff of tomato vine.

An almond note accents the finish.","designation":"La Mont-Brach"},{"country":"us","description":"Fleshy in pineapple and papaya, with a pinch of S√©millon blended within, this wine displays itself in a fuller-bodied style, quite ripe and robust, with strong, lingering flavors of dried apricot and vanilla.","designation":"Danielle Vineyard Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"Testarossa reserves their most expensive wines to a best-barrels blend that usually bears a statewide appellation, a practice that is rare if not unique among California wineries. The '07 Niclaire is vast in currants, rhubarbs, cola and cedar, with sizable but finely meshed tannins, and the tart acidity that marks all of the winery's 2007 Pinot Noirs. It's drinkable now, but just barely, so decant. But will benefit from up to six years in the cellar.","designation":"Niclaire"},{"country":"us","description":"Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill.

It's initially aromatically brooding with high-toned notes of stems, green herbs, coffee, funk and mineral, with generous floral notes providing accents. The palate is rounded and full, with fruit and savory flavors intertwining, showing a very pretty precision. The finish is lengthy.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"ar","description":"This murky Malbec has odd, horsey, berry aromas. It's rough and raw on the palate, with leafy, herbal plum flavors that finish rugged and with a dull spiciness.","designation":"Silver Series"},{"country":"us","description":"With no oak influences at all, this Chard is on the acidic side, with bright, clean flavors of green grapes, yellow apricots and fresh pineapples. It's dry, but rich in fruity essence.","designation":"Unoaked"},{"country":"es","description":"Cedar and coconut aromas rest comfortably atop ripe black fruit scents.

Softened tannins and mellow oak combine to good effect, before an abbreviated finish of vanilla.","designation":"Devils' Peak"},{"country":"gr","description":"Mocha, raspberry, sour cherry and spice are the focus of this plucky red from Skouras. The wine has focus and a masculine edge, and should pair well with dried meats, spicy pasta sauces and salty cheeses.","designation":"Grande Cuv√©e"},{"country":"za","description":"This wine starts with an intriguing nose that is at once floral, fresh and spicy. On the palate, it's racy and fun but has an elegant, delicate edge. A combination of lemon and grass flavors with tropical melons and fruits are balanced and enjoyable. A good go-to white that will pair well with grilled seafood and salads.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"The dryness and length of this Pinot Noir make it especially recommendable. It just feels lush and important in the mouth, offering a wealth of cherry, raspberry, currant, mocha and spice flavors, with a meaty note of beef jerky. Should develop for a good six years in the bottle.","designation":"Hein Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Made with 45% Sangiovese, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has a restrained nose that eventually reveals aromas of cassis, toast and leather. The polished palate shows mature red plum, tobacco and vanilla alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins and somewhat soft acidity.","designation":"Sister Moon"},{"country":"pt","description":"Made from one of the star grapes of Vinho Verde, this is a ripe, creamy wine. It has hints of lemon zest, along with grapefruit and a herbal aftertaste. It is crisp and ready to drink.","designation":"Arca Nova Colheita"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a perfumed wine, spicy and textured.

The tannins are right up front, long-lasting and very structured. The final acidity offers freshness to a wine that will need aging.","designation":"Les Beaux-Monts"},{"country":"fr","description":"Fine tannins, dusty and sweet, play a major part in the success of this wine.
