Beat the butter, egg yolk, vanilla, salt and cloves in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa powder until combined, then beat in the flour in two batches until combined. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and dust with flour. Gently knead until soft but not sticky. Reflour the surface, if necessary, and roll out the dough until slightly thicker than 1/4 inch. Cut out shapes using 3-inch cookie cutters. Gently gather and reroll the scraps. (If the dough is too soft to work with, refrigerate until firm.) Arrange the cutouts about 2 inches apart on 2 unlined baking sheets. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are firm, about 20 minutes. Let cool 3 minutes on the pans, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla and 1 tablespoon milk in a small bowl until smooth. Gradually stir in up to 1 more tablespoon milk until the icing is thick but pourable. Spoon the icing into a small resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner. Pipe the icing on the cookies, then sprinkle with sanding sugar.

Cover the chicken with the light soy sauce, Chinese five-spice powder, salt and garlic, and stir to coat. Toss the chicken with the toasted sesame oil. Let marinate for as much time as you have; for best results, leave the chicken in the refrigerator overnight. When ready to fry, toss the chicken pieces in the cornstarch. Heat a large wok or pan over high heat and add the vegetable oil. Working in batches so as not to crowd the pan, add the chicken and fry lightly until the thighs are golden brown on all sides and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the chicken on paper towels and season them with salt, pepper and cilantro as they come out of the oil. Wrap each piece of newspaper and parchment into a cone shape and secure with a piece of tape. Fill each cone with several pieces of chicken and garnish with more chopped cilantro. Serve alongside a platter of Mixed Salad if desired. In a small bowl, whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, light soy sauce, rice vinegar, and toasted sesame oil; set aside. Toss the lettuce, carrots, chiles and scallions with the dressing when ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 11198,&quot;Lambcarre Provencale 1/2 teaspoon rosemary 1/2 teaspoon basil 1/2 teaspoon thyme 4 teaspoons dry mustard 2 (2-pound) racks lamb, trimmed, outer skin scored diagonally, meat cut out from between ribs Flour, to dust 1 clove garlic, slivered Freshly ground salt, to taste Freshly ground pepper, to taste 1 pound large potatoes, peeled and placed in cold water to cover Clarified butter 1/8 cup white bread crumbs Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine herbs and mustard. Spread on scored skin of lamb, pressing down well into cuts. Dust lightly with flour. Insert garlic slivers into meat in between ribs. Season well with salt and pepper and set aside. Drain potatoes well and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Lightly coat large ovenproof frying pan with clarified butter and heat well. Add potatoes and cook until golden brown, about 9 minutes. Place lamb on top of potatoes and place entire pan into oven. Roast for 30 minutes. Dust lamb with bread crumbs and roast another 30 minutes. Remove meat from oven, drain off fat and place meat on heated serving platter. Turn oven to broil and broil potatoes for 2 minutes until crusty and golden brown. Arrange potatoes around meat to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 11199,&quot;Duck Breast with Mustard Pan Sauce, Duck fat potatoes, Haricots Verts and Frisee 5 medium red potatoes, cut into quarters Kosher salt 1/4 pound haricots verts, trimmed Two 8-ounce duck breasts About 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for cooking 1 shallot, finely chopped 1/4 cup white wine 1/4 cup chicken stock 1 1/2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard Pinch crushed red pepper 3 sprigs fresh thyme 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 bunch frisee, loose, pulled from the core Instructions: Add the potatoes to a medium pot and cover with water. Add a few pinches of salt. Place on the stove and set to medium-high heat. Bring the potatoes to a low boil and cook until just tender when pierced with a fork, about 18 minutes. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and place in a colander or on a sheet pan lined with a towel to drain. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath and set aside. With the water at rolling boil, add the haricots verts and cook until tender but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove from the pot and immediately submerge in the ice bath to shock. Drain when ready to use, making sure they are very dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the fat in the duck breasts a couple times in two directions to create a crosshatch pattern. Cut through the fat but not into the meat of the breast. Salt the breasts and let sit outside the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes to allow them to come to room temperature. Add the olive oil to a large saute pan. Place the duck in the pan skin-side down. Bring the pan to medium heat and cook the duck breasts low and slow to allow the fat to render and the skin to get nice and crispy. As the fat renders out of the duck, pour or spoon it out of the pan and set it aside. Cook the duck for 8 to 9 minutes on the skin side. Turn the duck over and cook the duck for 2 to 3 minutes on the flesh side. Remove the duck from the pan, cover with foil and let rest for about 10 minutes. Add the shallots to the pan and cook until just translucent, about 3 minutes, adding a bit of the reserved duck fat if pan is too dry. Then, add the white wine, chicken stock and mustard. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let cook until the sauce has reduced by half and coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt and crushed red pepper. Meanwhile, add the remaining duck fat to a separate large saute pan (if the ducks were lean and there isn&#39;t enough fat to generously coat the pan, add a bit of olive oil) over medium-high heat. Add the thyme sprigs and potatoes, cut-side down and cook until they begin to brown on all sides, about 7 minutes. When potatoes are brown and crisp, remove from pan and set aside. Discard the thyme. Add the garlic and cook for a minute, making sure it doesn&#39;t brown. Add the drained haricots verts and saute with salt and crushed red pepper. Remove from the heat. Slice the duck breast thinly on the bias. Add a handful of frisee to plate or platter. Top with the potatoes and haricots verts, then the sliced duck breast and finally the pan sauce.

(You should have about 6 cups crumbs.) Remove the bread crumbs to a shallow pan and mix in 1/2 cup of the chopped parsley (reserving the remaining 1/4 cup for the crabcake mixture). Set aside. In a food processor, combine the egg yolk, lemon juice, Worcestershire, hot pepper, mustard, paprika, thyme, celery seeds, and black pepper and pulse to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream until the mixture emulsifies and forms a mayonnaise. Remove the mayonnaise from the food processor and refrigerate. Place the crabmeat in a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a bowl. Pull the cheesecloth tightly around the crabmeat and squeeze out as much juice as possible. Place the chopped onions and bell peppers in a sieve set over a bowl and use your hands to squeeze out as much juice as possible. In a large bowl, combine the onions and bell peppers with remaining 1/4 cup parsley. Add the chilled mayonnaise and crabmeat and toss lightly to combine. Add 1 cup of the bread crumbs-parsley mixture and combine. Do not overwork the mixture or the crabcakes may get gummy. Gently form 8 patties and roll the patties lightly in the remaining bread crumb-parsley mixture. Leave the crabcakes in the pan of the bread crumbs until you saute them. Preheat the oven to 425 degree. Using a nonstick saute pan and butter as needed, panfry the crabcakes, in batches, until golden brown on both sides and place them on a baking sheet as they are browned, put them in the oven until they are heated all the way through, 5 to 8 minutes. Serve 1 crabcake as an appetizer or 2 as an entree. Serve with a ramekin of cocktail sauce and a lemon wedge. Cook&#39;s Note: The crabcakes hold together better if prepared a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator before cooking. Store them in the pan of bread crumbs, covered with plastic wrap. Put the tomatillos in a food processor and process until coarsely pureed. Remove the tomatillo puree to a sieve, drain off the liquid, and discard. Put the drained puree in a small bowl and stir in the vinegar, sugar, pepper sauce, garlic, mustard seeds, and horseradish until combined.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs, adding the chopped Brussels sprouts and their leaves during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Reserve 11/2 cups cooking water, then drain. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel?lined plate, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings in the skillet. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, then add the squash, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook until the squash is lightly golden around the edges, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup of the reserved cooking water, cover and simmer until the squash is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the pasta, Brussels sprouts, bacon, scallions, the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/4 cup cooking water to the skillet; toss until coated, adding the remaining cooking water as needed to loosen.

Top each serving with the parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 11203,&quot;Gnocchi Parmesan with Tomato Coulis 1 cup milk 7 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup flour 4 eggs 1 1/2 cups Tomato Coulis (recipe follows) 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup (2 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese Chopped chives for garnish Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 small onion, thinly sliced 3 mushrooms, thinly sliced 2 shallots, thinly sliced 1 small leek, white part, thinly sliced 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon brandy 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon Madeira 1 cup chicken stock or canned broth 3 ripe tomatoes, chopped with skins 2 sprigs thyme 1 bay leaf Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Because you will need to cook the gnocchi quickly once the batter is ready, do the following before you begin the preparation. Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Have a large bowl of iced water nearby. Combine milk, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium-heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture is nearly solid, about 2 minutes. The batter should be the consistency of mashed potatoes and should clear the sides of the pan to form a ball. Remove from heat. Transfer to a large bowl and add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. (An electric mixer is fine for this.) The batter should be very thick, shiny, and smooth. Fill a pastry bag, fitted with a large plain tip #8, with batter. Holding pastry bag over simmering water, gently squeeze out dough, slicing into 1-inch lengths with a paring knife. Working in 4 batches of about 20 pieces, cook gnocchi at a slow simmer, stirring occasionally, until they start to puff, about 5 minutes. They should resemble floating corks. To test for doneness, remove a dumpling and cut in half. The center should have tiny bubbles. With a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to the bowl if iced water to cool. Drain well in a colander. At this stage, you can store gnocchi in refrigerator up to 2 days. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Bring Tomato Coulis and cream to a boil in a large ovenproof skillet or casserole. Add Parmesan, salt, pepper, and gnocchi. Return to a boil, sprinkle with cheese and transfer to oven. Bake until sauce is thick and bubbly and a slight crust forms on top, about 7 minutes. Garnish with chopped chives and serve immediately. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Cook onion, mushrooms, shallot, leek, and salt until soft, about 7 minutes. Add brandy and 1/4 cup Madeira. Turn heat to high and light alcohol with a match. Cook over high heat until liquid is reduced by half. Add chicken stock, tomatoes, thyme, and bay leaf. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Puree in a food processor or blender and strain. Return to pan and place over medium heat. Whisk in remaining tablespoon butter, broken in small pieces, and remaining tablespoon Madeira. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 11204,&quot;Green Pancake 1 cup milk or almond milk 3/4 cup lightly packed fresh soft herbs (any mix of parsley, basil, cilantro, fresh mint, dill, chives or scallions... whatever is leftover in your fridge), coarsely chopped<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Unsalted butter or oil, for cooking<br> Toppings, for serving (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: In a high-speed blender, combine the milk and herbs and blend until very smooth. Add the eggs, flour, olive oil, salt and a few turns of pepper and blend until smooth. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and coat with a little butter or oil. Pour in about 1/3 cup batter and cook until set on the bottom, about 2 minutes; you&#39;ll know it&#39;s ready to flip when it lifts easily off of the skillet. Flip and cook until set on the other side, about another minute. Top with desired toppings. If topping with cheese, it&#39;s best to sprinkle it on as soon as you flip the crepe over, so that it has time to get melty! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 11205,&quot;Hot White Russian 1 teaspoon sugar 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> Dash pure vanilla extract<br> 32 ounces freshly brewed hot strong coffee<br> 8 ounces coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua<br> 4 ounces vodka<br> Instructions: Whisk together the sugar and 1/4 cup cream in a medium bowl.

Whip the granulated sugar and eggs with a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Meanwhile, put the coffee, butter, vinegar and 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until the chocolate and butter are melted, about 3 minutes; then whisk together until well-blended. In a separate mixing bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt; whisk together. Add the oil and sour cream to the bowl with the chocolate mixture and mix well. Add a third of the flour mixture to the egg mixture and mix well to incorporate. Then mix in half of the chocolate mixture. Continue to alternate with the flour and chocolate mixtures, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally and finishing with the flour. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Fill each pan slightly below the top edge (you may not use all the batter). Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over the top of each. Bake until the centers bounce back when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. For the toffee sauce: Melt together the butter and brown sugar in a heavy saucepot and cook until simmering. Remove from the heat, then add the heavy cream and vanilla, and stir. Return to the heat and allow the sauce to boil for another 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour into a metal mixing bowl. Cool completely, then refrigerate. For the chocolate ganache: Place the chocolate chips, heavy cream and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 3 minutes. Stir until all the chocolate is melted and the ingredients are incorporated. Cool in the fridge until the consistency is like a paste. For the buttercream: Add the egg yolks to a mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer until light. In the meantime, mix the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Wet a pastry brush with water and wash down the sides of the pan to avoid crystallization. Continue to cook until the sugar syrup registers 235 degrees F (softball stage) on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat and, with your mixer running constantly at medium speed, immediately but slowly pour the hot sugar into the egg yolks in a steady stream. Continue to beat with the mixer until the mixture cools down completely. Add the butter, vanilla extract and vanilla bean seeds. Continue to beat until all of the butter is incorporated and the icing is smooth, glossy and spreadable (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add some buttercream to a pastry bag. To assemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate. With the pastry bag, pipe a border around the top edge of the cake layer for a \\frosting dam\\ to hold in the toffee sauce. Poke holes into the top of the cake layer and pour at least 1/4 cup toffee sauce (or more to taste) over the top so that it penetrates the cake. Then spread a thin layer (about 1/8-inch thick) of ganache over the top. Put in the freezer for 5 minutes to make the ganache solidify. Then spread a layer of buttercream over the top of the chilled ganache. Generously sprinkle some English toffee bits over the buttercream and drizzle with more toffee sauce and ganache. Place the second cake layer on top and ice with the buttercream. Drizzle the top with more ganache and toffee sauce, then sprinkle toffee bits over the top. Serve immediately or refrigerate, covered. Take out of the fridge 1 hour prior to serving, to bring to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 11216,&quot;Sausage Gravy 1 pound spicy breakfast sausage 1/2 cup instant/quick-mixing flour or all-purpose flour if not available<br> 1 quart chicken stock<br> 1 pint heavy cream<br> 1 quart half-and-half<br> Salt and pepper Instructions: In a heavy bottom pot, cook sausage until browned (do not drain fat).

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the cake flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt and set aside. In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy, then beat in the egg yolks and the vanilla. In a measuring jug, whisk the sour cream and the milk together until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and the sour cream mixture alternately to the creamed butter mixture, ending with the milk mixture. Fold in the egg whites, then pour into the prepared pan. Bake on the center rack of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then unmold onto a plate and continue cooling to room temperature. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to finish the cake. To make the almond praline: preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and the water over low heat. Stir together until the sugar has melted, then increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, then remove from the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine the sliced almonds with the sugar syrup and toss until well coated. With a slotted spoon, transfer the nuts to a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake until golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. Let the nuts cool and break them apart. The nuts should remain whole but be coated with a sugary golden coating. To make the chocolate mousse: chill a bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the freezer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a double boiler, melt the chocolates over simmering water and stir in the cinnamon. In the frozen mixing bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks (do not over beat). Remove the double boiler insert holding the melted chocolate from the pan. With a rubber spatula, fold 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate. Fold the remaining cold cream into the chocolate mixture, 1/4 at a time, mixing it as little as possible just to get it all incorporated. When ready to assemble the torte, cut the sour cream cake in half horizontally with a long sharp knife. Place 1 layer of the cake on a serving plate and spread a thick layer of mousse on top of it. Sandwich the second layer over the top and spread a mounded layer of mouse over the top. Spread a layer of mousse around the edges, covering the cake completely. Gently press the sugared almonds into the mousse evenly around the edges of the cake. Using a very sharp vegetable peeler, shave long thick curls of chocolate over the top of the cake and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 11229,&quot;Chicken and Dumplings 2 whole chickens (3 to 5 pounds each)<br> Unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 pounds unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Bones and juices from chicken 1/2 yellow onion, diced 1-ounce celery salt 1-ounce granulated onion 1-ounce granulated garlic 1-ounce black pepper Water, to cover 4 large eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 pound unsalted butter 2 cups all-purpose flour Instructions: For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cover and chill at least 2 hours. Make the sliders: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bun bottoms, cut-side down, and cook until golden; set aside. Melt 1 more tablespoon butter in the skillet and toast the bun tops until golden; set aside. Season the beef generously with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the beef and cook until browned but still pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. (You can also cook the tenderloin in one piece: Brown on all sides, then roast in a 425 degrees F oven, 10 to 15 minutes. Let rest, then slice into 12 pieces.) Assemble the sliders: Put a slice of beef on each bun bottom. Top each with a generous spoonful of the horseradish cream, some onion rings and a bun top. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 11254,&quot;Easy Beefy Cheesy Enchilada Casserole 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 cup minced onion Kosher salt 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 3/4 cup beef broth 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup chopped onion 1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped yellow bell pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 1/2 pounds ground beef 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 packet Spanish seasoning blend (recommended: Sazon) 2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped 1/4 cup beef broth Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese 1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese 18 (5-inch) corn tortillas Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350degrees F. For the sauce: In a saucepot over medium heat, add the oil, onions and a pinch of salt. Saute until the onions are tender and translucent. Add the tomato paste at this point and turn the heat up a bit, if needed, to cook the paste. Stir and cook until it deepens in color, and then add the cumin, thyme and garlic. Stir to blend and cook until fragrant. Then add the beef broth and crushed tomatoes. Raise the heat to bring the mixture to a boil, and then lower to a simmer and cover, simmering for 20 minutes more. (The sauce can be stored and frozen at this point.) For the beef filling: Meanwhile, in a large pan with straight sides, add the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to swirl, add the onions and green and yellow bell peppers. Add the garlic and cook until tender, about 4 minutes more. Add the ground beef, broth, cumin, onion powder, thyme, tomatoes and Spanish seasoning, allowing time between each addition to blend. Season with a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper (the Spanish seasoning adds salt content, so be careful to not over season). Stir and break down the beef into bits using a spoon or fork. Cook until the beef is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. (The beef can be stored and frozen at this point.) To assemble the casserole: Toss the shredded cheeses together to blend and set aside. Add 1/2 cup of the red sauce to a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish baking dish and spread to coat the bottom evenly. Top with 6 tortillas, overlapping to cover the bottom of the casserole dish. Layer the dish by next adding half of the beef mixture and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheeses, spreading evenly in the casserole. Next, dunk 6 tortillas, one by one, in the warm red sauce and layer over the cheese and beef, overlapping where needed. Top with the remaining beef, another 1/2 cup of the shredded cheeses and another layer of tortillas dunked in the red sauce. Pour the rest of the sauce over the top, spread evenly and finish with the remaining shredded cheese. Place dish on a baking sheet and bake until the cheese is melted and the sauce bubbles, 25 to 30 minutes. If baking the dish from the freezer, add 15 to 20 minutes to the cook time, or until it&#39;s bubbly. Cover loosely with foil if it&#39;s browning too quickly. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 11255,&quot;New York Strip Steaks with Grilled Fennel Salad and Paprika Butter 2 heads roasted garlic 3 anchovy fillets 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 2 tablespoons sweet paprika 2 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves striped from the stem 4 New York strip steaks, 10-ounces each Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 handfuls fresh rosemary 2 handfuls fresh thyme 4 small fennel bulbs, tops removed, sliced into 1-inch rings Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon 1/2 cup pitted green Spanish olives 1/4 bunch fresh basil Pinch red pepper flakes 1 teaspoon ground coriander Instructions: Mash the roasted garlic and anchovies on a cutting board with the flat side of a knife to make a paste. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add the paprika, thyme leaves, and the mashed garlic mixture. Mix until the ingredients are well blended and the butter is red; set aside at room temperature.<br> Rub both sides of the steaks with oil, season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Put the steaks on a large platter and toss the rosemary and thyme on top. Drizzle with a bit more olive oil and cover with plastic. Allow the steaks to marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel then carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill; this will create a non-stick grilling surface. Grill the steaks about 7 minutes per side for medium-rare.<br> While the steaks are working, put the fennel rings in a bowl and drizzle with a healthy dose of olive oil; add the juice of 1/2 of a lemon. Put the fennel on the free side of the grill and grill for 5 minutes per side. Take everything off the grill; let the steak rest while you put the salad together. Put the grilled fennel in a bowl and add the remaining salad ingredients: the olives, basil, red pepper flakes, coriander, and remaining lemon juice. Drizzle with another dose of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and give the salad a good toss. This salad is best when the fennel is still warm, so lather the steak with the paprika butter and serve it with the salad as soon as possible. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 11256,&quot;Corn with cl Lime Butter 1/2 pound unsalted butter, softened 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro 2 tablespoons rocoto cl paste 1 teaspoon ground cumin Salt and pepper 4 ears fresh corn Instructions: Preheat grill on high.

Add the chicken breasts, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Leaving chicken in the liquid, allow to cool. When cool, remove the chicken. Bone and shred the chicken breasts and return to the liquid. Set aside. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Heat the oil in a skillet. Pass the tortillas, one at a time, quickly through the oil, about 10 seconds per side. Place tortillas between paper towels to absorb excess oil. To assemble, put about 1/12th of the shredded chicken on each tortilla, sprinkling 1 teaspoon of the simmering liquid on top. Spread one tablespoon of the Salsa Verde over the chicken. Roll the tortilla around the chicken and sauce and place in a greased ceramic or glass casserole. Continue with the rest of the tortillas and filling until the entire filling is used up. Pour 3/4 of the remaining salsa verde over the enchiladas. Sprinkle with the grated cheese. Bake for 5 minutes then, check the progress. Continue baking until sauce begins to bubble, which may mean an additional 5 minutes. Top with sour cream when serving. Serve remaining salsa verde at the table. Note: Salsa verde can be made in advance and refrigerated for 3 to 4 days. Warm the refrigerated sauce before assembling the enchiladas. For the sauce, clean the thin dry skins off the tomatillos. Boil all the ingredients together until soft, about 10 minutes. Cool for 30 minutes then, puree in a food processor. This should yield about 3 cups; if sauce seems too thick, thin with chicken stock to pourable paste consistency. Set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Rioja]&quot; 11259,&quot;Roast Beef and Camembert Panini with Arugula Aioli 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 bay leaf 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 cup mayonnaise 2 cups packed arugula<br> 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br> Kosher salt 8 slices sourdough bread One 8-ounce wheel Brie, thinly sliced<br> 1/2 pound sliced roast beef<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Instructions: For the caramelized onions: Place a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil and butter and heat until the butter melts. Add the onions, thyme sprigs, bay leaf and garlic. Sprinkle the onion mixture with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and golden brown, 45 minutes. For the arugula aioli: Meanwhile, add the mayonnaise, arugula, lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt to the carafe of a high-speed blender. Blend on high speed until it becomes a smooth sauce that is vibrant green in color, about 30 seconds. Set aside for sandwich assembly or store, refrigerated, in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. For the panini: Lay 2 pieces of bread out on a work surface. Spread each piece of bread with 1 tablespoon of arugula aioli. Place 3 slices of Brie on 1 piece of bread. Layer the roast beef over the Brie. Spread 3 tablespoons of caramelized onions over the beef. Close the sandwich with the other piece of bread, aioli facing in. Repeat this process to assemble 3 more sandwiches. Place a large saute pan over medium heat. Gather a piece of parchment paper and a cast-iron pan to use as a weight on top of the sandwiches. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil into the pan, followed by 2 sandwiches. Lay the parchment over the sandwiches and cover with the cast-iron pan. Gently press the cast iron into the sandwiches and cook until the bread is golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes. Remove the cast-iron pan and parchment and flip the sandwiches over. Replace the parchment and cast-iron pan and cook the sandwiches until the bread is toasted and the cheese begins to melt, about 2 minutes more. Remove the sandwiches from the pan and repeat this process with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and 2 sandwiches. Cut each panini in half to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11260,&quot;Flank Steak with Watermelon Salad 1/4 cup grapeseed oil 1/4 cup white vinegar 1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro 1 teaspoon garlic paste 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Juice of 2 limes 1 jalapeno, sliced One 2-pound flank steak 1/4 cup white vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup cherry tomatoes, cut in half 1 cup medium-dice seedless watermelon 4 fresh mint leaves, thin sliced or chiffonade Grapeseed oil, for frying 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 small onion, sliced in thin rings and soaked in ice water Salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh cilantro sprigs, for garnish Instructions: For the flank steak and marinade: Whisk together the grapeseed oil, white vinegar, cilantro, garlic, salt, pepper, lime juice and jalapenos in a medium bowl. Put the flank steak in large casserole pan, pour over the marinade and marinate, refrigerated, overnight. For the watermelon salad: Mix together the vinegar, honey and sugar in a bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Whisk in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes, watermelon and mint and toss with the vinaigrette. For the onion rings: Heat the oil in a heavy pan until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Put the flour in a medium bowl. Drain the onion rings completely, and then toss in the flour to coat. Tap off any excess flour, and then fry the onions until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel, and then season lightly with salt and pepper. To cook the flank steak, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, draining off any excess. (Removal of excess marinade will prevent flaming or charring of the steak during cooking.) Grill over high heat until medium rare, 8 to 9 minutes per side. Allow the steak to rest before slicing against the grain into thin slices. Shingle some sliced steak on each plate. Spoon the watermelon salad on top. Garnish with onion rings and cilantro sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 11261,&quot;Fried Quince Empanadas 3 large ripe plantains, unpeeled 5 large ripe quince Juice of 1 lemon 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 cup light brown sugar 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger Zest and juice of 1 orange 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup dark rum 1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon salt Vegetable oil for deep frying Powdered sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Meanwhile, make the stuffing: Peel, core and finely chop 3 of the quinces. Peel and core the remaining 2 quinces and cut each into 8 wedges. Drop the wedges into a bowl of cold water to cover and squeeze in the lemon juice. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Add the brown sugar and cook, stirring, until the sugar has melted. Add the finely chopped quinces, ginger, orange zest, cloves and cinnamon and stir to combine. Add 1 cup of water and continue cooking until most of the liquid is gone, about 15 minutes. Add the orange juice and rum and cook until almost all of the liquid is gone, about 5 minutes. Drain the quince wedges and add to the pan. Reduce the heat, cover and cook until the wedges are just soft, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the walnuts and let cool. (The stuffing can be make a day in advance and refrigerated). Make the dough in a food processor with a paddle attachment: Peel, trim and discard any tough ends from the plantains. Combine the plantains and salt and pulse until a smooth puree is formed, or mix until just blended. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate about 2 hours. To assemble: Roll 2 tablespoons of the dough between your palms to form a ball. Line the bottom of a tortilla press with a small plastic bag and place the ball of dough in the center. Place another plastic bag over the dough and press to form a 3 1/2inch circle. Place a quince wedge on half of the dough circle and top it with a teaspoon of the sauce.

Toss the pork cubes with the salt and pepper and half of the oregano in a bowl. Place the porcini mushrooms in a small bowl just large enough to accommodate them and pour the hot water over the top; let stand for 30 minutes to rehydrate. Meanwhile, place an enameled 6-quart Dutch oven or other heavy, oven-safe pot over medium heat on the stovetop. Add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the seasoned pork cubes, working in 2 batches so as to not crowd the pot. Cook on all sides, turning once, until the pieces have begun to brown lightly. Set aside the browned pork cubes in a bowl. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook until softened and lightly caramelized, adding olive oil if bottom of pan becomes too dry. Add the garlic and continue to cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine to the pot to deglaze, scraping loose any browned bits. Add the porcini mushrooms and their liquid (be sure to prevent the sediment at the bottom of the bowl from pouring in), the broth, tomato sauce, bay leaf and remaining oregano and stir to incorporate. Return the pork to the pot and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Place the pot in the oven and cook for 2 1/2 hours. Remove the pork and check for tenderness. If the pork is not fork-tender, return to the oven and continue to braise for another 30 to 45 minutes. Let cool slightly and taste for seasonings. For the cavatelli pasta: Place the flour on a smooth work surface and add 1 teaspoon salt, stirring lightly with a fork to incorporate. Form the small pile of flour into a ring with room in middle to accommodate the eggs. Dump the eggs and yolks into the middle of the ring. Stir the eggs slowly with a fork to mix, then continuing with the fork, draw the flour into the eggs a little at a time, working the pile in a circular motion to bring the dough together without breaking the ring. Once the pasta dough has started to form, knead the dough, rolling and turning the ball until a smooth and silky dough is achieved. Wrap the pasta dough tightly in plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. Lightly dust a work surface with semolina flour. Take the dough ball and roll it out to a 1-inch thickness. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch-thick slices and roll out to a 1/4-inch thickness. Run the long strips through the cavatelli machine to shape. Depending on your type of machine, the thickness of the long strips may vary slightly. The pasta can then be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days or cooked immediately. Boil a large pot of water over high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon salt and 6 cups of the pasta. Cook until slightly chewy, approximately 5 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. For the sauce verde: Place olive oil, spinach, capers, lemon juice, pepper and parsley in a tall, slender container, such as a pitcher, and blend on high speed using an immersion blender until the sauce has the consistency of a thick paste, about 1 minute. To prepare the dish for plating, reheat the braised pork over medium heat. When the pork is steaming hot, add the cooked pasta. Allow the pork and pasta to cook another 2 to 3 minutes. If the sauce thickens too much, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water 1/4 cup at a time until you reach your desired consistency. Evenly divide the pork and pasta among 6 to 8 bowls. Spoon 1 tablespoon sauce verde over each bowl and top with a liberal grating of cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 11300,&quot;Tra Vigne&#39;s Unscotti (once baked) 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surfaces 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon gray salt 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2/3 cup crystal sugar plus more to roll logs in (see Chef&#39;s Note) 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 5 large eggs 6 tablespoons anise seeds 1 cup unblanched whole almonds, toasted Instructions: Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and crystal sugar until light and fluffy. Add brown sugar while mixing. Add the eggs, flour mixture, and anise seeds. Beat on low just until the dough begins to come together. Add the almonds and mix just until distributed. Do not overwork. On a floured board, shape the dough into a log, flatten, put on a baking sheet, and chill for 2 hours to allow the dough to relax. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions on a lightly floured work surface. Using your hands, roll each portion into a log about 3 inches in diameter. Top generously with crystal sugar. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet and press down lightly to flatten slightly. Logs should be several inches apart. Bake until firm and light brown, about 1 hour or more. When poked with a finger, the dough should feel firm to the touch and not collapse or cave in. Remove from the oven. Let the logs cool completely before serving. Variation : Try substituting 1/2 cup of cacao nibs for 1/2 a cup of almonds. They&#39;ll add a subtle chocolate flavor. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 11301,&quot;No-Bake Peanut Butter, Chocolate and Pretzel Bars 12 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup graham cracker crumbs<br> 1 cup confectioners\\u2019 sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter<br> 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips<br> About 1 1/2 cups pretzel sticks<br> Instructions: Line an 8- or 9- inch square baking pan with foil. Melt 8 tablespoons of the butter and add to a large bowl. Add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, vanilla and 1 cup of peanut butter and stir until well combined. Transfer the peanut butter mixture to the prepared baking pan and smooth with an offset spatula to create an even layer. Combine the chocolate chips, the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and the remaining tablespoon peanut butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until melted. Alternatively, this can be done over a double boiler. Pour the chocolate mixture over the peanut butter and smooth with an offset spatula. Arrange the pretzel sticks on the surface of the chocolate, pressing them lightly to adhere. Refrigerate until hardened, about 1 1/2 hours.

Cook over high heat until syrup reaches 248 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Watch it closely as it gets close to temperature; it will go quickly at the end. While syrup is cooking, beat egg whites with 2 tablespoons sugar until stiff but not dry.* (Extra- fine granulated sugar works best). Turn mixer off until syrup is ready. With mixer running, pour syrup into the egg whites in a thin, steady stream, making sure not to pour directly onto beaters. Be careful, as hot syrup can burn if you. Continue to beat mixture until it is no longer hot. Allow to cool to room temperature and then beat in the softened butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all is incorporated. (Salted butter works fine. If you are using unsalted butter, add 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste.) The mixture will become thin and may look curdled at first, but will then become smooth as it beats. Lastly, beat in the vanilla all at once. (Use the best vanilla you can find. Artificial and white \\vanilla\\ will ruin the delicate flavor.) If not using at once, refrigerate the buttercream until needed. It will keep for 1 week in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. To use, just bring it back to room temperature and re-beat to restore the texture. If you have trouble with the texture, getting it to room temperature and extra beating are the keys to making it smooth.

Whisk together and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Add the peppermint extract and egg and beat until combined. Add the flour/cocoa mixture in 2 or 3 batches, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the chopped mints. Place the dough into a large ziptop bag and flatten slightly with your hand. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest in the bag at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. For rolling: Mix the flour and cocoa powder in a bowl, then tip it out onto the counter. Remove the dough from the bag and put it on the flour/cocoa mixture. Roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/3 inch. Cut with fun-shaped cookie cutters and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. You&#39;ll need to consolidate and re-roll the dough as you go. Bake until set, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. For the royal icing: Beat the powdered sugar, milk and egg white with a mixer in a large bowl until thick and glossy. Add more powdered sugar if the icing seems too thin (the size of the egg can affect consistency). Just play with it until it&#39;s right. The icing should be stiff enough to \\stand still\\ when piped and not run. To decorate: Transfer the royal icing to a piping bag and swirl the icing onto the cookies to decorate them.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the noodles and drizzle them with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and then set the noodles aside for later use. (If you are using no-boil noodles, skip this step.) Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet set over medium heat and cook the shallots until softened and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add in the garlic and zucchini, and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted, 2 to 4 minutes. In a large bowl, stir to combine the ricotta, Parmesan, salt, pepper and egg, and set aside for a later use. To assemble the lasagna, spoon 1/2 cup of the Chunky Marinara Sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Top with 5 noodles, slightly overlapping. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then add one-third of the cooked zucchini and spinach, evenly distributing over the ricotta. Top with 2 cups of the mozzarella, then top with 1 cup of the sauce. Repeat the layering two more times, ending with a layer of noodles and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until bubbling and cooked through, 10 to 20 minutes more. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat and add the carrots, celery and onions, and cook until soft and translucent, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the oregano, cl flakes, tomato puree, chopped tomatoes and their juices, basil leaves and some salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 11311,&quot;Caprese French Bread Pizzas 1/4 cup pine nuts 1 cup fresh basil, plus more for garnish<br> 2/3 cup olive oil<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper 1 small Italian or French bread loaf<br> 12 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced<br> 1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved<br> 1 tablespoon balsamic glaze<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

With a sharp knife, cut 1-inch-deep incisions all along the length of the fish on each side of the backbone. Cut 1/2-inch-deep incisions into the fillets at 1-inch intervals perpendicular to the fish&#39;s length. Season the fish all over, including the incisions and its cavity, with salt and pepper. Put 4 of the fennel branches in the body cavity. Spread 2 of the sliced fennel bulbs, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes on a rimmed metal baking sheet. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and the red pepper flakes. Drizzle generously with olive oil. Place the fish on top of the vegetables, body cavity down, and drizzle it generously with olive oil. Pour half of the wine over the fish and vegetables. Place the baking sheet on top of the stove over 2 burners set to medium-high heat. As soon as the liquid in the baking sheet starts to steam, transfer the baking sheet to the preheated oven. Roast the fish, basting it occasionally with the juices from the pan, until its flesh easily separates from the bone when 1 of the incisions is probed with the side of the basting spoon, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium-high heat, heat about 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the shallots and chopped fennel bulb and saute until translucent but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the Pernod, which may flare up as its alcohol burns, and then pour in the remaining white wine and stir and scrape to deglaze the pan deposits. Simmer briskly until the liquid has reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Whisking continuously, add the butter to the pan 1 or 2 pieces at a time until it melts, forming a thick, creamy sauce. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and stir in the lemon juice. Pour the sauce through a fine strainer held over another saucepan, and press down on the solids with the back of a wooden spoon to press out all the liquid. Finely chop the fronds of the remaining fennel branch, stir all but a tablespoon or so of them into the sauce, and adjust the seasonings, to taste. Keep the sauce warm over low heat. Use a pair of large spatulas to transfer the fish to a serving platter. Arrange the roasted vegetables around the fish and drizzle with 1 or 2 spoonfuls of the sauce over it. Garnish the platter with lemons and parsley, drizzle the fish with a little more olive oil, and serve, passing the sauce separately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 11314,&quot;Tangerine Champagne 1 part tangerine juice 1 part Champagne, or other sparkling wine of choice Blueberries, for garnish Instructions: In a Champagne glass, pour in the tangerine juice and Champagne.

When the chickpeas and beans are ready, drain them and transfer to separate 2-quart saucepans, cover with cold water by 3 inches and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour, then drain. If the water comes below the beans before they\\u2019re completely cooked, add more water to cover. When the chickpeas and beans are almost ready, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to get golden and soften, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the turmeric and 2 teaspoons salt and stir to combine. Add the cooked chickpeas and beans and 6 cups water and bring to a simmer. Stir in the lentils, spinach, parsley and cilantro, then simmer, covered, until the lentils are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and the dried mint to a small skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mint starts shimmering and sizzling, about 5 minutes. When the lentils are ready, add the mint mixture and reshteh to the pot. Stir together and bring to a simmer, then cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are soft, but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. The soup should be thick, similar to chili (see Cook\\u2019s Note). If it\\u2019s too thick, add 1/2 cup water and simmer 5 minutes more. If the finished soup looks watery, mix 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour with 1/3 cup water, then stir it in and simmer until the soup thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. For serving: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the turmeric and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes more. Set the onions aside. Heat another 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Set the garlic aside. Combine the dried mint and remaining 2 tablespoons oil and 1/2 teaspoon turmeric in a small skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook until the mint becomes shimmery, toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Set the mint aside. Ladle the ash reshteh into a large tureen or individual bowls and top as you like with Kashk and the reserved onions, garlic and mint. Scoop the yogurt into a large pot and add 2 cups water. Whisk until the water is fully incorporated and there are no lumps. Place the pot over medium heat and stir constantly until the yogurt comes to a boil, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the yogurt is pretty thick and has lightly splattering bubbles, about 1 1/2 hours. The yogurt will separate and most of the water should be evaporated. Raise the heat to medium-high and stir constantly until the mixture is quite thick and lumpy and the color is light beige, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 20 minutes. Pour the kashk into a nut-milk bag and squeeze out and discard as much liquid as possible; you want to end up with dry pulp. Place the kashk in a blender, add 1/2 cup water and blend on high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add an additional 1 tablespoon water if needed to create a smooth consistency similar to mayonnaise. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt and blend to incorporate. The kashk should taste somewhat salty and sour. Add more salt, if needed. The kashk will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for up to 5 days. Stir before using. You can also freeze the kashk for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator, then stir before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 11318,&quot;Manali Unripe Peach and Chick-Peas with Fennel 1/3 cup mustard oil or light vegetable oil 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds 3/4 teaspoon fennel seeds 3 tablespoons shredded fresh ginger 1 1/2 cups minced onions 5 hot chilies, chopped 1 1/2 tablespoons ground coriander 2 tablespoons ground almonds 1 pound unripe hard peaches (or nectarines), peeled, pitted and sliced thickly 1 1/2 cups cooked chick-peas (20 ounces), drained 1 teaspoon mango powder (or 1 tablespoon lemon juice) 1/2 teaspoon garam masala, recipe follows Coarse salt to taste Instructions: Measure out the spices in separate containers and set aside.

Bring liquid to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer. Cover pan with lid or with aluminum foil; transfer to oven and cook 3 hours, checking occasionally to make sure liquid is gently simmering. Remove veal from pan to a cutting board and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Taste braising liquid: if it needs to be intensified, season well with salt and pepper and boil over high heat until reduced and flavorful. Discard veal bones. Remove strings and slice veal breast in 1/2-inch slices. Serve veal, sauce and braising vegetables, with garlicky potatoes or rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 11325,&quot;Sausage and Gravy Biscuit Sandwiches 1 roll breakfast sausage, cut into eight 3/4-inch slices 1 tablespoon butter 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup whole milk Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives 8 Grapevine KY Buttermilk Biscuits, recipe follows, warmed, or your favorite biscuit Honey, for drizzling 4 cups self-rising flour, plus more for dusting 1 stick good butter, plus 3 tablespoons melted 2 to 3 cups cold buttermilk 1 tablespoon vegetable oil Instructions: Heat a skillet to medium heat and brown sausage until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes a side. Reserve the fat in the pan and set aside the sausage. Add the butter to reserved fat and melt. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Whisk in the flour and cook until blonde, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk and some salt and pepper, and simmer until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. When ready to serve, stir in the chopped chives. For the sandwich build: With a fork, carefully split a hot Grapevine KY Buttermilk Biscuit in half. On the bottom biscuits, drizzle some honey, and then place the sausage patties delightfully on top. Slather on some gravy and top with the other biscuit half -- simple, yet mind blowing. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a heavy cast-iron skillet (preferably 12 inch) into the oven to preheat. Chill a large mixing bowl, pastry cutter, the flour and 1 stick of the butter in the freezer 15 minutes before assembling the biscuits. Add the flour to the chilled mixing bowl. Working quickly, cut 1 stick of the butter into the flour using the chilled pastry cutter (or your fingers); the goal here is pea-size balls of butter. In batches, add in the buttermilk until the dough is cohesive yet still moist. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press into a 1-inch-thick round. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or the business end of a dry measuring cup, cut out 10 biscuits. (Use the extra dough to cook up a big piece of shortcake for dessert....strawberry shortcake!) Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and add the oil. Place the dough rounds into the hot skillet, right up against each other, and brush with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 11326,&quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Celebration Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pans 1 cup unsalted roasted hazelnuts 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 cup milk 1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs 3/4 cup hot coffee 4 cups powdered sugar 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract A good pinch of kosher salt 1/4 cup heavy cream Mustard yellow food coloring Dusty rose pink food coloring Marzipan kneaded with food coloring and cut into cute shapes (we\\u2019re making houses) Crushed unsalted roasted hazelnuts Green sprinkles, optional Orange sprinkles, optional Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease four 6-inch-round, 3-inch-tall cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment. Put the hazelnuts in a food processor and grind them until you have small crumbs. Measure out 1/4 cup of the hazelnut crumbs and set them aside for the frosting. Pour the remaining hazelnut crumbs into a large bowl and whisk in the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, oil, vanilla and eggs. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and then stir in the hot coffee. It will be a very thin batter. Pour into the prepared cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Begin checking for doneness at 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them onto a greased cooling rack. For the frosting: While the cakes are cooling, use an electric mixer to beat together the powdered sugar, butter, vanilla and salt until smooth. Mix in the heavy cream until smooth. Scoop out a tiny amount of frosting for the mustard-colored dollops, add the mustard yellow food coloring and mix until combined. Transfer the yellow frosting to a piping bag with a small round tip. To the remaining frosting, add the dusty rose pink food coloring and mix until the desired shade of pink. Measure out 1 cup of the pink frosting and transfer it to a small bowl. Fold in the reserved 1/4 cup ground hazelnuts. Level your cake layers and spread the top of one of them with the hazelnutty frosting. Place a second layer on top, then frost the top with more of the hazelnutty frosting. Continue with the remaining 2 layers. Frost the top and sides with the remaining pink frosting without nuts. For the decorations: Decorate with mustard dollops of frosting around the edge. Add marzipan house cutouts of white houses with green shutters, crushed hazelnuts, green grass sprinkles, orange sun sprinkles or whatever else you&#39;d like! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 11327,&quot;Bamboo Leaf Purple and White Potato Salad 1 1/2 pounds purple potatoes, cut into mini-potato size 1 1/2 pounds mini white potatoes 12 bamboo leaves, soaked overnight in water 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 cups fresh basil leaves, picked and torn 5 tablespoons almond oil 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, cracked 2 teaspoons white truffle oil Turmeric Goat Yogurt Sauce, for serving, recipe follows Finely grated zest of 2 lemons, for garnish Green onions, finely sliced, for garnish<br> 5 tablespoons goat milk yogurt 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric Pinch kosher salt Pinch cracked black peppercorns 1 clove garlic, pureed Instructions: Preheat the grill to 400 degrees F using hickory lump charcoal.

Cook the shrimp: In a large skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon garlic, and red pepper flakes, and cook for 30 seconds. Add the broth and lemon juice, and cook until it bubbles. Add the shrimp, season with salt and pepper, give it a good stir, and cook until the shrimp is pink and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the parsley. Serve immediately, spooning the shrimp and sauce over the Pesto Couscous. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 11346,&quot;Iced Citrus Crackle Cookie 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1 1/4 cups sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated citrus zest (Meyer or regular lemon, tangerine or lime) 2 large egg yolks, room temperature 3/4 teaspoon lemon extract (or use all orange extract for tangerine cookies) 1/4 teaspoon orange extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 2 tablespoons colored sanding sugar (yellow, orange or green, depending on the flavor of the cookie) 1 tablespoon finely grated citrus zest (the same flavor of the cookie) 2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed citrus juice (the same flavor of the cookie) Instructions: Evenly space the oven racks in the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. on the convection setting, if available. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Beat the butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high heat until smooth. Add the sugar and citrus zest and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. (The creaming is important to get a great texture so don&#39;t skimp here.) Add the yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the extracts. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt together in a bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, mixing at low speed to make a soft dough. Scoop the dough into rounded heaping tablespoons with a cookie scoop or measuring spoon. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the prepared pans. Freeze for at least 30 minutes. (The cookies can be frozen for up to 1 month.) Bake the cookies, straight from the freezer, until edges are firm and bottoms are lightly browned, 15 to 17 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. For icing: Mix the confectioners&#39; sugar, colored sugar and appropriate flavored zest in a medium bowl. Add the citrus juice and mix with an electric mixer to make a firm but pourable icing. (If needed, add up to 1 teaspoon more juice, but keep in mind that if the icing is too loose it won&#39;t set.) Dip the rounded side of the cooled cookies into the icing; then let the excess icing fall back into the bowl. Dry cookies icing side up on a rack. Serve. Store in an airtight container for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 11347,&quot;Fruit-Stacked Sticks 1/2 cored fresh pineapple from the produce department, available in sacks or tubs 1 seedless navel oranges or Sicilian blood oranges 8 strawberries, hulled (remove the greens and the tiny tops where fruit attached to vine using a small paring knife) 4-inch skewers 3/4 cup sugar 3/4 cup water 1 lemon, zested 1 lime, zested Instructions: Cut pineapple half lengthwise.

Place the pepper in a roasting pan and roast in the oven, checking every 15 minutes, and turning with tongs until the skin is fully wrinkled and charred black. When the peppers is done, use tongs to put it into a ziptop bag which (for safety reasons) you have resting on a plate - (Remember, it is volcanically hot!). Carefully zip the bag shut, and allow the pepper to sweat for 5 minutes. Use oven mitts to prevent getting burned while you handle the bag in the next step of sliding the pepper from the bag into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. You can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skin of the pepper while it is in the water. You will be left with a beautifully cooked red pepper with a wonderful color. Cut open the pepper and remove seeds. Slice it into strips and set aside. Roll out each puff pastry sheet and on the surface of each of the 2 sheets evenly arrange 4 slices of prosciutto ham, 6 spinach leaves, half of the red pepper strips, 1/8-cup Cheddar, and 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Roll up the dough \\jelly roll\\ style into a log (so the cross-section of the roll will be a spiral design, the \\pinwheel). Place the logs in the freezer for 50 minutes.

Add the onions and bring to a medium heat. Add a generous pinch of salt and a small pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until the onions look wilted and cooked but do not have any color. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and 3/4 of a can of water, and season with salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Taste, it should taste good. Bring a pot of water to a boil over medium heat and season it generously with salt. It should taste like the ocean. Add the cauliflower, let the water come to a rolling boil and cook the cauliflower for an additional 5 to 7 minutes. When done it should be really soft and almost falling apart. Strain the cauliflower and add it to the tomato mixture. Cook the cauliflower in the tomato sauce until the cauliflower has completely broken up and the sauce clings to the cauliflower, about 20 to 30 minutes. Taste to see if the seasoning needs to be adjusted. Stir in the lemon zest, olives and caperberries. Reserve. (This can totally be done ahead, it actually gets better when it IS done ahead. But it is still really good when made to order.) For the fish: Preheat the grill to medium and brush with oil if needed to remove any food particles. Pat the fish skin dry to make sure it is really dry. If you have time, let it hang out to dry for a few minutes before you grill it. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt on both sides. Put the fish, skin side down, on the preheated grill. Cook the fish for 2 to 3 minutes and then rotate the fish 90 degrees to create crisscross grill marks. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes and then turn the fish over and cook for another 2 minutes. To assemble: Reheat the cauliflower if it was done ahead. Serve the fish on serving plates, leaning on a mound of the cauliflower. In a small bowl toss the parsley with the lemon juice, salt and big fat drizzle of finishing oil. Garnish the fish with the parsley salad and more finishing oil, if desired.

Line baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly spray with nonstick baking spray. Whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a small bowl and set aside. Combine the butter, oil, and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat using the paddle attachment and until light and fluffy. Add the egg and fresh ginger and beat until combined. Combine the molasses and buttermilk in a measuring glass. Add the flour mixture and buttermilk/molasses mixture alternately in 2 batches, starting and ending with the flour, and mix until just combined. Remove the bowl from the stand and fold in the crystallized ginger. Cover and refrigerate the batter for 20 minutes. Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop 6 mounds batter onto a baking sheet, spacing the mounds about 3 inches apart. Bake until the cakes just spring back when touched (should be ever so slightly under-baked because the cakes will continue to bake on the hot baking sheets), about 10 minutes. Remove to a baking rack and let sit on the sheet pan for 5 minutes. Remove from the baking sheets and let cool completely on a baking rack, about 10 minutes. For the filling: Bring a medium pot with 1-inch water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat so that the water is at a bare simmer. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the egg whites, lemon juice, water, sugar, zest, cream of tartar and salt and whisk until combined and slightly foamy, about 1 minute. Place the bowl over the simmering water and stir with a rubber spatula until it reaches 160 degrees F, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the water and place it on the mixer stand. Using the whisk attachment, beat the mixture at high speed until it forms, stiff peaks and is cool, about 7 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and beat for 10 seconds longer. Remove from the stand and gently fold in the lemon curd then molasses, leaving streaks of curd and molasses in the filling. Place a large dollop of the filling on the center of the flat side of half the cakes. Top with the flat side of the remaining cakes and gently press until the filling spreads to the edge of the cake.

Stem them open. Strain the broth; you should have 4 cups of broth (and 1 pound of mussel meat). Cover the shelled mussels and keep refrigerated until ready to use. Heat a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced salt pork. Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the salt pork is a crisp golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cracklings to a small ovenproof dish, leaving the fat in the pot, and reserve until later. Add the butter, ginger, garlic, bell pepper, onion, curry powder, and cayenne pepper to the pot and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 10 minutes, until the pepper and onion are softened but not browned. Add the white potatoes and the reserved mussel broth, turn up the heat, and bring to a boil. Cover and cook the potatoes vigorously for 5 minutes. Add the sweet potatoes. The broth should just barely cover the potatoes; if it doesn&#39;t, add enough water to cover. Lower the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes longer, until the white and sweet potatoes are soft on the outside but still firm in the center. If the broth hasn&#39;t thickened lightly, smash a few potatoes and sweet potatoes against the side of the pot and cook a minute or two longer to release their starch. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the mussels and cream. Mussels are not as salty as clams, but you will still need to exercise a light hand as you season the chowder with salt. Add black pepper to taste. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely. Otherwise, let it sit at room temperature for up to an hour, allowing the flavors to meld. When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat; don&#39;t let it boil. Warm the cracklings in a low oven (200 degrees F) for a few minutes. Ladle the chowder into cups or bowls, making sure that the mussels, bell pepper, onion, and potatoes are evenly divided. Scatter the cracklings over the individual servings and sprinkle with the chopped cilantro and scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 11363,&quot;Chocolate Dipped Apricot Balls 1 pound dried apricots 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts 1 tablespoon hazelnut or orange-flavored liqueur Confectioners&#39; sugar for dredging 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped Instructions: In a food processor chop fine the apricots and hazelnuts and mix in enough of the liqueur to hold the mixture together.

Mix the lard, salt, flour and baking powder with the fresh or reconstituted masa, kneading it until all ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. If necessary, add a little water to correct the consistency of the dough (the dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small ball of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack). Divide into 12 pieces, place them on a plate and cover with plastic wrap. Set a griddle or heavy skillet over medium low heat. Place a 7 inch square of heavy plastic (like that used for freezer bags) on the counter and flatten a piece of masa onto it. Pat and press the dough into a 4 inch diameter circle about 1/8 inch thick. With the sambuta still attached to the plastic, flip it over onto one hand, dough side down, then carefully peel off the plastic. Lay the sambuta on the heated griddle and bake, turning over every minute or so, until it is lightly browned and crusty, about 3 or 4 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, then form and bake the remaining 11 sambutas in the same way. Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil to 375 degrees in a large heavy saucepan or deep fat fryer. Fry the sambutas a few at a time for about 1 1/2 minutes, turning over frequently. The 2 sides should have puffed apart by about 3/4 inch. If they don=t puff, you can just split them apart with a knife when serving. Drain on paper towels. When ready to serve, use a small pointed knife to cut an opening in the pocket.

Simmer until the chard is wilted and the tomatoes break down, about 10 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, blend 3/4 cup of the beans with 1/4 cup of the broth in a processor until almost smooth. Add the pureed bean mixture, remaining broth, and Parmesan cheese rind to the vegetable mixture. Simmer until the potato pieces are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Stir in the whole beans and parsley. Simmer until the beans are heated through and the soup is thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Discard Parmesan rind and rosemary sprig (the leaves will have fallen off of the stem.)<br> Ladle the soup into bowls and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 11434,&quot;Italian Poached Oranges 8 seedless oranges 1 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup water 1/4 cup orange liqueur, such as Cointreau or Grand Marnier Instructions: Strip the zest from the oranges with a vegetable peeler, making sure not to peel away any of the white pith. Cut the zest into 1/8-inch shreds with a sharp knife. Place shredded zest in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over low heat. Drain zest, discard cooking water and place zest in a bowl; cover zest with cold water and set aside. Combine the sugar and the water in a medium saucepan, bring it to a boil and cook the syrup until it thickens slightly about 3 minutes. While the syrup is cooking, peel the oranges to expose the flesh. Lower the heat on the syrup and cook the oranges 1 or 2 (they should be submerged in the syrup--if not, switch to a smaller saucepan) at a time for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the oranges from the syrup with a slotted spoon and place in a serving bowl. Add the shredded zest to the syrup and cook the zest for two minutes, or until the zest is translucent. Remove the zest from the syrup and scatter over the oranges. Chill the oranges and sprinkle with orange liqueur just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 11435,&quot;Fried Chicken and Buttermilk Waffles 1 (3 1/2 pound) fryer chicken, cut into 8 pieces, giblets reserved and chopped 1 cup all purpose flour 1 tablespoon Essence, recipe follows Vegetable oil, for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 1/2 cups buttermilk Unsalted butter, topping Maple Syrup 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Chicken: Heat enough vegetable oil to come about 1-inch up the sides of a large, deep cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F. Rinse the chicken under cold running water and do not dry; leave wet. In a large sealable bag, combine the flour with the Essence. Add the chicken pieces 1 at a time, seal, and shake to coat evenly. Remove and place on a wire rack over a baking sheet and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Carefully add the chicken to the hot oil and fry, turning once, until golden brown and the meat is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes (the thighs and legs will take longest to cook). Remove and drain on paper towels. Remove the pan from the heat and with a slotted spoon, scoop out any browned bits remaining in the pan and drain on paper towels. Waffles: Preheat a waffle iron and lightly grease. Into a large bowl, sift the dry ingredients together. In a clean bowl, beat the eggs. Add the butter and buttermilk and beat to combine. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and mix well. Pour the batter into the hot waffle iron and cook until golden brown and lightly crisp. Remove and if desired, top with a slice of butter, and serve with the chicken and maple syrup. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container.

For the pork: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place your favorite dry rub into a bowl. Coat all sides of each piece of the pork and place in a medium deep roasting pan. (This can also be done in a slow cooker and cooked on high.) Add onions and beer to the pan. Cover with foil and bake until pork pulls apart easily with a fork, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from the oven. Drain out liquid and let cool, then shred meat with your fingers. (You don&#39;t have to shred completely; you can leave some larger chunks for texture.) In a large saute pan add pork and the desired amount of BBQ sauce. Cook, stirring frequently, until hot. Toast hamburger buns. Add pork to the bun bottoms. Add iceberg and desired amount of pickled onions to the bun tops. Serve and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Merlot, Malbec]&quot; 11439,&quot;Cow Patty Cookies 2 tablespoons salted butter 1/4 cup packed brown sugar<br> Pinch kosher salt 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds 1/2 cup roasted peanuts 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 2 cups granulated sugar 2 1/2 sticks (1 1/4 cups) salted butter, softened 2 large eggs<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips<br> 1 cup dried cranberries, dried cherries or raisins<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and line a plate with wax paper. For the nuts: Melt the butter in a skillet and add the brown sugar and a pinch salt. Cook until the butter starts to bubble, about 3 minutes, then add the almonds and peanuts and stir to coat the nuts completely. Sprinkle over the cinnamon and stir until incorporated. Transfer to the lined plate and set aside to cool. For the dough: Cream together the granulated sugar and butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, scraping the sides once, until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing after each addition. Mix in the vanilla. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt, then add in batches to the mixer, mixing until just combined after each addition. Gently stir in the chocolate chips, dried cranberries and reserved cooled nuts. Using a 1/3-cup scoop, add portions of the dough to the lined baking sheets, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Bake until the middles of the cookies are set, about 20 minutes. They will be fragile at this stage, so let them cool for 10 minutes, then move them to a cooling rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11440,&quot;Clam Chowder 2 dozen littleneck clams 2 dozen cherrystone clams 1 quart water 1 head garlic, sliced in 1/2 horizontally 3 bay leaves 2 sprigs thyme, leaves picked 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 ounces pancetta, cut into cubes 1 celery stalk, diced 1 onion, diced 2 heaping tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup milk Freshly ground black pepper 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped Parmesan Oyster Crackers, recipe follows 2 cloves garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 stick unsalted butter 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups oyster crackers 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: Wash and scrub the clams to get rid of the dirt. Set the littlenecks aside in the refrigerator, and combine the cherrystone clams with the water, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme leaves in a large pot. Cover, and steam over medium-high heat until the clams have all popped open, about 15 minutes. Check every 5 minutes to pull out the clams that have opened (some take longer than others), and give the pot a stir. Pull the opened clams out of their shells and chop them roughly. Cover them and set aside. Pour the broth into a big bowl through a strainer that you&#39;ve lined with cheesecloth, just in case there is leftover sand; set the broth aside. Rinse out the pot and melt the butter over medium heat. Add the pancetta, celery, and onion. Saute this together for 5 minutes, until the vegetables soften. Sprinkle the flour into the pot; stir and coat everything well. Gradually pour in the strained clam broth, whisking constantly to break up any lumps of flour. When all the broth is incorporated, fold in the potatoes, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly for about 15 minutes. The soup will start to thicken from the potato starch. Reduce the heat to low and fold in the cream, milk, and chopped clams. Toss in the littleneck clams and cover the pot to let them steam open, about 5 minutes. Season the soup with many turns of freshly ground black pepper and stir everything together to heat through, but do not let it boil. Serve this in nice big bowls with some chopped parsley and Parmesan Oyster Crackers. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Chop garlic cloves then sprinkle with some salt and smash to make a paste. Set a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add butter, oil and garlic and swirl pan. Add oyster crackers and chopped flat-leaf parsley and toss to coat. Spread out on a sheet tray, season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with shredded Parmigiano. Pop into the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crispy. Yield: 2 cups &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 11441,&quot;Soppressata and Provolone Grilled Cheese 16 slices spicy or plain soppressata (about 2 ounces), diced 12 slices provolone (about 6 ounces), diced Eight 1/4-inch-thick slices semolina bread 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 tablespoon fig jam or mostarda, for serving Instructions: Mix together the soppressata and cheese in a medium bowl. Lay out 4 slices of the bread on a work surface and divide the meat and cheese mixture evenly among the bread, about 1/3 cup each. Close the sandwiches with the remaining bread. Thinly and evenly spread the butter on both sides of the bread using about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter for each sandwich. Place 2 sandwiches into a medium skillet over medium heat. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook until the bread is evenly golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip, cover again and cook until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is visibly melted, about 2 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches. Serve with fig jam on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 11442,&quot;African Stew 2 chickens, cut into pieces 3/4 cup peanut oil 2 large onions, chopped 3 tomatoes 4 1/2 cups water 1/4 cup tomato paste 1 teaspoon Vegesal 1 cup peanut butter 3 sweet potatoes, cut into chunks 6 carrots, thickly sliced in rounds 12 okra pods 3 bell peppers (red/green/yellow/orange), de-seeded and diced 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or 1 cl pepper Instructions: In a large heavy pot, brown chicken in hot peanut oil.

Cut two 12-inch sheets of plastic wrap. Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, making 6 roughly equal pieces; they should look like large chicken tenders. Place one sheet of plastic on a clean cutting board. Put a chicken piece in the center of the plastic and top with the other sheet of plastic. Pound the chicken with the flat side of a meat mallet, starting in the center and working your way to the edges, until the chicken is 1/4 inch thick and 6 to 8 inches long. Transfer to the wire rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Liberally sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.<br> Mix the flour with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of pepper in a shallow bowl or plate. Dredge the cutlets in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot, about 1 minute. Sear 3 cutlets until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the cutlets to a plate. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan and sear the remaining 3 cutlets until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. It&#39;s ok if the chicken is not completely cooked through; it will finish cooking in the sauce.<br> Add the mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the same pan and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until the mushrooms are slightly softened and just beginning to release some liquid, 3 to 4 minutes. (The mushrooms will soak up the oil quickly and dry up the pan; that&#39;s ok, more liquid will release as they cook longer.) Add the shallots and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Remove the pan from the heat. Pour in the wine and 1/2 cup water. Return the pan to high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the liquid reduces by a third and starts to thicken, 6 to 7 minutes. Whisk in the butter and continue whisking until it is melted and the sauce has thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Add the cutlets and any accumulated juices to the pan and cook, flipping halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 2 minutes.<br> Remove the chicken to a platter and stir the parsley into the sauce. Pour the sauce over the chicken and garnish with more parsley.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 11444,&quot;Round 2 Recipe - Southwest Beef and Black Bean Chili 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 medium yellow onion, diced 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1/2 pound cubed leftover pot roast from Pot Roast with Roasted Root Vegetables, recipe follows 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained 1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder 2 cups water Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup shredded Monterey jack cheese 1 1/2 pounds beef bottom round roast 2 teaspoons salt, plus more for seasoning 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces 2 stalks celery 1 medium yellow onion 1 (15-ounce) can beef broth 1 cup water 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 carrots, cut into 3-inch pieces 2 russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes 1/2 pound turnips, cut into wedges 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 teaspoon each fresh rosemary and fresh thyme leaves 1 red onion, sliced Instructions: Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and add the oil, diced onion and garlic and saute until the onions are golden, about 5 minutes.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. For the pancakes: Whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl.<br> Whisk together the milk, sour cream and egg yolks in another medium bowl. Whisk the yolk mixture into the flour mixture until just combined, then stir in the carrots (the batter will be lumpy). Allow the batter to rest while you whip the egg whites.<br> Beat the egg whites in a separate medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.<br> Heat an ebelskiver pan over medium heat for 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low and brush 4 of the wells generously with melted butter so there is some butter pooling at the bottom of each (the butter should barely sizzle when it hits the pan). Fill each buttered well with about 1 tablespoon batter. Repeat with the butter and batter in the remaining 4 wells. (You are working in batches to prevent the butter from burning.) Allow the batter to cook slightly around the edges, about 30 seconds.<br> Carefully spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling into the center of each ebelskiver and gently press down into the batter. Spoon about 1 teaspoon additional batter on top of the filling in each so the wells are very full and the filling is covered. Cook until the bottom crusts are golden brown, an additional 2 1/2 minutes.<br> Push a wooden skewer through the raw batter and into the bottom crust of each ebelskiver to turn it slowly. Allow the raw batter to flow back into the well and create a new bottom crust. (If an ebelskiver does not slide up easily or hold its shape, slide it back to its original position and give it more time to cook and set.) Cook until the new undersides are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Check all sides of the ebelskivers: If there are pale spots on some, turn them pale-side down so that they brown against the bottom of the pan for a few seconds. When they are done, the ebelskivers should be deep golden brown all over and a skewer inserted deep into the pancakes, avoiding the filling, should come out clean. If you find that some are cooking much more quickly than others, rotate the pan occasionally to even out the heat. Remove the ebelskivers from the pan.<br> Repeat the process with the remaining melted butter, batter and filling. By the second batch, the pan will be significantly hotter, so you may need to reduce the heat or remove the pan from the heat occasionally to ensure even cooking. Dust the ebelskivers with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 11448,&quot;Beer-Battered Apple and Onion Rings Vegetable oil, for frying 1 egg white 1 cup dark beer 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus extra for sprinkling 1 large onion, ends trimmed and skin removed 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored Salted Cinnamon Sugar, recipe follows 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Pour enough oil in a medium saucepan to reach a depth of 2 inches. Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F. In a medium mixing bowl whisk the egg white until frothy. Stir in the beer. Add the flour and salt. Mix until the batter is smooth. Set aside. Cut the onion into 1/2-inch slices and separate into rings. Slice each apple into 5 rings and pat dry with paper towels. Dip the apples slices into the batter and allow any excess batter to drip off. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes each side until golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried apple rings to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the onion rings. Transfer the apple and onion rings to serving platters. Sprinkle the onion rings with salt. Sprinkle the apple rings with the Salted Cinnamon Sugar. Serve immediately. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.

Brush two 9-inch-round cake pans with vegetable oil; dust with flour and tap out the excess. Make the cake: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Combine the granulated sugar, vegetable oil, buttermilk, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl; whisk until smooth. Whisk in the food coloring, then add the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Spread 3/4 cup batter in each of the prepared pans (you&#39;ll have a very thin layer of batter); set the remaining batter aside. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean and the top springs back when pressed, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool about 5 minutes in the pans, then invert the cakes onto the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, cool the pans under cold water, then wipe clean. Brush with oil and dust with flour again. Repeat to make 2 more cake layers, using 3/4 cup batter for each, then repeat again. You will have 6 layers. Make the frosting: Beat the cream cheese, butter and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until fluffy. Beat in the vanilla, then beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar in three additions until smooth. Put 1 cake layer on a serving plate and spread evenly with a scant 1 cup frosting. Repeat with the remaining 5 cake layers, then frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting in a thin layer (just enough so the nonpareils will stick). Refrigerate until the frosting is just set but still soft, about 10 minutes. Put the cake (on the plate) on a rimmed baking sheet. Cover the top and sides completely with the nonpareils, reusing the ones that fall onto the baking sheet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11451,&quot;Pastiera 4 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 4 large eggs 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup whole milk 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pan 2 cups sugar 3 pounds whole-milk ricotta cheese (about 6 cups) 1 cup heavy cream 14 large eggs 5 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 cups cooked white rice Grated zest of 1 orange Instructions: Make the crust: Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, eggs, melted butter and milk in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, 4 to 5 minutes. Lightly butter a 10-by-15-inch baking dish. Press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan in an even layer; set aside.

Very lightly oil one of the cut sides of the squash and season with salt. Place the potato and squash on a sheet pan and bake until both are tender and able to be pierced with a knife, 30 to 45 minutes. Scoop the squash out of the outer skin, transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Set aside. Peel the skin off of the potato. Grate the potato with a box grater and transfer to a bowl to cool slightly. When the potato is just warm and there is no visible steam, add the butternut squash puree, flour, cheese, egg yolk and some salt. Using your hands, mix to form a dough. Once the dough forms, move to a smooth surface and gently knead the dough for 3 to 5 minutes, adding flour as needed. Cover and allow the dough to rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Cut the dough into strips and roll to form the cut dough into even shaped logs. Cut the gnocchi to size, each about 1-inch long.

Remove the top layer of plastic and pound with the tenderizing side of the mallet, turning the meat over to tenderize on both sides. Repeat with the remaining steaks. Generously season with salt and pepper and set aside while you set up the breading station. In a shallow dish, stir together the cracker meal, flour, cayenne and some salt. In another shallow dish, whisk together the milk and eggs. Dredge a steak in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Now dip it into the egg wash, letting any extra drip off. Return the meat to the flour mixture and coat it well. Put onto a baking sheet while you coat the rest. When ready to fry, heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. When hot, fry the steaks in batches until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. For the gravy: Put the skillet with the grease back over the heat. When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over the grease. Using a whisk, mix the flour with the grease, creating a golden-brown paste. Add more flour if it looks overly greasy; add a little more grease if it becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking until the roux reaches a golden brown color, about 5 minutes. Pour in 3 cups of the milk, whisking constantly. Add the seasoned salt and black pepper to taste and cook, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Be prepared to add more of the remaining milk if it becomes overly thick. Be sure to taste to make sure the gravy is sufficiently seasoned.

Toss carrots with 1 tablespoon of the salt and let stand to get rid of excess water, about 45 minutes. Gently press carrots against the sieve to remove any remaining moisture. Rinse and drain. Place the carrots in a clean kitchen towel, then twist the towel to squeeze out any excess water. Repeat the process using the daikon. Whisk together the sugar and vinegar until sugar is completely dissolved. Divide this pickling mixture among 3 quart-size plastic bags, and set 1 bag aside to use in Step 4. Add the carrots and daikon separately to the other 2 bags, seal and toss to coat evenly. Lay bags flat on a plate and refrigerate at least 24 hours, turning the bags over every hour if possible. After about 20 hours, repeat step 1 using the cucumbers. After draining, place the cucumbers in the third plastic bag of pickling mix, seal, and toss to coat. Lay the bag flat on a plate and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, turning bag every hour if possible. The cucumber needs only 4 to 6 hours to absorb the flavor of the vinegar marinade. Drain the carrots, daikon and cucumbers well at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before serving.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 11501,&quot;Cornflake-Crusted French Toast With Bananas 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 bananas, thinly sliced 2/3 cup maple syrup 3 large eggs 1 cup whole milk 3 tablespoons sugar 3 cups cornflakes, crushed 4 slices Texas toast, halved on the diagonal Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Set the pan over high heat and bring the oil to a light smoke. Add the carrots, sprinkle on 1 teaspoon of the salt, and turn the carrots to coat them in the oil. Cook, turning over the carrots occasionally, until they&#39;re browned in spots, 6 to 8 minutes. Pop the pan in the oven and roast, shaking the pan occasionally, until the carrots are evenly tender, 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the size of your carrots. Let the carrots cool slightly. Halve the burrata and arrange the halves on a platter. Arrange the carrots on the platter so they&#39;re pointing this way and that. Add the pesto here and there in little dollops.<br> Pluck enough 2-to 3-inch delicate sprigs from the reserved carrot tops to make about 1 1/2 lightly packed cups and toss them in a bowl with the basil. Whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil with the lemon juice and a good pinch of salt in a small bowl until the mixture looks creamy. Use a little of the lemon dressing to lightly dress the carrot top-basil mixture, sprinkle on a little more salt, and toss well. Arrange the mixture on top of the carrots and burrata. Drizzle everything with the remaining lemon dressing and serve. Combine the carrot tops and basil in a small food processor, pulse several times, then add the walnuts, Parmesan, garlic, and salt. Pulse several more times, add the oil, then process full-on, stopping and scraping down the sides of the processor or stirring gently if need be, until the mixture is well combined but still a bit chunky.

Rub into the pork butt and allow to sit at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. For the wet mop: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the apple juice, vinegar, mustard and pepper flakes together with 1 cup water. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Prepare a grill for indirect low heat (if desired, add wood chips to the burner element on the direct side): For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Lightly oil the grill grates. Cook the pork butt over indirect heat, keeping the temperature consistently at about 225 degrees F, 5 hours and 30 minutes. Continue to cook, basting the pork butt with the wet mop sauce every 20 minutes, until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 195 degrees F, 2 hours and 30 minutes to 4 hours and 30 minutes more. Transfer the pork butt to an aluminum pan, tent loosely with foil and allow the meat to rest 20 minutes. Use 2 forks to shred the meat and transfer to a bowl.

Meanwhile, whisk together the rest of the milk, eggs, yolks, the remaining sugar, and cornstarch. Temper the egg mixture with 1/3 of the hot milk, whisk well, and pour back into the saucepan. Over medium heat, continue to cook and whisk until the custard is thick and starts to bubble. Continue whisking and cooking for 10 more seconds. Strain the pastry cream through a sieve, pushing through with a spatula, into a clean mixing bowl. Immediately cover the entire custard surface with plastic wrap and cool before using. When the pastry cream is cool, remove the plastic wrap, insert the beater attachment into the stand mixer, and beat the pastry cream on medium speed until smooth. Remove the cream to a mixing bowl. Whisk the heavy cream to stiff peaks and fold into the pastry cream in 2 additions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11523,&quot;Chocolate Candle Place Settings 32 ounces white chocolate, tempered Powdered food colors 8 ounces cocoa butter, melted 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Instructions: Make the candle base and the candle: Use a ladle to fill each mold (2 candle halves and a base) with chocolate. Tap the mold on the counter to encourage the air bubbles to depart. When the mold is full, set it aside and let it harden. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with as many molds as you would like.<br> For the homemade transfer sheets: Place the powdered food colors in small bowls. I used orange, green and blue. Add a few tablespoons of cocoa butter to the food color and stir until well combined. Pour a little of the colored cocoa butter onto a clean dishtowel. This will serve as a blotter or ink pad for the color. Place the sheet of acetate on the work surface. Press the rubber stamp into the blotter and then press onto the acetate sheet. Continue using this same process to create as many colors and stamps as you like. Be sure to clean the rubber stamp between colors. If you need to reheat the cocoa butter, use a hair dryer or heat gun.<br> When the stamped transfer sheet has set, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of white chocolate over the acetate sheet. Break the cooled colored chocolate into interesting free-form shapes.<br> Fill a cornet with bittersweet chocolate and use it to write names onto the transfer sheet shapes. This will be the place card for the candle.<br> To stick the candle halves together: Invert a flat baking sheet over a pan of hot water. Press one half of the candle against the warm surface. When the chocolate begins to melt, press the other half of the candle into place. Press the candle bottom onto the warm pan. Center the melted candle bottom on the base. Allow it to set until hardened.<br> Make the flame of the candle: Use an offset spatula to spread some white chocolate candle flames onto a sheet to acetate. The chocolate should be tapered at one end to resemble the flame. Allow it to set, then remove from the acetate. Press the bottom of the flame onto the warm baking sheet. Then adhere it to the top of the candle.<br> Place some powdered red food color in a small bowl. Add a few tablespoons of cocoa butter to the food color and stir until well combined. Use a paintbrush to paint the flame with the color.<br> Place a small amount of white chocolate in a cornet. Pipe white chocolate at the top of the candle until it runs down the side. This resembles the melted wax of a real candle. Place a small amount of bittersweet chocolate in a coronet and use it to make small dots for the candles&#39; eyes. Use more tempered white chocolate to glue the nameplate to the base of the candle. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 11524,&quot;Babybel &amp; Fig Jam on Brioche Toast 2 Mini Babybel?

Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander. While the pasta is still in the colander, use kitchen sheers to cut the linguine into smaller pieces. The pasta should measure about 3 cups. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the muffin tin. In a blender combine the eggs, milk, cream, and mascarpone cheese. Blend until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the cut pasta, prosciutto, mozzarella cheese, Asiago cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir until the ingredients are combined. Using a 1/3 cup measure, fill each of the muffin tins until both the pasta and liquid are at the top. Bake until firm and cooked through, about 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 3 minutes before removing from the tin.

Butter the bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans; line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust the bottoms and sides of the pans with cocoa powder, tapping out the excess. Put the eggs (in their shells) in a medium bowl and cover with hot tap water; let stand 5 minutes (warming the eggs will help them whip better). Sift the cocoa powder, cake flour and salt into a medium bowl, then whisk in the almond flour; set aside. Remove the eggs from the water and crack into a large bowl. Add the granulated sugar and beat with a mixer on low speed to combine. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until pale, fluffy and thick, about 10 minutes. The mixture should fall off the beaters in a ribbon when lifted. Sprinkle one-third of the flour mixture over the egg mixture and gently fold with a whisk until combined. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture in two batches, adding the vanilla with the final addition. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes pull away from the sides of the pans and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Immediately run a small offset spatula around the edges to loosen. Let the cakes cool 5 minutes in the pans, then remove to a rack, parchment-side down, and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the whipped cream: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan (the cornstarch will help stabilize the whipped cream). Slowly add 3/4 cup heavy cream, whisking, until a paste forms. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring, until thick and bubbling, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl, place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate until completely cooled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Bring the cherries, cherry syrup, kirsch and granulated sugar to a simmer in a small saucepan, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the almond extract and transfer to a bowl. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Finish the whipped cream: Beat the remaining 2 1/4 cups cold heavy cream and vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. With the mixer running, add the cooked cream mixture and beat until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the cherries and reserve the syrup. Discard the parchment from the cakes. Trim a thin layer off the top of each cake with a long serrated knife. Put one cake cut-side up on a cake stand or serving plate and brush with half of the reserved syrup. Spread about 1 cup whipped cream over the top in a thin layer, then top with all but 1/4 cup cherries. Spread 1 cup whipped cream over the cherries in a thin layer. Top with the remaining cake and brush with the remaining syrup. Spread 1 1/2 cups whipped cream over the top and sides of the cake in a thin layer (some crumbs are OK). Refrigerate 30 minutes. Spread the remaining whipped cream over the top and sides of the cake. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Sprinkle the shaved chocolate around the top of the cake and press into the sides; top with the reserved cherries. Refrigerate overnight; the cake will soak up the syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 11529,&quot;Bean Chili Veggie Burgers 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon chili powder 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled 1 (15.5-ounce) can pink beans, rinsed and drained 1 (4-ounce) jar diced pimentos, rinsed and drained 1/4 cup finely diced celery 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley 3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 3 tablespoons vegetable oil Mixed greens and sliced tomato, for serving 4 soft hamburger buns<br> Choice of Choice of Hidden Valley Ranch?

Mix the onion powder, garlic powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper in a small bowl. Rub the mixture on all sides of the pork. Combine the pineapple, hoisin, honey, soy sauce, vinegar, and 1 cup water in a Dutch oven. Add the pork and bake for 6 hours (alternatively, cook the pork in a slow cooker for 8 hours on low). Shred the pork with 2 forks, removing any large pieces of fat. Return to the Dutch oven and stir to incorporate with the sauce. For the cauliflower crust: Increase the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Break the cauliflower into florets and pulse in a food processor until fine. Steam in a steamer basket and drain well. (I like to put it on a towel to get all the moisture out.) Let cool. Combine the cauliflower with the mozzarella, Parmesan, oregano, garlic powder, eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Transfer to the center of the prepared baking sheet and spread into a circle, resembling a pizza crust. Bake until brown and crispy around the edges, about 20 minutes. Top the pizza with 1 1/2 cups pulled pork, the fresh pineapple and mozzarella and bake until warmed through and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes more. Garnish with pickled red onions and cilantro. Put the onions in a nonreactive heatproof bowl.

Stir the chives into the chilled risotto. Form into 8 patties, using about 1/4 cup risotto for each. Press a hole in the center of each patty and stuff with a cube of fontina; pat risotto around each hole to cover. Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl. Lightly dredge each risotto cake in the crumbs, turning to coat evenly. Place on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the cakes, 2 or 3 at a time, until evenly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain; season with salt and pepper. Combine the greens and fennel in a bowl; drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper and toss. Divide the risotto cakes and salad among 4 plates. Bring the broth and 4 cups water to a simmer in a saucepan; keep warm. Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion; cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and thyme; cook, stirring, until the rice is glossy, about 1 minute. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed. Add 1 teaspoon Kosher salt. Ladle in the hot broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, allowing all of the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue until the rice is just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the thyme. Stir in the parmigiano, the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt and pepper to taste. Gently stir in the fontina and chicken. Reserve about 2 cups risotto for Risotto Cakes.

Sprinkle with pectin followed by the anise, nutmeg, lemon juice and vinegar. Once liquid starts to gather in bottom of pan, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower heat slightly and boil gently for five minutes occasionally mashing mixture. Mash in sugar, add the water and return to a boil for 1 minute. You just made jam. Cool, jar, refrigerate and enjoy within 2 weeks. Or, move to the preserving phase. Preserving the jam: Thoroughly wash all hardware in hot soapy water. Then pile everything (excluding the jar lids) into the pot. Cover with hot water by at least 1-inch and bring to a boil and maintain for 10 full minutes to sterilize. Turn off the heat, wait 5 minutes then add the lids (waiting will insure that the sealing compound does not melt). Leave all hardware in the pot until you&#39;re ready to can.<br> Remove the ladle, tongs, funnel and other tools from the pot, (careful please, it&#39;s hot in there) to a clean towel or paper towels. Using the jar tongs, remove and drain the jars, placing them on the towel/paper towel surface. (Avoid rock or metal surfaces which could result in thermal shock and breakage.)<br> Place the funnel in the first jar (pick it up by the ring, avoiding the sterile interior.) Use the ladle to fill each jar just to the bottom of the funnel, about 1/3-inch from the bottom of the jar threads. This \\headspace\\ is necessary for the jars to seal during processing.<br> Wipe the jar rims with a moist paper towel, checking for any cracks or irregularities as you go. Use the magnetized device of your choice to position lids on each jar. Screw the rings on finger tight. (Remember, the rings don&#39;t seal the jars they only hold the lids in place. Heat will drive out the headspace air, which when cooled will create a vacuum, thus sealing the jars)<br> Return the jars to the pot being certain that they don&#39;t touch the bottom of the pot or each other. (If you don&#39;t have a jar rack, try a round cake rack, or metal mesh basket. Even a folded kitchen towel on the pot bottom will do in a pinch.) Add additional water if necessary to cover the jars by at least an inch, and bring to a hard boil over high heat according to the table below. (Be sure not to start your timer until a true boil is reached. The headroom air may bubble out of the jars before a boil is reached. Don&#39;t be fooled.)<br> Processing times: Within 1,000 feet of sea level: 5 minutes 1,000 - 3,000 feet above sea level: 10 minutes 3,001- 6,000 feet above sea level: 15 minutes 6,000 - 8,000 feet above sea level: 20 minutes Above 8,000 feet: wait until you&#39;re back down at base camp.

Remove the vein and rinse them well. Butterfly the shrimp by cutting almost all the way through the shrimp with a knife. Pat dry and set aside. Heat 2 inches of peanut oil in a wok or deep skillet to 375 degrees F. While the oil is heating, whisk the eggs and club soda together in a large bowl. Whisk in 2 cups cornstarch making sure to get out any lumps. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. Season generously with salt and pepper - remember it is called Salt and Pepper Shrimp! Put the remaining cornstarch on a platter and season it well with salt and pepper. Working in batches, dredge the shrimp in the cornstarch and shake off any excess. Dip the shrimp in the batter and let the excess batter drip off. Slide the shrimp into the hot oil and cook about 3 minutes until golden brown, turning them once during cooking. Remove and drain on paper towels. Scoop out any floating bits of batter from the oil, they will burn. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper while they&#39;re still hot and put them onto a serving platter.

Mix the sugar, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire, cinnamon, chili powder and allspice in a small bowl. Cut two 20-inch sheets of heavy-duty foil, overlap them perpendicularly and place the ham in the middle skin-side up. Pour the sugar mixture over the ham, making sure the ham is fully covered. Cover the ham with the foil and seal it to keep the mixture from leaking. Put the ham in a 6-quart air fryer and cook at 325 degrees F for 30 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note); when you open the foil, the ham will be starting to brown and there will be plenty of juices in the foil. Baste the ham thoroughly with the juices. Continue to cook, uncovered, until the slices begin to come apart and the top is a deep brown, another 20 minutes. Baste the ham again with the juices. Continue to cook until the ham is dark and shiny on top but still pink and juicy in the center and an instant-read thermometer registers 140 degrees F, an additional 10 minutes. Transfer the ham to a serving platter and pour the juices into a small saucepan. Let the ham rest for 10 minutes. Simmer the juices over medium-low heat until they thicken into a syrup, about 10 minutes.

Cut the butter into 8 to 10 pieces and add to the dry ingredients. Rub the butter in finely; be careful that the mixture remains cool and powdery. Beat the eggs lightly and stir them into the dough with a fork. Continue stirring until the dough masses together. Remove the dough to a floured surface and knead lightly, until the dough is smooth. Form the dough into a rectangle about 1-inch thick and wrap in plastic. Chill the dough until it is firm, about 1 hour. Butter a 10 x 15-inch jelly roll pan. Roll the dough to a rectangle about 12 x 17 inches. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin, then unroll it into the pan. Press the dough well into the bottom and sides of the pan and fold the excess dough into the pan. Make a high fluted edge around the edge of the pan. Chill the dough-lined pan while preparing the filling. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the corn syrup and sugar in a saucepan and mix well. Place on medium heat and stir occasionally, until the syrup comes to a boil. At the boil, add the butter and cream and return to a boil. Simmer the mixture for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and rum. Place the chopped pecans in a heatproof mixing bowl. Pour the cooked syrup over the pecans and stir well to mix. Pour the filling on the dough in the pan and spread it evenly with a metal spatula. Bake the pastry on the lowest rack of the oven for about 30 minutes. Turn the pan occasionally to make sure that the dough and the filling bake evenly. Remove the pan from the oven and cool it on a rack to room temperature. Wrap the pan in plastic wrap and chill overnight. To unmold the pastry, run a small, sharp knife between the crust and the sides of the pan. Place the pan on low heat for a few seconds to loosen the pastry. Place a cookie sheet on the top and invert. Remove the pan in which the pastry baked and replace it with a cutting board. Invert, remove the cookie sheet and trim away the edges of the pastry.

Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Using a bowl as a guide, draw two 7-inch circles on one piece of parchment with a pencil and one 7-inch circle on the other piece; flip the parchment so the markings are underneath. Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Toast the sesame seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, tossing a few times so they do not burn, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer immediately to a food processor. Add the almonds and 1 cup of the granulated sugar and process until the mixture is finely ground and resembles flour. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and fold in the apple juice until combined. Whisk the cream of tartar, salt, egg whites and remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar in the heatproof bowl of a stand mixer. Place the bowl on top of the pot of boiling water. Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking the mixture constantly so the eggs don&#39;t start to cook, until the mixture is white and the sugar has dissolved completely, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the mixture on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form and the mixture is silky, 4 to 5 minutes. Spoon about 1 cup of the egg white mixture into the almond flour mixture and gently fold with a large rubber spatula until combined. Fold the remaining egg white mixture into the bowl until just combined, taking care not to overmix. Clean the mixer bowl and set aside to use again. Divide the batter among the 3 circles on the parchment and spread evenly with an offset spatula to fill the circles. Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes, then switch the position of the pans and continue to bake until the meringue layers are firm, dry and golden, 30 to 45 minutes longer. The layers are done when they easily peel off the parchment. Let cool slightly on the baking sheets, then peel off the parchment and transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. For the apple compote: Meanwhile, put the apple juice in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil until the juice has reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low, add the apples, honey, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are softened and the liquid is thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Fold in the walnuts, then transfer the mixture to a medium bowl to cool completely, about 30 minutes. For the tahini buttercream: Add the butter and tahini to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until well combined and light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until combined. Add the vanilla and salt and beat just to combine. Cover the bowl and set aside until ready to use. To assemble the cake: Put 2 meringue layers on a baking sheet; spread a third of the buttercream onto each, to the edge. Divide the apple compote between the 2 meringue layers on top of the buttercream and spread, leaving a little space around the edge. Place one of the compote-topped meringues on a platter and stack with the other compote-topped meringue. Top with the last meringue, then cover the top with the remaining buttercream, making large swoops and swirls. Top with chopped walnuts and sesame seeds, if desired. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour and up to overnight before serving.

Add the olive oil and duck bones and necks and deeply brown on both sides. Add the onions, carrots, celery, lemongrass, garlic, bay leaves, thyme and a large pinch of salt and stir. Add the wine and stock and simmer for at least 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld. Meanwhile, place a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the sugar and vinegar and bring to a simmer, whisking to dissolve the sugar. Add the orange juice and continue to simmer the gastrique until syrupy, 8 to 10 minutes. You should have around 1/2 cup. When the stock mixture is ready, strain it and add 1/2 cup to the gastrique, whisking to combine. Simmer until reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes, then keep the sauce warm. For the duck: While the sauce is reducing, score the skin on the duck breasts in a crosshatch pattern using a very sharp knife and being careful not to cut into the meat. Season the breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and place skin-side down in a cold large saut pan coated with a drizzle of olive oil. Place the pan over medium-low heat and slowly render most of the duck fat, 8 to 10 minutes. When the skin is deep golden brown and crisp, flip the breasts over and briefly brown on the other side. Place the star anise, ginger and thyme into the rendered fat and then baste the breasts until they have finished cooking, 3 to 5 minutes for medium. Transfer to a cutting board and keep warm. Reserve the duck fat in the pan for the potatoes. For the parsley salad: Combine the parsley stems and orange supremes in a medium bowl. Toss with the orange juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and set aside. For the potatoes: Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and salt it generously. Meanwhile, tourne the potatoes. Trim each end so it\\u2019s flat. The length of each potato should be roughly 2 inches. Using a paring knife or bird\\u2019s beak knife, make 7 slices the length of the potato until you end up with a football shape. Put each potato in cold water after you tourne it to prevent oxidation. Add the potatoes to the boiling water and boil until crisp-tender, 6 to 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes and pat dry. Place a saut pan over medium heat, add the reserved duck fat and heat until shimmering. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl, then add 1 tablespoon of the fat back to the pan. Add the potatoes and cook, turning often, until light golden brown on all sides. Turn the heat down to low. Season with salt and pepper, then add the thyme and continue to cook, turning the potatoes occasionally, until tender. Add the breasts to the pan, then pour off any excess fat. Remove the pan from the heat, add the Grand Marnier and flambe. When the flame goes out, return the pan to the heat, add the reserved sauce and heat through. Stir in the parsley and butter, season with pepper, then remove from the heat. Thinly slice the breasts, flesh-side up, against the grain. Place the potatoes on a platter, followed by the sliced duck, fat-side up. Drizzle with the sauce and top with the parsley salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 11612,&quot;Robin&#39;s Egg Nest 1 vanilla cupcake, recipe follows Basic Glaze Icing, tinted deep yellow, recipe follows 1 blue twisted licorice stick Green coconut grass 3 small blue malted milk eggs 2 2/3 cups sugar 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 2/3 cup milk 2/3 cup water 2 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/3 cups cake flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3 (1 pound boxes) confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup water 5 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Food coloring, as desired (see suggested colors below) Instructions: Dip cupcake into the icing; let excess to drip back into bowl. Place cupcake on a rack over paper towels to catch any drips. Cut a length of the licorice, about 1 1/2 inches long, press the ends together to form a ring. Press ring into the icing to make a nest. Fill nest with coconut grass and place eggs in the nest. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup cupcake tins with paper liners. (To avoid cupcakes sticking if they overflow slightly, lightly spray the tops of the pans.) Put tins on a baking sheet. Set aside. Process sugar and butter in a food processor until very creamy, scraping sides as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, pulsing after each addition. Add the milk, water, and vanilla and process to blend. Whisk both flours, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients, in 3 batches to the wet, pulsing, and then scraping batter off the sides of the processor as needed after each addition. Process until the batter is very smooth, about 2 minutes. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared cups, filling them 3/4 of the way full. Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Put the sugar in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly add the water, the corn syrup and vanilla extract. When the sugar is sufficiently moistened (it won&#39;t fly out of the mixer), raise the speed to high, and beat for 2 minutes until completely smooth and glossy. Divide and color, as desired. Store at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the icing, to prevent forming a skin. For cupcakes: Dip the surface of the cupcake into the icing, allowing excess to drip into bowl. Clean any excess from the sides. Alternately, use a knife or a spreader to apply. Whisk as needed to keep icing glossy and smooth while using. For Light Blue Icing: Combine 2 to 3 drops of blue food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. For Deep Yellow Icing: Combine 4 to 5 drops of yellow food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. For Purple Icing: Combine 4 drops of red and 5 drops of blue food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 11613,&quot;Fried Ravioli Olive oil, for frying 1 cup buttermilk 2 cups Italian-style bread crumbs 1 box store-bought cheese ravioli (about 24 ravioli) 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1 jar store bought marinara sauce, heated, for dipping Instructions: Pour enough olive oil into a large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches. Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees F. While the oil is heating, put the buttermilk and the bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Working in batches, dip ravioli in buttermilk to coat completely. Allow the excess buttermilk to drip back into the bowl. Dredge ravioli in the bread crumbs. Place the ravioli on a baking sheet, and continue with the remaining ravioli. When the oil is hot, fry the ravioli in batches, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried ravioli to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle the fried ravioli with Parmesan and serve with a bowl of warmed marinara sauce for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]&quot; 11614,&quot;Texas Tomato Toast with Roasted Garlic Spread and Homemade Ricotta 2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 10 cloves garlic Kosher salt 8 cups high-quality whole milk 2 cups cultured buttermilk (preferably not low-fat) Kosher salt Heavy cream, optional 6 to 8 thick slices white bread (or even better, buy a loaf of fresh, unsliced bread and slice it at home as thick as you like) Kosher or sea salt 6 to 8 small tomatoes Small fresh basil leaves, or large leaves cut in chiffonade Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the roasted garlic spread: Combine the oil and garlic in a small saucepot, turn the heat on to low and let sit until the garlic floats, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Remove the garlic from the oil and place in a small bowl. Add 1/4 cup of the cooked olive oil and a pinch of salt to the bowl and mash with a fork until coarsely mixed. Reserve the remaining oil for other uses (including griddling the Texas toast). For the ricotta: Combine the milk and buttermilk in a heavy saucepot, turn the heat on to medium-low. Stirring very occasionally, check the temperature until the mixture reaches 180 degrees F. (If you do not have a thermometer, watch for curds to begin forming, turn the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.) Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture sit for 1 hour to let the curds fully develop. Do not stir the mixture during this time. Line a colander or other large strainer with cheesecloth and set over a large bowl. Gently ladle or pour the mixture over the cheesecloth. Allow the whey to drain from the curds and collect in the bowl below. (Whey can be saved for other uses, mostly anything buttermilk can be used for). After about 1 hour of draining, transfer the curds to a small bowl and season with salt. (If a creamier consistency is preferred, a few tablespoons of cream can be added to the ricotta to loosen it) For the Texas toast: Heat a heavy skillet or pan over medium-low heat for a few minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved roasted garlic olive oil to the skillet, then add a slice of bread. When the one side has reached a deep golden brown color, remove the slice from the skillet. Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the skillet and proceed to griddle the other side of bread. When it has reached a deep golden brown, remove from the skillet and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining slices. Slice the tomatoes into thick slices and sprinkle with salt. Smear the Texas toast with 2 tablespoons roasted garlic spread. Assemble tomato slices on top of a slice of toast (1 tomato per slice). Place several small dollops of ricotta on top of the tomatoes. Top with basil.

Meanwhile, make the syrup: Dissolve the 1/4 cup granulated sugar in 1/2 cup lemon juice in a saucepan over low heat. Remove the cake from the oven, poke the surface all over with a skewer and pour the syrup on top. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Carefully invert the cake onto a parchment-lined rack to cool completely. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let sit overnight. When ready to serve, whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice until smooth.

Add the mushrooms and garlic and continue sauteing until the moisture releases and completely evaporates, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Add the cheese and herbs and set aside. For the masa: Combine the masa harina with the stock and salt. Work in the lard until you get a spreadable consistency. If necessary, add a bit more stock.<br> To assemble the tamales: Drain and pat dry the corn husks. Spread the masa about 1/8-inch thick on each corn husk with your fingers, leaving about 1/2-inch border along the sides and a 2-inch border along the top and bottom of the husks. The key to good tamales is to spread the masa thinly. Then, use about 2 tablespoons/30 ml of the mushroom stuffing per tamale. Top with 2 to 3 poblano strips. Fold the sides until they just overlap, fold the narrow end under and place the tamales folded-side down in the steamer.<br> To cook, steam the tamales, covered, in a bamboo steamer over simmering water until the masa is no longer sticky, about 1 hour.

Place the flour and confectioners&#39; sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Turn to low speed and add the 2 sticks of butter a few pats at a time. Once all the butter has been added, beat until the flour, sugar and butter begin to form a dough and it holds its shape when pressed together with your fingers. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and gently knead and bring together to form a ball. Pat the dough into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Place into the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. Spray eight 4-inch fluted tart pans with removable bottoms with nonstick cooking spray. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and flatten into a disc. Press the dough into each tart shell, using your fingers to press the dough up the sides of the tart shell. Trim any excess dough that overhangs from the top. Dock the dough with a fork. Place the tart shells into the fridge to chill for 5 minutes. Line the inside of the tart shells with parchment paper and fill with baking beans. Transfer the shells into the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and baking beans, then put back into the oven for another 5 minutes. Allow to cool before filling. To make the pastry cream, add the egg yolks, 4.4 ounces (125 grams) of the granulated sugar and the cornstarch to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until the yolks are pale yellow and peaks begin to form, a few minutes. Scrape down the edges of the bowl with a spatula and beat again to ensure the ingredients are fully incorporated together. Add the coconut milk, salt and vanilla beans with the pod into a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring to a gentle boil. Remove from the heat and gradually, very little at a time, add the heated coconut milk into the whipped egg yolk mixture with the stand mixer on low speed. It&#39;s important to add it very gradually to temper the eggs so they will not scramble. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan that the coconut milk was heated in and turn the heat to medium-low. Whisking constantly, cook until the pastry cream has thickened and reaches the consistency of pudding, about 5 minutes. Transfer the thickened pastry cream back into the stand mixer bowl and whisk on medium speed. Add the remaining 3 1/2 tablespoons (50 grams) butter one pat at a time. Beat for 1 to 2 minutes to cool it down. Spread the pastry cream onto a quarter sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap, pressing down onto the pastry cream itself to avoid a skin from forming on the top. Place into the fridge to chill for 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a pastry bag and set aside. To make the glaze, set up an ice bath in a large bowl and set aside. Add the gelatin sheets to a bowl with some water to bloom for 5 to 10 minutes. Add 3.8 ounces (110 grams) of water and the remaining 3.8 ounces (110 grams) of granulated sugar to a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high and stir to melt the sugar. Add the lemon juice, then the bloomed gelatin and stir over medium heat until melted. Transfer into a bowl and set over the ice bath. Arrange the mango slices in a line and fan out. Roll to create a rose. Fill each tart shell with pastry cream and top with a mango rose. Brush the glaze over the top of each mango tart.

Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and reserve. For the Greek seasoning blend and pork: Oil a grill pan and place over medium heat. Put the oregano, garlic powder, thyme, dill, beef bouillon powder, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix well. Drizzle some oil over the pork and sprinkle the seasoning blend on all sides of the meat. Add the pork steaks to the grill pan and grill until cooked to medium, 7 to 10 minutes.

Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in the salt. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until most of the flour has been incorporated and the dough forms a ball. Continue to mix at the lowest speed until the dough has become a sticky ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl; about 4 to 5 minutes. Dust the counter lightly with flour. Knead the dough by hand for a minute and form into a ball. Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let it sit in a warm spot for 2 hours to rise. To form the baguettes: Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Press each piece of dough into a rectangle and fold the long sides up into the middle. Roll each into a log, taking care to close the seam. Taper the ends by gently rolling it back and forth. Lay the baguettes on a sheet pan that is dusted with cornmeal and cover with a towel. Let the baguettes rise for another 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. With sharp knife, make 4 or 5 diagonal slashes across the top of each loaf. Brush the tops of the loaves with milk. Bake for 40 minutes, until the bread is golden brown.

In a 4-quart saucepan, reduce gently the 2 quarts of stock until lightly syrupy (about to 1 pint). Combine the reduced stock with the reduction. Let it sit for a few minutes to infuse the flavor, then strain. Check the salmon for bones. To form a tournedos roll the piece of salmon in to a small medallion, wrap it in bacon and tie it. You should make 2 small tournedos per portion. 1 Season the tournedos with salt and pepper. Saute them in a hot saute pan with very little olive oil starting with a high heat and lowering the heat during the cooking. Cook for about 1.5 minute per side. Remove from the pan and hold warm in a plate. Remove the butcher twine. In one saute pan warm up some olive oil with the garlic cloves. When the garlic starts frying, remove it and add the mushrooms. Cook them at high heat for a few seconds. Season and reserve them in a bowl. In the same saute pan gently sweat the minced shallots with olive oil until tender but not colored (use a little water if necessary) then add the sprouts, season and saute for a few seconds until cooked. Reserve in a bowl. Finish the sauce by reducing it in a saute pan for adjusting the consistency, adjusting the flavor with salt and pepper, and add butter and fresh herbs. Place the sprouts in the center of the plate. Add the mushrooms on top of the sprouts and the salmon on top of the mushrooms.

Roasted Garlic: Peel the paper exterior off of garlic heads. Set the garlic heads on top of aluminum foil square. Brush the garlic head with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and top with any desired fresh herbs. Fold the sides up crimping tightly.

Bring to a light simmer over low heat, stirring frequently. When the grits start to thicken to an oatmeal consistency, add 1 cup of water and continue to cook in the same manner. Repeat with 1 more cup water. Once the grits start to thicken once more, add the cream and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the grits thicken again. Add the butter and allow to melt throughout. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow grits to cool, loosely covered, 2 hours, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Reheat the grits over low to medium heat, stirring well, adding additional milk or cream if needed for the right consistency. Add the goat cheese and mix well. Add more salt and pepper if needed. Oil a hot skillet or griddle, then add a 6-ounce ladle or scoop of goat cheese grits. Cook through until a brown crust has developed on the bottom of the grit cake, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip the grit cake with a spatula or pancake turner, making sure to get between the crust and the skillet, rather than between the crust and the grits. Continue to heat through until a bottom crust has developed, roughly 5 more minutes. For the duck: Prepare a smoker or grill for indirect cooking at 225 degrees F. Stir together salt and pepper in a bowl. Lightly rub duck breasts with salt and pepper, and place in your smoker or over indirect heat on your grill. Cook, undisturbed, until lightly browned from the smoke and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 150 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Remove from smoker and allow to rest at least 15 minutes. Preheat a grill (if you used a smoker) for cooking at 225 degrees F. To crisp the skin, lightly run a sharp knife in a cross-hatch pattern on the skin, then baste lightly with oil or melted butter. Place skin-side-down on the grill until skin is crispy but duck meat is not overcooked, about 5 minutes. For the asparagus: Meanwhile, preheat a grill for cooking over medium heat. Heat a large amount of water in a large stockpot over high heat. Add a generous handful of salt. Bring to a roiling boil. Add asparagus to the boiling water. (If you have a steamer basket, this is an excellent time to use it, as it makes fishing the asparagus out a breeze.) Cook the asparagus until just turning soft while still maintaining a bright green color. Remove the asparagus from the hot water and allow to cool completely, preferably in ice water. Rub the asparagus lightly with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook until desired level of char appears on the stalks, about 5 minutes. For the smoked blueberry sauce: Meanwhile, add blueberries to a skillet or aluminum pan. Place blueberries in the smoker alongside the duck, taking care to leave room for air to circulate, and smoke until the berries take on a dusky midnight blue appearance, about 15 minutes. (Longer cooking will lead to stronger smoky flavor in the berries.) Remove the berries from the smoker, then heat them on the stove over high heat with the dark brown sugar. Add the dark rum, being careful of flames. Allow the alcohol to burn off and continue to heat the pan, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved, the berries have released some of their juices, and the sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve the duck breast over the grits with the sauce and asparagus. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 11689,&quot;Summer Garden Salad 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon white vinegar<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 head green leaf lettuce, chopped 3 heirloom tomatoes, cut into wedges<br> 4 mini cucumbers, cut into wedges<br> 1 orange bell pepper, cut into chunks<br> 1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks<br> 1 yellow bell pepper, cut into chunks<br> Instructions: For the dressing: Combine the buttermilk, mayonnaise, sour cream, dill, garlic powder, vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl.

Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes. Remove from the pans and cool the cakes completely on wire racks, about 30 minutes. For the torrone filling: Mix together the butter and powdered sugar with the paddle attachment in an electric mixer. Once thoroughly combined, add the torrone paste. Continue to mix until evenly distributed. For the chocolate hazelnut fudge: In a food processor, place the powdered sugar, cocoa and salt. Blend to remove any lumps. Add in the butter and blend until smooth. Add the corn syrup. Process just until combined, and then scrape down the sides. Pulse. Add the chocolate hazelnut spread, and then pulse until completely combined, smooth and creamy. To assemble: Core each cupcake, and then fill with the torrone filling. Using a round tip and pastry bag, ice each cupcake with chocolate hazelnut fudge, creating a swirl on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 11691,&quot;Roasted Pear Sauce 4 red skinned Bartlett pears 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, divided 6 garlic cloves 2 shallots 1 quart chicken broth, low sodium 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Instructions: Split the pears in half and cut out the core.

Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 11693,&quot;Pecan-Crusted Catfish with Spicy Cream Sauce Four 4-ounce catfish fillets Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2/3 cup cornmeal 1/2 cup pecans 1/4 cup flour 1/2 cup milk 1 egg 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 chunks yellow onion (about 1/4 small onion total) 1 clove garlic, smashed 1/2 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup white wine 1 tablespoon steak sauce Juice of 1/2 lemon (about 3 tablespoons) 3 tablespoons sour cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Rice or mashed potatoes, for serving Instructions: For the pecan-crusted catfish: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and set aside. Pulse the cornmeal with the pecans and some salt and pepper in a food processor until uniform and the size of breadcrumbs. Create a breading station with the flour on a plate, the milk and egg beaten together and the pecan-cornmeal mixture on another plate. Be sure to sprinkle salt and pepper on each part of the breading station. Dip the fish in the flour, then the egg, then the cornmeal mixture. Heat the oil in a large oven-safe saute pan over medium heat. Brown the coated catfish until golden on one side, about 3 minutes. Then turn the fillets over and place in the oven to finish cooking, about 10 minutes longer (a few minutes more if the fillets are thick). For the spicy cream sauce: Place the onions and garlic with the stock, wine and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Boil and reduce for 5 minutes, gently pressing on the onions and garlic to release the flavors. Remove the onion and garlic and discard. Turn down the heat to low and whisk in the steak sauce and lemon juice, then the sour cream. Allow to cook and reduce 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly. (Place back on the heat for 10 seconds if needed to keep the temperature high enough.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 11694,&quot;Levi&#39;s Homecoming Lamb 2 green onions, white tips removed, chopped 1/2 hot red cl, preferably Scotch Bonnet, seeded and finely chopped (wear gloves) 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint leaves 6 allspice berries 3 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked Juice of 2 limes 1 tablespoon olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (4.5-ounce) lamb rumps (top round lamb) 3 tablespoons sunflower or groundnut oil (peanut) 1/3 cup water 4 ounces Jamaican or Irish stout 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish Rice and Peas, recipe follows 1 fresh coconut 3 1/3 cups warm water, plus more as needed 1 (14-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed 1/2 onion, coarsely chopped 1 hot red cl, preferably Scotch Bonnet, whole and undamaged 1 green onion, bruised with a rolling pin 1 clove garlic, peeled 7 allspice berries 2 fresh thyme sprigs 2 tablespoons butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 16 ounces Basmati rice Instructions: For the paste: Pound the green onions, cl, mint leaves, allspice berries, thyme leaves, lime juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a mortar and pestle, grinding them as hard as you can. For the lamb: Wash the lamb rumps and pat them dry with paper towels. Mix the spice paste with the lamb in a bowl, using your hands to get it well coated. Cover the bowl, and let the meat rest for at least 1 hour, or overnight, in the refrigerator. Heat the oil in a medium-sized heavy-bottomed saucepan. Once hot, add the lamb. Immediately cover the pan with a lid, and turn the heat down to medium. Cook for 5 minutes. Swirl the water in the bowl in which the lamb was marinated and add the liquid to the pan. Cover once again and cook for another 5 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the stout and brown sugar. Now, remove the lid, add the stout mixture, and bring everything to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat to low, and cook for around 8 minutes, or until the lamb is cooked through. The cooking juices should evaporate, leaving you with a lovely, dark and glossy stew with a bitter, hot, and sweet flavor. Garnish the dish with fresh mint sprigs and serve with Rice and Peas. To make Rice and Peas: First break into the coconut. Choose one of the 3 eyes that you are most likely to be able to puncture. Cook&#39;s Note: Youll see them at one end. Only one will work. Try to penetrate the eye with a strong, sharp-tipped knife. If the hole doesnt give, try the others. Pour the coconut water out through its eye and set it aside in a small bowl. Smash the coconut open, and, using a small, sharp knife, lever the coconut flesh away from the shell. Cook&#39;s Note: Doing this outside against some concrete is a good idea. Grate the coconut into a bowl. Pour 2 3/4 cups water over the shreds, and stir. Strain the coconut flesh from the water in fistfuls, and squeeze out all its juices over the bowl. Place the squeezed clumps of grated coconut into a sieve, transfer the coconut water to a saucepan and tip the squeezed coconut back into the bowl. Cover the coconut shreds with the remaining clean water and, once again, lift the coconut flesh up from the water in fistfuls and squeeze out all its juices. Transfer the prepared coconut water to the saucepan, and discard the squeezed-out flesh. If desired, incorporate the fresh coconut water to the saucepan at this stage. Then, add the black beans, onion, cl, green onion, garlic, allspice berries, thyme, butter, and adjust their seasonings with salt, and black pepper. Bring everything to a boil, cover, and then turn down the heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse the rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice, and then add the rice to the saucepan with the reserved prepared coconut water or base in the saucepan. You may need to add some additional water to bring the liquid about 1-inch above the level of the rice. Season the cooking liquid with salt, and black pepper, bring it to a boil, and then cover the rice immediately. Turn the heat down to its lowest level, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Don&#39;t stir it and don&#39;t peek inside! Once the rice is tender, fish out the cl, green onion, and thyme sprigs, fluff the rice with a fork, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Petite Sirah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 11695,&quot;Ceviche, a Cold Seafood Soup 2 1/2 lbs. white fish 1 1/2 lbs. bay scallops 2 Tbs. good quality extra virgin olive oil 1 jalapeno pepper 1 sweet white onion (Maui or Vidalia) 1 garlic clove 2 Tbs. handpicked whole small cilantro leaves juice of 5 limes (zest and reserve as garnish) juice of 5 limes (zest and reserve as garnish)<br> juice of 2 lemons 3 red grapefruits 3 avocados salt pink peppercorns, coarsely ground white corn tortilla chips Instructions: Cut fish into half-inch cubes.

For the cake: Heat a skillet full of water to a bare simmer. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, whip eggs on high speed for 5 minutes. To the eggs add sugar, salt and vanilla and combine. Set the bowl into the hot water bath to heat the mixture to between 110 and 120 degrees F. Stabilize the mixture by whipping on medium speed for 15 more minutes. Meanwhile sift together the bread flour, the cocoa powder, and the pastry flour. Prepare the baking pans by greasing 2 (6-inch) diameter round pans and dusting with flour. Gradually fold the sifted dry ingredients into the egg mixture by hand. Slowly pour in the oil while folding. Fill the pans approximately 2/3 full with the batter and place immediately in the oven. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. (The surface of the cake should spring back when touched.) Cool 10 minutes in the pans, then remove to wire racks to let cool completely. For the syrup: Combine the sugar, water, cherry brandy, and cream of tartar in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat stirring only until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is hot. Cover and simmer gently for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, uncover and let cool. For the cherry filling: Place cherries in a small saucepot and add brandy, stirring to coat cherries. Heat over medium low heat until most of liquid evaporates, then remove from heat and let cool. For the pastry cream: Reserve 2 tablespoons of the milk then combine the rest of the milk with half the sugar and bring to a gentle boil. In a small bowl whisk the 2 tablespoons of reserved milk into the cornstarch to create a slurry. Add the other half of the sugar and then the eggs to the slurry and whisk to completely combine. Temper the egg mixture with the boiling milk. (This is done by spooning some of the milk into the egg mixture to equalize temperatures without cooking the eggs.) Return all liquids to the pot and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Cook for 1 minute. Remove the milk mixture from the heat and whisk in butter and vanilla extract. Pour into a large pan, put plastic wrap directly on the surface, and allow to cool. Slice each of the cake rounds (horizontally) into 3 (1/2-inch) thick layers using a long thin knife or taut wire. Place the layers onto baking sheets (which have a rim) and pour cherry syrup over the layers, allowing them to soak. For the cream topping: Whip the heavy cream and sugar with an electric mixer to a medium peak. Assemble the cakes by spreading a layer of the pastry cream on the bottom layer, then placing brandied cherries on top. Place a second layer on top of cherries and repeat. Top with final layer of cake. (Each cake will have 3 layers.) Frost top layer of cake with whipped cream topping and garnish with cherries and chocolate shavings. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Brachetto]&quot; 11701,&quot;Pasta With Escarole Kosher salt 12 ounces gemelli, fusilli or spaghetti 1 head escarole, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon pine nuts 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs Freshly ground pepper 1/4 pound pancetta, cut into thin strips 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 red or green jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced (remove seeds for less heat) 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until just al dente, about 10 minutes. Add the escarole and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 more minutes. Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in a large skillet over medium-high heat, about 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, the breadcrumbs, and salt and pepper to taste; cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a plate. Wipe out the skillet, add the pancetta and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and blot dry. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, then add the garlic and jalapeno and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Drain the pasta and escarole, reserving 1 cup cooking water, and add to the skillet. Add half of the pancetta and toss, drizzling in enough pasta water to moisten. Season with salt and pepper.

Form into a 5-inch disk, wrap in plastic and chill one hour, or up to 3 days. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and on a lightly floured surface, roll it to a 12-inch circle. Brush off any excess flour. Place the round on a sheet tray lined with wax or parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Peel, core and slice each apple in half. Slice each half in 3 sections and toss the apples in lemon juice. Set aside. Melt the butter, sugar and 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice together in an ovenproof skillet measuring 10 inches across the top. (Bakelite handles are ovenproof.) Cook, stirring, until the mixture turns a light caramel color. Be careful not to overcook; it will continue to darken from the residual heat in the pan. Remove from heat. Arrange the apple slices, rounded side down, in a circle around the skillet and in the center. Scatter the cranberries between the slices. You&#39;ll have enough slices to stack them 2 deep. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and center it over the skillet. Using scissors, trim the circle so that it overhangs 1/2-inch all around. Tuck the edge down between the apples and the skillet. Lightly brush the dough with cold water and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake about 40 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Remove from oven and let sit on a cooling rack for 5 minutes.

Add the lobster tails to the boiling water and cook for 8 minutes, then remove to the ice water and let sit until chilled. Slice in half lengthwise, cutting through the shells, and devein. Use 2 parallel skewers to thread 4 or 5 scallops, then repeat with the remaining scallops so you have 4 sets of double skewers. Repeat the same process with the shrimp. Thread all 4 lobster tail halves on two more skewers. Refrigerate until ready to grill. Stir together the butter, paprika, chili powder, habanero and garlic in a medium pot, then season with salt and pepper. Place over low heat and heat until just melted. Combine the capers, cilantro, mint, parsley, tarragon, thyme, chives and lemon zest in a medium bowl and mix. Add half to the melted butter and reserve the rest to garnish the platter.

In the bowl of a food processor, pulse flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 3/4 cup of pine nuts, and salt until finely ground. Add the butter. Pulse dough just until it comes together. Place the dough into an 11-inch diameter tart pan with a removable bottom and press down to cover the bottom and sides of the pan. Refrigerate until the dough is firm, about 30 minutes. Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the tart shell in the lower third of the oven until just set, about 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and pie weights. Bake until the tart shell is lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Cool completely. Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar with the water in a small saucepan over low heat. You don&#39;t want to boil the water, you just want to heat it so that the sugar can dissolve thoroughly. Stir until the sugar dissolves and remove from heat. In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the ricotta cheese and cream cheese until smooth. Add the eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time, and process until smooth. With the machine running, add the sugar syrup in a thin steady stream and process until smooth. Pour the custard into the tart shell and bake until the filling is almost set, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Squeeze the pods with your fingers to press the beans into your mouth and discard the pods. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 11750,&quot;Stove Top Roasted Pears with Dulce de Leche 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon molasses 4 large fairly firm pears (preferably Bosc or Anjou) 1 lemon, juiced 2 cups apple cider, divided Dulce de Leche, recipe follows Salt Grated dark chocolate, for garnish 1 pint whole milk 16 ounces granulated sugar Instructions: In a cast iron skillet large enough to hold the pear halves, add the butter and molasses and begin to \\melt\\ it over low heat. Meanwhile, put the pears on a flat surface, peel and halve them lengthwise. Use a small spoon to scoop out the center part of each half that contains the seeds and tough, fibrous flesh. Sprinkle the pears with lemon juice. When the butter and molasses are melted, add the pears and cook for 2 minutes and then flip. Add about 1 cup of cider to the pan and allow the pears to simmer until they start to become tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add more cider as needed to prevent them from burning. Cooking times will vary somewhat depending on the size of the pears and their ripeness. Smaller or riper pears will cook faster. Add the sugar and the milk to a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to dissolve the sugar and then simmer, stirring often, until the mixture has reduced by at least half, about 1 hour. The mixture should be thick and slightly caramel in color. Spoon some of the Dulce de Leche on each plate and top with the pears. Sprinkle with salt and garnish with grated chocolate. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the milk and the sugar. Stir thoroughly to blend. Put the pan over medium heat and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently, stirring from time to time. The milk and sugar will become \\thin\\ and then eventually \\simmer&#39; back together and turn a light brown color. Continue to cook, stirring from time to time, until the sauce is golden brown. This whole process takes about 25 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a bowl or jar to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 11751,&quot;Catelli&#39;s 10 Layer Lasagna with Domenica&#39;s Sauce 4 to 5 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for the pan<br> One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 2 cups sheep-milk ricotta, such as Bellwether Farm 1/2 cup mild goat cheese, such as Laura Chenel 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus additional for lasagna 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, plus additional for lasagna<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint<br> 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> Salt and pepper, to taste<br> 6 egg yolks, preferably organic 5 to 6 cups \\00\\ flour, preferably organic 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups milk, preferably organic 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme<br> Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: For Domenica&#39;s sauce: Lightly saute the garlic and chili flakes in the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the tomatoes and salt and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. For the three-cheese filling: Mix together ricotta, goat cheese, Parmesan, basil, mint, nutmeg and some salt and pepper in a bowl. For the pasta: Place the yolks in the base of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and turn on low speed. Start slowly adding flour. As the dough starts to come together, scrape down the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough and knead until smooth and not sticky. Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Cut dough into four quarters. Roll the quarters through a pasta machine, starting with the widest opening, taking it through each opening once or twice and finishing with the smallest opening. (You should be able to see through the finished pasta sheets.) Cut sheets into pieces that will fit in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Boil a pot of water and cook pasta sheets for about 1 minute, then remove them and put them in ice water to stop the cooking. Remove the sheets and lay out on clean kitchen towels or napkins. For the thyme bechamel: Heat the butter and flour in a saucepan over medium heat and stir together for a minute. Add the milk, thyme and some salt and pepper and cook until mixture starts to thicken. Turn off heat and set aside. To assemble: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a large baking dish with olive oil. Lay a sheet of pasta in the bottom and spread with a thin layer of bechamel and cheese filling. Spread with a rubber spatula or large metal spoon. Add a layer of pasta, then spread a layer of tomato sauce on that. Repeat this assembly until the pasta is all layered. Finish the top layer with tomato sauce and bechamel and sprinkle with Parmesan and basil. Cover with foil and bake for 24 to 30 minutes. Remove foil and cook for an additional 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 11752,&quot;Kiwi Kooler 1 cup guava nectar 1 tablespoon frozen limeade concentrate 4 kiwi fruits, skinned and chopped 1 (6-ounce) container nonfat vanilla yogurt 1 cup ice Instructions: Pour nectar into blender.

Stuff the cavity of the fish with lemon slices, thyme, bay leaves, and garlic. In a large mixing bowl, mix the salt and egg whites with your hands; it will become the consistency of wet sand.<br> In a large baking dish or rimmed baking sheet that is large enough to fit the entire fish (it&#39;s okay if the fish only just fits), lay one-third of the salt mixture down, roughly in the shape of the fish. Place the fish on top of the salt mixture and pack the remaining salt mixture around the fish, leaving exposed the area from the eyes to the nose, and also the tail fin. The salt mixture should fully encase the fish, but may not fill the pan. In fact, unless you use a really narrow pan, you&#39;ll probably leave most of the pan exposed.<br> Bake for about 30 minutes, until the internal temperature of the fish is 130 to 135 degrees F. Depending on the exact size of your fish, your cooking time may vary. Don&#39;t break the salt crust while it&#39;s cooking or you&#39;ll let the juices escape. If you have one of those nice thermometers with the wires that you can leave in the oven while you cook to determine temperature, use that, and pack the salt around the probe to seal it in before cooking. If you don&#39;t have one of those fancy thermometers, check the temp by going through the exposed mouth with a probe thermometer. Once done, remove the fish from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.<br> While the fish is resting, whisk together the lemon juice and zest, oil, Dijon, salt, and pepper to make a lemon vinaigrette to serve over the fish.<br> To remove the fish from the salt shell, use a butter knife and a wooden mallet or spoon. Like a paleontologist, I try to guess where the dorsal fin would be. Hit the fish right there, in the middle of the back (remember it&#39;s laying on its side). I place the tip of the butter knife where the dorsal fin was and tap it with the mallet or spoon, putting it in and giving it a wiggle. I score all the way around the fish, like I&#39;m excavating it, so I can remove the salt dome in one piece. It doesn&#39;t mess anything up if you don&#39;t get it off in the one piece, but it just looks cooler if you do. Once you&#39;ve gone all the way around the outline of the fish, remove the top part of the salt dome.<br> The skin is a little chewy, but it still tastes good, so help yourself to a piece. Cook&#39;s reward. Then go under the skin with a fork, down to the spine, and slide across the bottom to filet the fish from the spine. You might get it all in one filet. But most times you have to go back and clean it up.<br> Then take the mallet and butter knife, and place the knife at the base of the spine where it meets the head. Tap the handle end of the butter knife with the mallet to crack the spine. Remove the entire spine and bones. With a fork, slide along the bottom of the fish, between the flesh and the salt crust, to remove the other fish filet. You probably won&#39;t get the skin off cleanly with this filet, and that&#39;s fine.<br> This will yield two 10-ounce (or so) filets. Place each filet on a plate and finish with a spoonful of the lemon vinaigrette and a sprinkle of salt and parsley on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 11754,&quot;Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Pie One 9-inch refrigerated prepared pie dough, or your favorite single crust recipe 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 large egg 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt 1 cup rolled oats, plus more for garnish 3/4 cup dark and/or golden raisins Vanilla ice cream or unsweetened whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. Roll the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface (or between two pieces of floured parchment paper). Ease the dought into a 9-inch glass pie plate and flute the edge as desired. Chill 30 minutes. Line the pie dough with foil and pie weights and bake until the edge just starts to turn golden, about 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue to bake until the bottom is lightly golden, about 10 minutes more. Cool completely on a rack, about 15 minutes. Combine the sugar, butter, egg, flour, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Process until smooth and combined. Add the oats and raisins and pulse a few times until roughly chopped. Scrape the filling into the par-baked pie shell and spread evenly. Bake until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool on a rack for at least 1 hour if serving warm, or let cool completely and serve at room temperature.

(You may leave the seeds in if you prefer a spicy harissa.) Tear the chiles into large pieces and place them in a medium bowl. Pour 2 cups boiling water over the chiles and let stand until softened, about 20 minutes. Put the coriander and cumin seeds in a small skillet and cook, swirling often, over medium heat, until the seeds are fragrant and lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the spices to a blender and add the oil, garlic, lemon juice and 2 teaspoons kosher salt, then puree until smooth. Using tongs, add the chiles to the blender along with 1/2 cup of their soaking liquid (discard the rest) and puree until very smooth, about 2 minutes on high. Season the harissa with pepper and set aside. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 475 degrees F. In a small bowl, stir together 6 tablespoons butter with 1/4 cup of the harissa until smooth and well-combined; set aside. Place the chicken breast-side-up on a wire rack fitted into a rimmed baking sheet. Slide your forefinger gently under the skin of the chicken and loosen it from the breasts and thighs. Using a spoon, stuff the harissa butter underneath the skin of the breasts and thighs and press it so it spreads out evenly. Rub the exterior of the chicken with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity of the bird with the onion and celery and tie the legs together with butcher&#39;s twine. Roast the chicken for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 400 degrees F and continue to roast until the skin is crispy and golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thigh (avoiding bone) reads 160 degrees F, about 45 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and immediately brush all over with the remaining harissa. Set the chicken aside to rest for at least 10 minutes, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 11756,&quot;Pasta with Fresh Vegetables and Mozzarella 1/2 pound vine ripened tomatoes, washed and cut into small dice 1/4 cup scallions, thinly sliced 4 ounces fresh mozzarella, packed in water, cut into small dice 1/2 pound fresh fettuccine 1 tablespoons each butter and olive oil 1 bunch watercress, washed and most of stems discarded 1 bunch arugula, washed and stems discarded 1/2 cup finely slivered yellow bell pepper Salt and dried red pepper flakes Very fine julienne of fresh red radish and seeded kirby cucumber Instructions: Bring water to a boil for the pasta.

Combine in a large bowl with onions and a liberal amount of salt and pepper, and mix well. Heat fat until hot in a 10-inch nonstick skillet, over medium high heat. Add potatoes, shaking the pan and turning them to cover evenly with fat. Once a few slices begin to brown, press potatoes with a spatula to flatten into a disk. Adjust heat to medium low, cover tightly, and cook until several slices are golden brown on the bottom, about 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully lift off cover so condensation does not fall on potatoes, and wipe dry. Mix cooked slices into other potatoes and than add shaved truffles, if desired. Replace cover, and cook until bottom of galette is golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Shake galette onto a plate, cover with a second plate of the same size, invert then slide galette back into pan. Do not worry if some slices need rearranging. Flatten potatoes again, and cover. Cook 10 to 12 minutes longer, removing lid after 5 minutes, or until potatoes are golden brown, turning heat up slightly if needed to color potatoes. Turn galette again, if necessary, and cook uncovered for a few minutes longer, or until golden brown. Galette may be loosely tented with aluminum foil and kept warm in the oven or on top of the stove. Slide galette onto a flat plate. Season with salt and pepper. Combine parsley with garlic, and sprinkle over potatoes. Cut into 8 wedges and serve. For the duck, score the skin. Season both sides of duck breasts with salt and pepper. Heat 2 heavy skillets until medium hot, over medium high heat. Put duck breasts in pans, skin side down, without any butter or fat. Cook for 8 minutes, checking to avoid burning. Remove fat as it accumulates. Flip breasts over, lower heat to medium and cook 4 minutes longer. Remove duck from heat and keep warm in one of the skillets. Meanwhile, heat the port wine in a saucepan to a boil. Add the diced plums and 2 tablespoons of demi-glace and simmer, partially covered, until the plums are cooked and tender (10 to15 minutes.) Puree with a hand mixer until smooth. Adjust seasoning and keep warm. Heat 2 tablespoons of sugar until lightly caramelized. Add the Armagnac in which prunes have marinated for no less than 15 days. Reduce by half. Add 3 tablespoons prune juice. Reduce until almost syrupy. Strain and season. Keep warm. Cut the breasts across the grain into 1/4-inch slices. Place the plum compote in the center of the warm plates, fan the duck slices on top and drizzle the reduction over it. Serve immediately with a potato galette. Use the prunes to make prunes in Armagnac ice cream, or prune tart, or eat them as is as a digestif. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Barolo]&quot; 11763,&quot;White Claw Black Cherry Cupcakes Nonstick cooking spray One 15.25-ounce box red velvet cake mix One 12-ounce can black cherry hard seltzer, such as White Claw Black Cherry Hard Seltzer 3 large eggs 3/4 cup cherry jam or preserves One 16-ounce can vanilla frosting 24 maraschino cherries, for decorating Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the milk and all but 1-tablespoon of the sugar in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stop stirring and cook until the milk begins to bubble around the edge of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat. Whisk together the egg yolk and the remaining 1-tablespoon sugar in a small bowl. Pour half of the hot milk over the yolk mixture, whisking constantly to combine. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly and reaches 185 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Immediately pour the mixture over the chocolate. Whisk until the chocolate is melted. Add the butter 1/2-tablespoon at a time, whisking until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the vanilla. Scrape the batter into a 6-inch round cake pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer for at least 6 hours, or overnight. To unmold the cake, carefully immerse the pan in hot water for a few seconds. Wipe the bottom and sides of the pan dry and invert the cake onto a serving platter. Decorate the top of the cake by running a hot dull knife across its surface in a wave pattern (dip the knife in hot water and wipe completely dry before using it). Lightly dust the top of the cake with sifted cocoa powder. Allow the cake to stand at room temperature for 45 minutes before serving. Store leftovers in the refrigerator. Note: It is important that the butter be at room temperature, or it will not blend completely into the chocolate mixture and there will be a small lumps of butter in the cake. You can make this 2 or even 3 days in advance and freeze it. When you need it, unmold it and let it stand at room temperature for 45 minutes so its not freezer cold. Or unmold it and then store in the freezer, whole or cut into portions, for up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 11766,&quot;Blackened Salmon 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon cayenne 10 sprigs fresh thyme, washed, leaves removed and chopped 1 tablespoon freshly chopped oregano leaves 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 (6 to 7-ounce) pieces salmon, pin bones removed, skin-on 3 to 4 tablespoons canola oil 2 lemons, zested and juiced Instructions: In a small bowl, add the paprika, cayenne, thyme and oregano and salt and mix to blend.

Pour over the corn, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Make the hottish sauce: Coat the bottom of a large saute pan with canola oil and set the pan over medium heat. Add the onion, bell peppers, garlic and jalapeno and sweat the vegetables until limp, 5 minutes. Add the chili powder and cayenne; toast the spices about 2 minutes. Add the tomato juice, red wine vinegar, mustard and 1 cup water. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the sauce reaches the consistency of ketchup, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a blender and puree until completely smooth. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to loosen the sauce, if needed. Season generously with kosher salt. (The sauce can be made up to 3 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Preheat a grill to medium high. Remove the steaks from the marinade and season well with kosher salt and black pepper. Grill approximately 4 minutes on each side for medium rare. Let rest while you finish the corn salad. Drain the corn. Add the olive oil and lime juice and let sit 5 minutes, then add the bell peppers, shallot, tarragon, parsley, Amber spice mix and 1 tablespoon of the hottish sauce. Season the steaks with a little flaky sea salt. Serve with the corn salad and a little hottish sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 11769,&quot;Tex-Mex Pork Fajitas with Corn and Mushrooms 1 tablespoon paprika 2 teaspoons light brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon chipotle cl powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds 1-inch-thick boneless center-cut pork chops 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates Juice of 1 lime 1 tablespoon olive oil 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 4 ears fresh corn, kernels removed 1 poblano pepper, seeded and chopped Kosher salt 3 scallions, sliced Juice of 1 lime For Serving: Warm tortillas, chopped cilantro, guacamole, sliced pickled jalapenos, lime wedges, shredded pepper jack cheese, salsa, chopped scallions and sour cream Instructions: Mix together the paprika, brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, chipotle cl powder, garlic powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.

If you&#39;re using sea scallops, cut each 1 in half horizontally. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, toss with flour, and shake off the excess. In a very large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over high heat until sizzling and add the scallops in 1 layer. Lower the heat to medium and allow the scallops to brown lightly on 1 side without moving them, then turn and brown lightly on the other side. This should take 3 to 4 minutes, total.

Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and gingersnap crumbs and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 3 to 5 minutes; set aside. Combine the heavy cream, maple syrup, thyme, allspice, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the cayenne in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Butter a 3-quart baking dish. Spread a single layer of sweet potatoes in the bottom of the baking dish and pour about one-third of the cream mixture on top. Repeat to make 2 more layers of potatoes and cream. Cover with foil and bake 40 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until the cream is bubbling and the potatoes are lightly browned and tender when pierced with a knife, 40 to 50 more minutes, sprinkling the breadcrumb mixture over the potatoes during the last 5 minutes of baking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 11775,&quot;Berries with Sweet Tequila Cream 2 cups (1 pint) heavy cream 1 cup sugar<br> 10 large egg yolks (save the whites for another use)<br> 2 tablespoons tequila<br> Zest of 1 lime<br> 4 cups mixed fresh berries, such as strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and raspberries<br> Instructions: Combine the cream with 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a strong simmer just so tiny bubbles start to appear around the edges of the pan; don&#39;t let it boil. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup sugar for about 1 minute. Whisk in the tequila. Now, with the mixer on medium low, very slowly drizzle in the warm cream using a metal measuring cup to scoop out small portions at a time. Drizzle it in so that the cream runs down the side of the bowl, reducing the impact of the hot cream hitting the eggs. Keep whisking! After all of the cream is added, turn off the mixer. Pour the mixture into the top of a double boiler (or a glass bowl fitted over a saucepan of simmering water). Cook in the double boiler over medium heat, stirring gently but constantly as the egg/cream mixture slowly thickens, from 8 to 15 minutes. Watch the mixture: if it starts to really thicken up, remove it immediately from the heat. You want this to be a thick, pourable cream rather than a thick, heavy pudding. Prepare a large bowl with ice. As soon as you remove the double boiler or glass bowl from the heat, set the bottom of it in the bowl of ice to stop the cooking process. Be careful not to let ice or water drip into the cream mixture. Stir in the lime zest and continue stirring to cool. If you need to use the cream right away, keep it in the ice bath. Or transfer it to a container, cover and refrigerate for several hours. When ready to serve, fill bowls with the berries and spoon the cream on generously. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 11776,&quot;Puntas de Filete Sonorense Clarified butter 1 medium onion, finely sliced 1 green bell pepper, cut in 1/4-inch strips 6 ounces button mushrooms, stems removed, finely sliced Freshly ground salt, to taste Freshly ground white pepper, to taste 1 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin tips, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch slices Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1 medium onion, finely diced 1 serrano chili, seeded and finely chopped 1/4 cup port 1 (7-ounce) can pimento, diced 2 medium tomatoes, blanched, peeled, seeded and cubed 1 avocado 1/2 lime, juiced 1-ounce salted butter Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon clarified butter in small frying pan over medium-low heat.

Remove from oven and cool for 2 hours before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 11789,&quot;Crispy Baked \\Fried\\ Chicken 8 chicken pieces (preferably 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs and 2 wings) 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cups cornflakes 2/3 cup buttermilk 2 tablespoons dijon mustard 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika 3/4 teaspoon ground sage Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place a rack in a roasting pan or on a baking sheet. Rinse the chicken in cold water; pat dry. In a wide bowl or on a plate, season the flour with salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Dredge each chicken piece through the flour so it&#39;s fully coated, tap against the bowl to shake off excess flour and set aside. Discard the flour. Here comes the part kids like best: Crush the cornflakes by placing them in a big resealable plastic bag, carefully pressing the bag to push out the air. Seal up the bag (with as little air inside as possible) and run over the flakes with a rolling pin. Open the bag and pour the crushed flakes into a wide bowl or onto a plate. In a large bowl (big enough to dredge the chicken pieces), mix the buttermilk, mustard, cayenne pepper, paprika and sage. Give each floured chicken piece a good buttermilk bath and then roll in the cornflake crumbs. Arrange the chicken pieces on the rack and place in the hot oven. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, lower the heat to 375 degrees and cook for another 25 to 30 minutes, until cooked through and crispy. The juices should run clear when the meat is pierced with a knife. Serve with Easy Greens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 11790,&quot;Coconut Water Smoothie Coconut water, regular or flavored 2 bananas 2 mangos 1 cup strawberries (fresh or frozen) 1/2 cup Greek yogurt 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: Fill ice trays with the coconut water and freeze until solid.
