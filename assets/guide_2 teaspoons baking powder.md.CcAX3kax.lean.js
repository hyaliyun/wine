Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until melted. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare three 9-inch round cake pans: spray the bottom and sides of each pan with cooking spray; line the pans with parchment paper; then spray again with cooking spray. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a stand mixer, cream the butter and the remaining 1 3/4 cups sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the cooled chocolate mixture and beat until smooth. Add the sifted flour mixture alternately with the milk, starting with a third of the flour, then adding half the milk, and ending with the flour. Stir only enough after each addition to blend the ingredients. Pour the batter evenly into the cake pans and bake for 35 minutes, or until done. Judge doneness by appearancelayers will begin to pull away from the sidesor by inserting a toothpick into the center of a layer. The toothpick should come out clean. Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto racks. Remove the paper and allow to cool completely before frosting. Spread the Divinity Icing between the layers and all over the top and sides of the cake. Pour the egg whites and salt into a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment. Beat the egg whites until smooth but not stiff; they should not form stiff peaks. In a large saucepan, mix the sugar, 3/4 cup water, corn syrup and vinegar. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then heat the mixture until it reaches the hard ball stage (265 degrees F on a candy thermometer), about 12 minutes. When done, the syrup will spin a long thread when poured off the edge of a spoon. Remove the syrup from the heat and stir in the mini marshmallows. The mixture will be foamy. With the mixer running at high speed, stream the syrup into the egg whites. Beat well, and then beat in the vanilla. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 73061,&quot;Lemon and Garlic Roast Chicken 1 (5 to 6-pound) roasting chicken Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 large bunch fresh thyme 4 lemons 3 heads garlic, cut in 1/2 crosswise 2 tablespoons butter, melted 1/2 pound sliced bacon 1 cup white wine 1/2 cup chicken stock Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat the peanut butter, granulated sugar, light brown sugar and salt with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla and egg. Stir in the chocolate chips. Put some granulated sugar in a small bowl. Shape tablespoons of the dough into balls and roll each ball in the sugar to coat. Evenly space the balls on the prepared baking sheets. Press each ball down with the tines of a fork to flatten it slightly and make a crisscross pattern. Bake until the bottoms are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 73074,&quot;Maple-Pecan Cookies 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1 teaspoon maple extract 2 1/4 cups self-rising cake flour 35 (approximately 1/2 cup) pecan halves 2 baking sheets, lined with parchment or wax paper or greased Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 F. Cream the butter and sugar. When you&#39;ve got a soft, supple mass, add the maple extract and work in the sifted flour. Roll into walnut-sized balls, and press with the base of a glass that you&#39;ve lightly oiled (and if you&#39;ve got some in the house, you could use walnut oil) or brushed with melted butter. Press gently onto the lined baking sheets--leaving a 2-inch space round each as they&#39;ll spread--and stud each with a pecan half. Cook for 15 minutes. They start off golden so it&#39;s hard to tell if they&#39;re cooked just by sight, but lift one up to check it&#39;s no longer doughy on the bottom. Remove from the oven, leave for a minute or two on the trays, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Variation: You can always substitute walnut halves for the pecans, but if you leave them completely nut-free, these are wonderful as cheese biscuits. Yes, they&#39;re sweet, but in the same way as digestive biscuits are strangely good with both creamy and hard cheese, so these can pair with a pungent blue quite wonderfully. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 73075,&quot;Cran-Rosemary Mocktail 1/4 cup whole cranberries, thawed if frozen, plus more for garnish 1 small sprig rosemary, broken in half, plus more for garnish 2 teaspoons superfine sugar 1 1/2 ounces distilled nonalcoholic spirits (such as Seedlip)<br> 1/2 cup cold tonic water Instructions: Combine the cranberries, rosemary and sugar in a cocktail shaker. Muddle until the cranberries and rosemary are broken down and juicy. Add the nonalcoholic spirits to the shaker along with a handful of ice.

Trim the excess skin from the duck or chicken and place on a lined baking sheet. Dry the trimmed skin in the oven, checking often, until crispy, about 15 minutes. Add the skin to a food processor along with the breadcrumbs, oil and the 1/8 teaspoon thyme leaves and blend until uniform. Set aside. (This step can also be done while the cassoulet is stewing). Heat the clarified butter over high heat in a heavy-bottomed saute or frying pan and, working in batches, sear the poultry, pork or lamb and sausage until they are caramelized, adding more butter if the pan gets dry. Remove the meats to a large roasting pan or deep broiler-proof baking dish as they are completed. In the same pan you browned the meat in, saute the onions, carrots and celery until they are caramelized. Add the tomatoes, wine, and 5 cups water, deglazing the pan by scraping all the loose particles from the bottom of the pan. Drain the beans and add them to the pan, along with the marjoram, parsley, bay leaves and 1/4 cup thyme. Bring the liquid to a boil. Pour the beans and liquid over the meats in the roasting pan, cover the pan tightly with foil if no lid is available and bake until the meat is fork-tender and the beans have absorbed most of the liquid and are tender, about 3 hours. Remove the meat from the pan, drain the liquid from the beans and vegetables and put it into a saucepan. Add two cups of the cooked bean and vegetable mixture to the liquid and puree with an immersion blender or puree in a blender before adding to the liquid. This will thicken the liquid into a sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Pour the liquid back over the remaining beans and vegetables, stirring to combine. Preheat the broiler. Slice the lamb or pork and lay it on the beans with the sausages and poultry legs. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture on top of the cassoulet and broil until the top is lightly browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 73077,&quot;Maple Roasted Pears 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 cup maple syrup 2 tablespoons brown sugar 2 tablespoons brandy 8 ripe pears, either Anjou, Bartlett, or Comice 1/4 cup dried cranberries 2 cups fat-free vanilla frozen yogurt 1/4 cup granola Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a 13 by 9-inch baking dish, combine the butter, maple syrup, brown sugar, and brandy. Peel the pears, halve lengthwise, and remove the seeds with a melon baller or teaspoon. Add the pears to the baking dish and coat with the maple mixture. Arrange the pears cut-side down, and bake until tender, about 50 minutes, basting occasionally. Meanwhile, put the cranberries in a small bowl and cover with hot water; set aside until plump. Drain and coarsely chop the cranberries. Transfer the pears to plates. Pour the baking juices into a small bowl, and whisk in 1 or 2 teaspoons of water to blend into a sauce. Top each pear with a small scoop of frozen yogurt, and scatter granola and cranberries over the pears. Drizzle the syrup over the top.

Add the Neelys&#39; BBQ Sauce, garlic, onions and diced tomatoes to a food processor and blend until smooth. Sprinkle the brisket on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the oil and once hot, add the brisket and brown, 5 minutes per side. Transfer the brisket to a plate. Pour the beer into the Dutch oven, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Stir in the chicken broth and pureed tomato mixture. Add the brisket back into the pot and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven until the brisket is incredibly tender and the meat is beginning to fall apart, about 3 hours. Shred the meat in the pot with tongs and place the mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish. Add the peas in a layer on top of the brisket. Meanwhile, add the potatoes to a large pot of cold salted water. Bring up to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until tender. Drain in a colander, then mash in a large bowl. Stir in milk and butter, and season with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes evenly on top of the meat and pea layer. Use a spoon to create some texture on the layer of mashed potatoes. Bake until golden and brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

Add water to the pot until it covers the ingredients by about 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for about 20 to 30 minutes or until the lentils are soft. Remove the pot from the heat and season the water with salt. Taste the water to make sure it is seasoned. Let the lentils sit in the salty water for about 10 to 15 minutes. This will allow the lentils to absorb the seasoned water. Ladle off 1 cup of the lentil cooking water and reserve. Remove all the vegetables and aromatics from the lentils and discard. Strain the lentils from the water. To assemble the lentils: Place 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon lardoons. When the bacon has rendered off a lot of fat and has become brown and crispy, add the onions. Season the onions with salt and sweat them until they become very soft and aromatic. Add the celery, fennel and carrot. Season with salt and saute over medium heat until the vegetables start to become soft and aromatic, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the cooked lentils, 1/4 of the reserved lentil cooking water, the mustard and vinegar. Cook until most of the liquid has reduced. Taste for seasoning, add salt or more vinegar, if needed. Serve hot or at room temperature. MMMMM!!!!

Spray a 12- by 12-inch square of heavy-duty aluminum foil with cooking spray. Place the salmon, skin-side down, on the center of the foil. Sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper and sprinkle the Italian seasoning and coriander over the top. Put 1 tablespoon of butter on top of each fillet and place 2 half slices of lemon on each. Wrap the salmon tightly in the foil, place on the grill, and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the salmon from the grill and open the foil packet to allow the steam to escape. Let stand until cool enough to handle. Reserving any cooking liquid in the foil packet, transfer the salmon to a small bowl and using a fork, flake it into large pieces; discard the skin. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the linguini until al dente, according to the package instructions. Put the peas in a large mixing bowl, drain the pasta and pour it over the peas in the bowl. (The heat from the pasta will cook the peas.) Add the reserved cooking liquid from the salmon to the bowl along with the tomatoes, capers and lemon zest. In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice, olive oil and mustard together until thick and emulsified; pour the dressing over the pasta and toss well to coat. Add the flaked salmon and dill, and toss gently until combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Transfer the pasta to a serving platter, garnish with chopped parsley and lemon slices, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 73087,&quot;Decadent Chocolate Poke Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking pan One 16-ounce box chocolate cake mix<br> 1 cup dark chocolate chips<br> One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 cup milk One 3.4-ounce packet instant chocolate pudding<br> 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br> One 8-ounce container frozen whipped topping, thawed<br> Maraschino cherries, drained, for decorating (optional) Instructions: For the cake: Spray a 9-by-13-inch cake pan with cooking spray.

Add the molasses, mixing until incorporated. Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix each cup until just combined. With the mixer running, slowly add the water. Spread the dough out on a sheet pan, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until you&#39;re ready to roll it out (ideally overnight, three hours minimum). Keep gingerbread cool while working with it. Dust with flour to avoid sticking. Brush away excess flour after cutting. Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Apply even pressure on rolling pin to avoid variance in thickness. Cut out house pieces using your cardboard templates. A dough wheel works best. Use a paring knife for corners. Bake pieces in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes or until dough is set well. Crisp gingerbread is a must for a lasting structure. Allow pieces to cool completely before assembly-overnight is ideal. If pans are not level transfer warm pieces carefully onto the counter surface so they set completely flat. In the bowl of a mixer, blend the above ingredients together and mix on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. Keep covered with a damp towel to prevent a crust from forming on the icing. ASSEMBLY FOR GINGERBREAD HOUSES: Windows should be decorated before assembly. Colored flow icing, crushed candies, melted leaf gelatin, marzipan, etc. Mix royal icing and keep covered with a damp towel. Assemble house on the a 12-inch round base of your choice. Start with a front piece and a side piece using royal icing liberally on the inside. The 2 pieces should stand without assistance. Assemble remaining pieces in the same fashion. Roof pieces may need support to counteract gravity, sugar boxes, soda cans work well. Time to decorate your house. Necco wafers make excellent roof shingles. Chocolate covered raisins will build a chimney. Red hots, jelly beans, chocolate chips, gummi bears -- use your imagination in the candy aisle. Finish with royal icing and dust with snow-donut sugar looks best. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 73089,&quot;Grilled Pumpkin Pie One 15-ounce can pumpkin puree 1 1/4 cups heavy cream<br> 2/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3 large eggs<br> One 9-inch frozen pie shell in a metal pie pan, thawed<br> Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results). Meanwhile, gently whisk the pumpkin, cream, granulated sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, salt and 2 eggs together in a large bowl. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl and brush on the crust edge. Pour the filling into the crust. Place the pie on the indirect heat side of the grill. Cover and cook until it is starting to set around the edges, about 25 minutes, then rotate, cover and cook for another 25 minutes (the middle will still jiggle slightly). Move the pie to the direct heat side of the grill and cook for 3 more minutes to help crisp the bottom of the pie.

If you need to shorten the soaking time, soak the rice in warm (about 100 degree) water for 2 hours. The longer soak gives more flavor and a more even, tender texture, but the rice is perfectly edible with the shorter soak in warm water. Drain the rice and place in a steamer basket. Set the steamer basket over several inches of boiling water in a large pot or a wok. The rice must not be in or touching the boiling water. Cover and steam for 25 minutes, or until the rice is shiny and tender. Turn the rice over after about 20 minutes, so the top layer is on the bottom. Be careful that your pot doesn&#39;t run dry during steaming; add more water if necessary, making sure to keep it from touching the rice. Turn the cooked rice out onto a clean work surface. Use a long-handled wooden spoon to flatten it out a little, then turn it over on itself, first from one side, then from the other, a little like folding over dough as you knead. This helps get rid of any clumps; after several foldings, the rice will be an even round lump. Place it in a covered basket or in a serving bowl covered by a damp cloth or a lid. Serve warm or at room temperature, directly from the basket or bowl. The rice will dry out if exposed to the air for long as it cools, so keep covered until serving. Soak the rice in a container that holds at least twice the volume of rice: Cover the rice with 2 to 3 inches of room-temperature water and soak for 6 to 24 hours. If you need to shorten the soaking time, soak the rice in warm (about 100 degree) water for 2 hours.

From high above the bowl for even coverage, sprinkle over the onion pulp, 1 teaspoon of the curry powder, the onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of pepper and the thyme. Gently mix with your non-dominant hand until just combined. Form into 4 equal balls and let rest in the bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil, cover with plastic wrap and rest at room temperature 1 hour. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk the tomatoes, ketchup, honey, hot sauce and the remaining 2 teaspoons curry powder until combined. Preheat 4 personal-sized cast-iron pans over medium-high heat. Form each ball of beef into a patty and press each patty to fill the entire bottom of each pan; the patties will shrink as they cook. Cook until each patty easily lifts from the pan and a peek beneath reveals a golden-brown sear, about 5 minutes. Flip the patties, then immediately pour the tomato mixture evenly over each and jiggle the pans to settle the sauce. Using the back of a spoon, gently press a recess in the center top of each patty. Gently crack an egg into the center of each patty, resting the yolk in the recess you created. Cover all the pans with a large baking sheet. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and leave covered until a quick peek beneath reveals the whites are cooked and the yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Garnish each with a tiny sprinkle of salt over the yolks, a grind of pepper and a sprinkle of parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 73097,&quot;Sauteed Bananas with Tangy Sweet Cream 2 tablespoons butter 4 bananas, peeled and sliced in 1/2 crosswise and then lengthwise 1 orange, juiced 2 tablespoons sugar Dash salt Tangy-Sweet Cream, recipe follows 4 tablespoons sour cream 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: In a large saute pan, add the butter and melt it over medium-high heat. Add the bananas and saute until they begin to caramelize. Add the orange juice, sugar and salt and cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes. The bananas should be nicely browned, and the orange juice and sugar will have formed a glaze. (If needed, add a tablespoon of water.)

I always struggled with the underlying toughness of the leaves. I would smile and gulp down a lot of water while eating them! My favorite treatment for them now is to drop them in a hot pan with a splash of olive oil and a touch of chili flakes. The \\fork-garlic clove\\ trick adds a nice, light garlic flavor! They will lose a lot of volume so don&#39;t be afraid to overload the pan and watch it wilt. Cook for only a few minutes and serve immediately. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the escarole and season lightly with salt and chili flakes. Cook the escarole, stirring, from time to time, with the fork, until they are completely wilted, about 2 to 3 minutes. This will allow a \\hint\\ of garlic to touch the greens without overwhelming them. Drain and discard any liquid. Transfer the leaves to a kitchen towel and dry them off, slightly, before transferring them to a platter.

Put the flour in a bowl or container and add the seasoned salt, garlic powder, paprika and black pepper and mix to combine. Heat the canola oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Take a sprinkle of flour and put it in the fryer to test the oil. If it sizzles the oil is hot enough. Working in batches, dip the chicken in the flour mixture, coating both sides, and cook until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and reserve. Pour out the excess oil, leaving enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to low. Add 1 tablespoon of the flour mixture used for dredging, the butter and garlic and mix together well until the butter is melted. Add the cooking wine and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until reduced by half, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the cream and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened and reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze the juice of 1 1/2 of the lemons into the cream mixture, stirring constantly. Add the cheese and sugar, reduce the heat to very low, and cook until the cheese melts and the mixture begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Thinly slice the remaining 1 1/2 lemons into rounds and add them to the cream mixture. Stir in the capers and half the parsley. Bring a large pot of water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil. Let boil 7 minutes, then add the pasta and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Stir to prevent sticking and cook until al dente, about 7 minutes. Check the pasta in 5 minutes! Drain the pasta, add more oil to prevent sticking and divide among 4 plates. Top with the chicken and sauce, sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73109,&quot;Sazerac 3 dashes Peychaud bitters 3 dashes Angostura bitters 2 ounces bourbon 1 ounce simple syrup or 1 teaspoon sugar Splash Ricard Lemon peel garnish Instructions: In an ice-filled mixing glass, stir together 3 dashes Peychaud bitters, 3 dashes Angostura bitters, 2 ounces bourbon, and simple syrup or sugar.

When the shallots are translucent, add the clams, white wine, thyme and bay leaves. Cover the pot to steam the clams, and as they begin to open, add the mussels. Gently simmer, covered, until the mussels and remaining clams open, about 3 minutes. When all the shells are open, strain off the liquid and reserve, setting aside the shellfish to cool slightly until you can handle them. Shuck the meat out of all the shells, refrigerate and reserve for the sauce. Discard the vegetables and herbs. For the sauce: Cook the bacon in the same pot over medium heat to render the fat. This will help to make the roux later. When the bacon begins to brown, add 3 tablespoons of the butter, the garlic and shallots. Continue to sweat over medium heat until the shallots are translucent. Add the white wine and reduce until it&#39;s almost dry (au sec). Add the reserved shellfish stock and reduce by half. Remove from the heat and set aside on the stove. Melt the remaining 1 stick butter in a separate small pot or deep saute pan to its bubbling point and stir in the flour very well with a wooden spoon, incorporating it while removing clumps. Cook 3 to 5 minutes over medium heat while stirring regularly. Add the roux to the bacon pan, and place over medium heat. Add the cold milk to the hot roux while stirring constantly. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. You will have to monitor it carefully and stir frequently so the flour doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom (if it does, don&#39;t panic! You can remove the sauce, clean the bottom of the pot and put it back in... phew!) Simmer 10 minutes, then add the carrots, celery and fennel, and continue cooking until the raw flour taste has been cooked out and the vegetables are tender (they will add texture to the finished chowder), 10 minutes longer.

Remove from heat and sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar and flour over the surface of the liquid. Set aside without stirring, until foamy and rising up the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Whisk the butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture. Whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon to make a thick, shaggy, and slightly sticky dough. Stir in currants. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. Shape into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Put dough in bowl, turning to coat lightly with butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. (If you have a marker, trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic, and note the time to help you keep track.) To form the rolls: Butter a 9 by 14-inch baking pan. Turn the dough out of the bowl and pat into a rectangle about 16 by 8 inches. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions, about 2 ounces each, with a pizza wheel or bench scraper. (If you don&#39;t have a scale, divide the dough in half lengthwise, then in half crosswise. Cut each of those four sections into 3 equal-sized rolls.) Tuck the edges of the dough under to make round rolls and place them seam-side down in the prepared pan, leaving a little space in between each roll. Cover the pan with buttered plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the rolls rise almost to the rim of the pan and have more than doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap and brush the tops of the buns with beaten egg. Bake rolls until golden brown and puffy, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the rolls registers 190 degrees F, about 25 minutes. For the glaze: Stir together confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, lemon zest and vanilla until smooth. Transfer icing to a zip bag or pastry bag, and make a small cut in the corner of the bag. Ice buns in a thick cross shape over the top of the warm buns. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 73143,&quot;Creme de la Crepe 1 cup whole milk 1 large egg 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Pinch of salt 1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 kiwi, peeled and cut into small wedges 1/2 small mango, peeled and cut into sticks 1/2 cup raspberries<br> 3 tablespoons dulce de leche or caramel sauce Instructions: Make the crepes: Combine the milk, egg, flour, cocoa powder, confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 tablespoon melted butter, the vanilla and salt in a blender; pulse until smooth. Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with some of the remaining melted butter; set over medium heat. Pour in 1/2 cup batter and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan; cook until almost set, about 4 minutes. Flip with a rubber spatula and cook until set, about 2 more minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and let cool. Brush the skillet with more butter and repeat with the remaining batter to make 3 crepes. Make the filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and bake until toasted, about 10 minutes; let cool. Beat the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla in a bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Spread on the crepes, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle with the coconut. Starting about 1 1/2 inches from the bottom of each crepe, arrange the kiwi, mango and raspberries in horizontal strips. Fold the crepes over the fruit to cover, then tightly roll up. Chill until firm, about 1 hour. Cut the crepe rolls into pieces.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour with 1 cup of the sugar as well as the eggs until incorporated. The mixture will be very thick. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, the remaining cup of sugar and the salt. With a pairing knife, scrape the inside of the vanilla bean and place contents into the saucepan. Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally to prevent scalding. Remove from heat when the milk just begins to simmer. While whisking constantly, slowly pour about half of the milk in a thin stream into the flour mixture. Once the 2 mixtures are combined, continue whisking the combined flour and milk and return the contents to the saucepan with the remaining milk. Place the saucepan on medium heat while whisking constantly. Cook the mixture until it thickens, approximately 2 minutes. Immediately remove the pan from the heat as soon as the first bubble breaks the surface of the pastry cream. Pour the hot pastry cream into the strainer or food mill over a medium sized bowl. With a spatula, push the cream through the strainer or food mill. To prevent a skin from forming, place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the cream and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, or overnight. Have packaged puff pastry unrolled on cutting board.

Cover with 1 to 2 inches cold water and season generously with salt. The water should taste like the sea. TASTE IT! If the water is under seasoned at this point it will be hard to have a well seasoned end product. Bring the pot of water to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and garlic well and pass through a food-mill or ricer. DO NOT use a food processor or blender. It will result in a very sticky and rubbery end product. While passing the potatoes, bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Once the cream has come to a boil remove from the heat. While the potatoes are still hot add 1/3 of the cream and butter and stir vigorously into the potatoes. Repeat this process 2 more times until all of the cream and butter has incorporated. Taste the potatoes for seasoning and add salt, if needed. Serve immediately or cover with foil and keep warm in an oven on low heat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73157,&quot;Pineapple-Sage Tequila Sour 1/2 cup sugar 4 chunks pineapple 2 large sage leaves 2 ounces reposado tequila 1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice Instructions: Make the simple syrup: Bring 1/2 cup water and the sugar to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat.

Carefully trim the root ends off the onion, trim 1/2-inch from the top, and cut away any withered outer leaves. Position the grill 4 to 6 inches above the coals and lay a double folded square of aluminum foil on one side of the grill. Brush the onions lightly with the oil and season to taste. Lay the white part of the onion on the grill over the fire and the green part on the foil. Lay a heavy cast iron skillet over them to press the onions down onto the grill, so they will have nice grill marks. Grill them, turning occasionally, for 7 to 13 minutes, depending on the size of the onions. They are done when the white bulb is browned and well marked, and the green tops are soft. Remove to a warm serving platter and squeeze a little lime juice over the top. Serve warm, accompanied by the remaining lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73160,&quot;Steak House Chopped Salad 1 tablespoon olive oil or canola oil 1 1/2 pounds well-marbled steaks, such as hangar or flank Salt and ground black pepper 1/2 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1/3 cup buttermilk 1 small shallot, finely chopped or grated 1 garlic clove, grated or pasted 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Few dashes hot sauce 2 ounces blue cheese, crumbled as needed Salt and ground black pepper 1 large head romaine, roughly chopped 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, halved 4 to 5 radishes, coarsely chopped 1 ripe avocado, pitted and chopped</li></ol><p>Instructions: Place a heavy-bottomed skillet or a cast-iron skillet over medium heat with the oil.

If using charcoal, make sure you have a full layer of hot coals on the grate. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, garlic, dill, lemon zest, lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the oysters (oyster-side up!) on a platter. With two small spoons, place a small dollop (about 1 teaspoon) of the herbed butter on each oyster. Place lightly crinkled sheets of aluminum foil loosely on the grill grates. Place the oysters on the foil, making sure they&#39;re level so the butter doesn&#39;t spill out. (The foil keeps the oyster shells from tipping over.) Cover the grill with the lid, making sure the vents are open, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the butter comes to a simmer and the oysters are just heated through.

Move the oven rack to the bottom third of the oven. Divide the dough in half and set one half aside; cover it with a towel or plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a 10-inch round. Loosely drape the dough round over the rolling pin and transfer to a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough over the bottom and sides of the pan. Trim the edges to about 1/2-inch. Toss the fruit with the sugar, lemon, and cornstarch. Pile the fruit into the pie shell and dot with the butter. Roll out the reserved dough to a 9 to 10-inch round and lay it over the fruit. Trim, and crimp the edges. Cut 2 or 3 (2-inch) vents in the top of the pie and brush with the egg glaze. Put the pie on a baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling up through the vents, 50 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with aluminum foil if they brown too fast. Cool on a rack before serving. Serve with vanilla ice cream. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, and lemon zest in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and ice water and work that in with your hands. (Or do the whole thing in a food processor, pulsing a couple of times to combine the dry ingredients, then pulsing in the butter, and then the egg.) Check the consistency of the dough by squeezing a small amount together between thumb and forefingers: You want there to be just enough moisture to bind the dough so that it holds together without being too wet or sticky. If it&#39;s still crumbly, add a little more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. When you get it to the right consistency, shape the dough into a disk and wrap it in plastic. Put it in the refrigerator and chill for at least 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 73165,&quot;Olive Oil Blondies with Chocolate Frosting Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 2 cups flour<br> 2 cups lightly packed dark brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 cup olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/2 cup cocoa powder<br> 2 tablespoons heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> A pinch of kosher salt<br> Sprinkles, for topping, optional<br> Instructions: For the blondies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a large pan with straight sides and a lid (large enough to eventually hold all the chicken nestled in 1 layer), add the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to swirl, add the chicken pieces in batches, without crowding the pan. Cook until golden brown, flipping and browning on all sides. The purpose isn&#39;t to fully cook them here, just to get color. Remove the chicken to a plate. Immediately add the tomatoes to the pan and allow them to roast while resting for a few minutes, then shake the pan and stir to get another side of the tomatoes roasting on the bottom of the pan. Cook like this until the tomatoes are charred and begin to break apart and create a sauce, about 8 minutes. Add the black olives, cl flakes and garlic to the tomatoes. Then, nestle the chicken pieces back into the pan. Add enough chicken stock so the chicken is almost but not completely covered by the liquid (leave about 1/2 inch). Cover and lower to a simmer. Cook until the check of a garlic clove reveals it to be tender, or the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Bring the liquid in the pan back to a boil. Add the pasta and spinach and cook until the pasta is al dente, about 5 minutes (according to the timing on the package). Remove the pasta to serving plates or bowls.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 73199,&quot;Garlic-Stuffed Lamb Loin Bites 1 cup olive oil 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, toasted (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/3 cup fresh oregano leaves, chopped 2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1 1/2 pounds (trimmed weight) lamb loin, boned, fat and membranes removed (reserve tenderloins for another use) 1/2 cup Roasted Garlic Paste, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 metal or wooden skewers, soaked in water 30 to 60 minutes 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound whole garlic heads 1/2 cup pure olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a small skillet, heat the olive oil and chili flakes over low heat for 1 minute. Turn off the heat and add the oregano, garlic and lemon zest. Pour mixture out of the pan and into a bowl. Allow to cool. For the lamb skewers: Slice lamb loin lengthwise (as if filleting) into 2 pieces about 1/2-inch thick. Using a mallet or the heel of your palm, lightly pound meat to about 1/4-inch thickness then cut each in half lengthwise. Place meat in a non-metallic dish and pour reserved oregano marinade over the meat. Turn several times to coat, cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. When ready to cook, prepare grill or preheat broiler. Remove lamb from marinade and discard marinade. Spread about 1 tablespoon garlic paste on each of the lamb pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Roll meat lengthwise end to end and place on skewers. Brush with olive oil. Grill or broil to desired doneness, 10 to 15 minutes for medium-rare meat, depending on heat of grill. Turn meat occasionally to ensure even cooking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Peel the outermost layers of skin off the heads of garlic. Cut off the top 1/3 of the heads to open the cloves. Put the heads, cut sides up, in a small baking dish and pour the olive oil over them. Season with salt and pepper. Cover tightly, place in the oven, and roast until about 3/4 cooked, about 45 minutes. Uncover and return to the oven until the cloves begin to pop out of their skins and brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool. When garlic is cool enough to handle easily, squeeze the roasted garlic into a small bowl. Press against the skins very well to get out all the sweet roasted garlic you can. Add the oil from the baking dish and mix well until a paste forms. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 73200,&quot;Potato and Rajas Tacos 3 medium boiling potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 4 cups creamy rajas, recipe follows 1/2 cup olive oil 2 medium onions, halved and cut in 1/4-inch slices, lengthwise 4 medium red bell peppers, roasted, peeled, seeded and julienned 1 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup grated Manchego or Monterey Jack cheese 2/3 cup grated Cotija, Romano or Parmesan cheese 4 medium ripe tomatoes, cored, seeded and finely diced 1/4 red onion, minced 2 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded if desired and minced 1 bunch cilantro, leaves only, chopped 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice 3/4 teaspoon salt Pinch of freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil and cook the potatoes until just tender, being careful not to overcook, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, pat dry and spread in a single layer on a tray to cool. When ready to serve, heat the rajas in a medium saucepan over medium low heat, stirring frequently, just to heat through. Add the potatoes and stir occasionally until heated through. For potato and rajas tacos, toast 24 small Corn Tortillas and keep warm. For each taco, stack 2 tortillas and layer with the potato rajas mixture. Top with Salsa Fresca and an avocado slice and serve. In a large skillet heat the oil over medium heat. Saute the onions with the salt and pepper until they begin to wilt and brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the julienned red peppers and chiles. Pour in the heavy cream, bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook 4 minutes or until the cream begins to thicken. Stir in the grated cheeses and remove from the heat. Serve immediately. In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients. Stir and toss well, and serve. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator no more than 1 day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 73201,&quot;Lemon Broiled Chicken with Bulgur Salad 1 cup bulgur wheat Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup lemon juice (from 4 to 6 lemons) 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 small shallot, minced 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 8 boneless, skin-on chicken pieces (4 breasts and 4 thighs), trimmed of excess fat 1 cup halved grape tomatoes 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup packed chopped fresh mint 2/3 English cucumber, diced (about 1 cup) Instructions: Put the bulgur, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover immediately, remove from the heat and let stand until all of the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Position an oven rack in the top of the oven, put a baking sheet on the rack and preheat the broiler on low. (If the broiler has just 1 setting, preheat the baking sheet on a rack 8 inches from the broiler.) Add the lemon juice, mustard, garlic and shallot to a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Whisk in 1 teaspoon salt and a couple turns of ground black pepper. Drizzle in the olive oil, whisking until well combined. Pour half of the mixture into a large bowl or resealable plastic bag. Reserve the remaining half for the bulgur. Add the chicken to the marinade, turning to coat evenly. (The chicken is ready for cooking immediately, but you can also marinate it, refrigerated, for up to 12 hours before cooking.) Carefully remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard the marinade), sprinkle with salt and pepper and arrange skin-side up on the baking sheet. Broil until the chicken is crispy and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of each piece registers 175 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, toss the bulgur with the tomatoes, parsley, mint, cucumbers and reserved marinade. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the chicken to a large platter and serve with the bulgur salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 73202,&quot;Pimiento Cheese Pinwheels 8 ounces shredded yellow Cheddar 8 ounces chopped pimientos, very well drained<br> 2 ounces cream cheese<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne<br> 2 scallions, finely chopped<br> Kosher salt<br> 3 burrito-size flour tortillas (10 inches in diameter)<br> 4 1/2 cups loosely packed arugula<br> Instructions: Combine the Cheddar, pimientos, cream cheese, mayonnaise, cayenne, scallions and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Use a potato masher to mash the ingredients together to make a cohesive spread. Lay the tortillas out on a work surface and evenly spread one-third of the cheese mixture on each, leaving a 1-inch border along the edge. Top each with 1 1/2 cups of the arugula. Roll the tortillas tightly, tucking the arugula in as you go. Lay the wraps on a platter seam-side down and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Transfer the wraps to a cutting board. Trim off the edges, then use a serrated knife to carefully cut them into 1-inch rounds. Arrange the pinwheels on a platter and serve immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 73203,&quot;Rosemary Greyhound 1 cup sugar 4 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves<br> 6 ounces ruby red grapefruit juice 2 ounces vodka<br> 2 slices ruby red grapefruit, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the rosemary simple syrup: Combine the sugar, rosemary and 2 cups water in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Add the prosecco and bring to a simmer. Add the pears and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove the pears from the liquid and let cool. For the pecans: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Add the pecans and stir to coat. Simmer the pecans in the sugar mixture, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a piece of parchment paper and let cool. Chop the pecans and set aside. For the dressing: In a bowl, combine the oil, orange juice, vinegar and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and whisk together. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. For the salad: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add a swirl of olive oil and the pancetta. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is crisp. Transfer the pancetta to paper towel-lined plate to drain the fat. Tear the frisee into bite-size pieces into a large bowl and add the celery leaves and fennel. Add the pears. Pour in enough dressing just to coat and toss to combine. Taste and add more dressing if desired. Divide the salad among plates and garnish with a few pieces of pancetta and chopped pecans. Using a vegetable peeler, shave a few pieces of Parmesan over each salad. This recipe was created by a contestant during a cooking competition.

In another bowl, combine the warm water and 1/2 tablespoon barley malt syrup and whisk together, then whisk into the dry ingredients. Stir until it forms a ball, then fit the stand mixer with the hook and knead until smooth, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Let the dough sit at room temperature for an hour, then turn it out onto a clean work surface. Divide it into 12 equal pieces and stretch them into smooth balls, making sure to seal any dough seams well. Shape the bagels by sticking your thumb through the center of each ball and using your fingers to gently stretch a 1-inch hole. Cover the bagels with a towel and let rise for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons barley malt syrup. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats (grease well if using parchment), and lay out a clean kitchen towel near your pot of boiling water. Working with 4 bagels at a time, boil them for 1 minute on each side (use a timer for this). With a slotted spoon or spatula, transfer them briefly to the kitchen towel to catch any excess moisture, then transfer them to the baking sheets. Brush the bagels with the egg wash and sprinkle with dried garlic and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bake until golden and the garlic is toasty but not burnt, about 12 minutes. Let cool slightly. For the pizza bagels: Lower the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the bagels open and return to the lined baking sheets. Top each with a thin layer of sauce and 1 tablespoon shredded mozzarella, then use 1 banana pepper ring half to make a mouth, 2 olive eyes, a grape tomato nose and broccoli hair. Bake until the cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Top with freshly grated Parmesan and serve immediately.

Spread the mixture evenly over the ribs, pressing it into the flesh on all sides. Let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour or wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let sit, refrigerated, for up to 48 hours. When ready to cook the ribs, add the apple cider to a 6-quart Instant Pot?. Set the rack in the bottom of the pot and stand the ribs up on the rack so the bones are pointing up and down, coiling both rib racks around the perimeter of the pot.<br> Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 35 minutes.<br> After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for natural release. After 15 minutes, being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid.<br> Let the ribs sit, uncovered, to cool slightly, about 10 minutes (if you try and move the ribs while they are hot, they will fall apart). Transfer the ribs to a rack set inside a baking sheet and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes more.<br> When cool enough to handle, remove the bones; they will be loose enough to pull out of the rack with little or no resistance. Using small tongs, pliers or your fingers, pinch each bone on the larger, exposed end and jostle to loosen, then pull straight back to remove. You may have to hold the meat in place when you pull the bones. Discard the bones. Tent the ribs with foil and set aside until ready to sauce.<br> Meanwhile, remove the rack and set the pot to high saute. Add the barbecue sauce, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire and remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce is reduced and thickened, 20 to 25 minutes.<br> Position an oven rack in the highest position in the oven and set to broil on high.<br> Generously brush the ribs with the sauce and broil until the sauce is bubbling and browning in spots, 1 to 4 minutes, depending on your broiler.

Generously coat a heavy rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Place the beets on the baking sheet and spray them generously. Roast in the center of the oven until wrinkly and tender (a fork should slide through with no resistance), 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel them (wrap one at a time in a kitchen towel or wear gloves and gently massage the skin away). Slice the beets in half lengthwise. Place them flat-side down and cut each half lengthwise into 3 wedges. Keep the beets in separate bowls so the colors don&#39;t combine. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, sugar, salt and pepper. While whisking, stream in the olive oil. Add about a third of the dressing to each of the bowls of beets and toss to coat. In a separate bowl, toss the mint, arugula and remaining dressing to combine. Season with salt to taste.

Spray the bottoms 24 the cupcake molds with nonstick spray. Fill each with a double layer of cupcake papers. Alternatively, use a nonstick cupcake tin and spray the sides and bottoms with nonstick spray. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, \\cream\\ together the butter and granulated sugar until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and mix to blend. Add the brown sugar and continue mixing until both sugars are fully integrated and the butter soft, 3 to 5 additional minutes. With the mixer on a slow speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. With the mixer still on low speed, gradually incorporate about half of the flour mixture. When fully mixed, add half of the yogurt. Add the remaining flour and the remaining yogurt. The batter will be fairly dense and thick. Fill the tins a little more than 3/4 full. For a mold that has between 3 and 4-ounce holes, I like to use a 1/3 cup measure, leveled, to fill each one with the same amount of batter. When the tray(s) are full, tap the tray a few times on a flat surface to level the batter out and put the tray(s) in the center of the oven. Bake for 8 minutes then rotate the cupcakes halfway. Bake for an additional 10 minutes. A cake tester, when inserted into the center of a cupcake, should emerge clean. Remove the cupcakes from the oven and allow them to cool for 5 minutes. Gingerly remove them from the tins so the heat from it doesn&#39;t continue to cook the cupcakes and risk drying them out. Set aside to cool completely. In a small, heatproof bowl, melt the chocolate over a pot of simmering water (a double boiler). In a small saucepan, gently heat the sour cream over low heat. When the cream begins to simmer, shut off the heat and whisk in the vanilla. Use the tablespoon measure to measure out the cocoa powder and add it to the sour cream. Whisk to blend. Without cleaning the spoon, measure the corn syrup and add it to the chocolate. The layer of cocoa powder on the spoon will prevent the corn syrup from clinging to the spoon making it easier to add the precise amount of syrup. When the chocolate has melted, remove from the heat and allow the cream and chocolate to \\rest\\ for 5 minutes. Gently stir them together and set aside. When the cupcakes are cooled, spread the chocolate glaze over the tops and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Zinfandel]&quot; 73214,&quot;Enchilada Bean Dip with Corn 2 cans (14.5 oz. each) Del Monte?

Cut off the thin tail section of each cod fillet and place 1 fillet on each baking sheet, on the diagonal, if necessary, to make them fit. Season the cod with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the rosemary and thyme. Make alternating rows of chorizo, tomato, and mushroom slices across each fillet until the cod is completely covered. Scatter the garlic over the fish, then sprinkle it generously with cayenne. Sprinkle the parsley and scallions over the fillets and season with salt. Place the lemon slices down the center of each fillet and drizzle olive oil over all. (The recipe can be made to this point up to 2 hours ahead: refrigerate). Roast the cod for about 25 minutes until cooked through, spooning the oil that accumulates on the baking sheet over the fish from time to time. Halfway through the cooking, switch the positions of the baking sheets in the oven. To check for doneness, insert a skewer into the center of the fish for 5 seconds. The fish is done when the skewer goes in easily and then feels hot when touched to your lip. Spoon the oil on the baking sheet over the fish and squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon over each fillet. Slide the cod, with the parchment, onto 2 large serving platters. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</li></ol><p>&quot; 73218,&quot;Vegan Pumpkin Cheesecake with Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting and Apple Cider Reduction 4 cups vegan cream cheese 2 cups agave nectar or maple syrup 2 cups plain unsweetened soy milk 1 cup pumpkin puree 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) silken tofu 1 cup arrowroot powder 1 tablespoon agar powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 4 cups apple cider 1 cup unrefined sugar 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup Earth Balance Natural Buttery Spread, softened 1/2 cup baby Thai coconut meat or creamed coconut 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup vegan cream cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Let the brisket sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Have a smoker ready at 225 to 250 degrees F. Place the brisket on the grates, fat-side up, away from the coals. Cook for about 15 hours at the constant temperature listed. Add more wood as needed to keep the coals glowing. The internal temperature of the brisket should be about 190 degrees F when done. If you want, you can wrap with foil halfway through the cooking process to help with moistness if you are a novice smoker. Let the meat rest for about 30 minutes before using. For the cowgirl weiner: Warm up about 1/4 cup brisket and add a squirt of water and a pinch of salt to moisten and season. Cook the wiener in a pan with a few drops of oil and slowly brown on low heat. Toast the bun. When both meats are heated through, place the brisket in the bun and then lay the wiener on top.

Meanwhile, warm the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the cumin seeds. Once they&#39;re done popping, add the onion-tomato paste you just made, and saute until it thickens and deepens in color, about 10 minutes. Add the ground coriander, garam masala, paprika, and turmeric and saute about 30 seconds. Then add the yogurt, a little at a time so it doesn&#39;t curdle. Stir in the lime juice, chickpeas, artichokes, salt, to taste, and water. Cover and simmer 10 minutes. Taste for seasonings and serve garnished with cilantro. Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It&#39;s a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 73222,&quot;Spicy Cherry Brownies 1 cup butter, plus more for greasing 3 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> 4 eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 1 cup dried cherries<br> 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

For the roasted garlic soup: In a small pan, pour the olive oil and place each half garlic head HYPERLINK \\http://fxcuisine.com/zoom-image.asp?image=<a href="http://fxcuisine.com/blogimages/french-cuisine/garlic-soup/french-garlic-soup-07-1000.jpg&amp;t=%5C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://fxcuisine.com/blogimages/french-cuisine/garlic-soup/french-garlic-soup-07-1000.jpg&amp;t=\\</a> flat in the oil. Roast the garlic in the oven for about 40 minutes or until the garlic is soft throughout and nicely browned. Remove the skins from the garlic. Place half the cloves garlic in a large pot and mash them with 1/2 the infused garlic oil. Add the flour and cook on medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock and thyme and bring to a boil and then let simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. To prepare the artichokes: Start by cutting off the exterior leaves using a very sharp paring knife. Cut only at the base of the leaf and not into the hard heart. Once the heart is visible, cut the top of the artichoke off by first locating the top of the heart. Cook&#39;s Note: This is simply done by feeling the artichoke starting at the bottom of the artichoke and feeling progressively upwards. The heart will feel hard; where there is no heart, the leaves will feel noticeably soft. Cut through the leaves at the top of the artichoke using a sharp sturdy knife, like a chef&#39;s knife. Peel the stem of the artichoke using a paring knife. Scrape out the \\choke\\ or the fuzzy center of the artichoke heart. Rub with lemon to prevent the artichoke from discoloring. Cut the artichoke heart and stem into sections. Cook in boiling, salted, and lightly acidulated (with lemon juice) water until the hearts are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. In a pan, on medium heat the olive oil, add the artichoke and shallots. Saute for 5 minutes, until lightly caramelized. Season with salt and pepper. Add parsley. Keep aside. To assemble: Preheat the oven to broil. Brush the slices of bread with the remaining garlic-infused oil, garnish with the sauteed artichoke and cheese. Grill in the oven until the cheese is melted and slightly golden brown. When ready to serve, place an artichoke crouton in a shallow bowl, add a ladle of the roasted garlic soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 73243,&quot;Grilled Cheese and Watercress 1 cups watercress leaves, shredded or chopped 2 tablespoons dill pickle relish or sweet red pepper relish 8 sliced pumpernickel or marble bread 1/2 pound your choice of: Muenster, Havarti with dill or Leyden (Gouda with cumin seeds), thinly sliced 4 tablespoons butter, softened Instructions: Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat.

Pour batter into prepared baking dish, and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Cool completely. Line 8 (3-inch) ring molds with 1 1/2-inch high plastic ribbon. Cut the brownies with a 2 3/4-inch ring mold and slice horizontally into 1/4-inch thin slices. Place 1 slice into each ring. Caramel Coffee Cardamom Sabayon: In a small pot, caramelize 1 cup sugar. When the sugar has reached and amber color, add the crushed coffee beans and cardamom pods. Stir well to coat the beans and the pods. Deglaze with milk and bring to a boil. Let the mixture infuse for 20 minutes and strain through a fine mesh sieve. Melt the drained gelatin sheets in the warm coffee milk. In a mixing bowl, whisk the heavy cream until medium peaks form. Reserve in the refrigerator until ready to use. Combine the 6 tablespoons sugar and water in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil without stirring. Let the mixture boil to a softball stage or 240 degrees F. on a candy thermometer. Beat the egg whites with the salt and the cream of tartar until medium peaks form. When the syrup has reached the softball stage, add the syrup very slowly in a fine stream and continue to beat until the mixture is cool. Make a large ice bath with water and ice. Place the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and egg yolks in a medium size bowl, and set over a simmering pot of water. Cook over medium heat, whisking until the eggs are light and fluffy, about 8 minutes. Put the bowl over the ice bath and let cool completely. Fold the Italian meringue into half of the coffee milk. Fold the sabayon into the other half of the coffee milk. Fold the 2 mixtures together and finally, fold in the whipped cream. Using a pastry bag with a plain tip, pipe the coffee sabayon mixture into the prepared brownie molds about 3/4 of the way full. Freeze and remove the rings. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Hazelnut cookies: Bring 1/3 cup of water to a boil. Add the sugar and stir until completely dissolved. In a small bowl, mix the hazelnut flour, sugar syrup, and salt. Roll the mixture out until very thin, and place on a baking sheet. Bake until light golden brown, approximately 4 minutes. Remove from oven and cut out 3 inch round circles while still warm. Liquid caramel: Melt the sugar and salt in a large pot and cook to a dark caramel. Bring the water to a boil and pour into the caramel to deglaze. Remove from heat and set aside. Phyllo tops: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place 9 (3-inch) ring molds on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Lay a sheet of phyllo dough on a flat surface. Brush the sheet with melted butter and sprinkle some confectioners&#39; sugar on top. Add a second layer of phyllo and brush with melted butter. Cut out as many circles as possible from each sheet with a 5-inch round cutter and crumple the phyllo into a dome shape in the 3-inch molds. Dust the phyllo tops with confectioners&#39; sugar. Place in the oven to quickly caramelize the tops. This will happen very quickly. Remove from the oven and let cool. Coffee gelle: Combine water, sugar, star anise, vanilla bean, and pod in a medium size pot, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, add crushed coffee beans, and let infuse for 10 minutes. Strain the liquid and whisk in the drained gelatin sheets. Pour into small dome shaped flexible mold and freeze until set. To serve: An hour before serving, defrost the sabayon brownies in the refrigerator. Place a small dot of liquid caramel on the center of each plate. Place a hazelnut cookie on top of the caramel and put a sabayon brownie on top. Scoop out some of the sabayon center and pour in the liquid caramel. Sprinkle the caramel with some fleur de sel. Dust the phyllo tops with confectioners&#39; sugar and place on top of the coffee sabayon brownie. Place a coffee gelee to the side of the dessert and drizzle some of the liquid caramel around the dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 73305,&quot;Pork Belly in Pasilla Sauce 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup dry mustard<br> 1/4 cup paprika<br> 2 to 3 pounds pork belly slabs 1/2 cup duck fat, bacon fat or olive oil<br> 4 to 5 toes (cloves) garlic<br> 6 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 3 Roma tomatoes, halved and cored 1 large yellow onion, cut into 1-inch rings<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 8 ounces macadamia nuts<br> 6 toes (cloves) garlic, minced<br> 4 chiles de arbol, seeded and chopped<br> 2 pasilla chiles, seeded and chopped<br> 2 cups chicken stock or seasoned chicken broth<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus more as needed 2 teaspoons ground cumin<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 1 cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 jumbo carrots, julienned<br> 1/2 English cucumber, peeled and seeded 3 to 4 Granny Smith apples, preferably organic 1/4 head red cabbage<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt, or more as needed<br> 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, or more as needed<br> Pinch ground black pepper<br> 2 limes, juiced, or more as needed<br> 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped very finely<br> 3 to 4 quarts oil with a high smoke point, such as cottonseed, peanut or vegetable Pinch micro green mix Smoked Paprika Oil, recipe follows 1/2 cup smoked paprika 2 cups olive oil<br> Instructions: For the pork belly rub: Combine the brown sugar, salt, mustard and paprika in a bowl. For the pork belly: Trim the pork bellies and cut them into 6-inch squares. Score them horizontally and vertically on the fat side of the belly. (The score should be roughly 1/4-inch deep made with the tip of the knife.) Coat the bellies heavily with 1 cup rub and place inside a vacuum seal bag. Add the fat, garlic and thyme to the bag. Vacuum seal airtight and cure, refrigerated, overnight, or for up to 24 hours. Set a thermal circulator to 190 degrees F. Add the pork belly in the bag to the water bath. Cook 24 hours, then transfer to an ice bath and chill until the pork is under 40 degrees F. Remove the bellies from the bag, then pat dry with a towel and cut into roughly 6-ounce portions. Reserve for deep frying later. For the pasilla sauce: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place tomatoes and onions in a bowl and sprinkle with salt, pepper and olive oil. Place on grill and cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Place macadamia nuts in a baking pan and bake 5 to 10 minutes.

Puree in a blender until the sauce is very fine and smooth. Season to taste and finish the sauce with lime juice until the desired acidity has been reached. (Be careful when blending a sauce that is hot! It has a tendency to make a mess of your kitchen if you do not start off blending on slow. Also make sure blender is covered. Gradually work your speed up to full blast to get the velvet texture of the sauce, about 2 minutes total in the blender.) For the pickled carrots: Heat the vinegar, brown sugar and salt in a saucepot until it boils, 5 to 6 minutes. Pour the hot liquid over the carrots in a heatproof container and chill overnight. For the sour apple slaw: Julienne the cucumber on a mandoline into a bowl. Core the apples (leave the skin on) and julienne on the mandoline into the same bowl.

For the dough: Put the butter, sugar, flour, egg yolk and salt in a food processor and pulse for 30 to 60 seconds or until the mixture has a grainy consistency, or what I like to call the \\Parmesan cheese\\ stage. Add half of the water and pulse the food processor 2 to 3 times. The dough should start to come together, add the remaining water if needed. Check the consistency of the dough by clenching a small handful in your fist. If the dough stays together it is the proper consistency. If not, pulse the dough with a little more water. When the dough has reached the proper consistency, dump it out on a clean work surface. Using the heel of your hand, schmear the dough straight forward and roll it back with your fingertips. Repeat this process 1 to 2 more times, dust with flour if needed. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 to 1/4-inch in thickness. Lay the dough in the tart pan. Push the dough into the sides of the tart pan by rolling a small scrap of dough into a ball and pushing it into the dough. Roll over the top edge of the tart pan with the rolling pin to cut the extra dough from the pan and create a crisp edge. Cover the dough with aluminum foil and gently poke the foil into the side edges to fit the pan. This will help to keep the sides of the tart tall and straight as it cooks. Fill the tart shell with the dried beans and place in the preheated oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, remove the foil and beans and bake for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the tart shell from the oven and cool. The dough should be golden and crisp. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, zest, sugar, eggs and salt and whisk to a homogeneous consistency. Place in saucepan and bring to a medium heat. Cook, whisking, constantly until the mixture has thickened, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter, 2 pats at a time until it&#39;s incorporated and has a silky consistency. Pour the lemon curd into the prepared tart shell and bake in the preheated oven until the lemon curd has set, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting. To garnish: In a small bowl, mix together blueberries, sugar and lemon juice. Serve alongside tart slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73321,&quot;Chicken Scarpariello Extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound fennel sausage, cut into bite- size pieces 2 (3-pound) chickens, cut into 8 to 10 pieces with bone left intact Kosher salt 1 Spanish onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices 3 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 3/4 cup white wine 1 cup quartered hot cherry peppers 1/2 cup hot cherry pepper juice, from the jar 1 cup chicken stock, plus a little more if needed 3 sprigs fresh oregano, picked and chopped Instructions: Coat a large, wide pan with olive oil and bring the pan to a medium-high heat.

Pull out the spine, turn the chicken over and press down on the breast of the chicken to flatten it out to one thickness. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, garlic, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Put the chicken in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag in a rimmed dish. Pour in half of the marinade, reserving the rest for serving later.

Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season generously all over with salt and pepper; let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Place the chicken skin-side up on the indirect side of the grill with the legs facing the hotter side. Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh (avoiding the bone) reads 150 to 160 degrees F (almost cooked through), about 50 minutes. Move the chicken over to the direct-heat side of the grill. After 2 minutes, flip the chicken to char and crisp up the skin side, another 3 or 4 minutes. Check that the temperature in the thigh is now at least 165 degrees F. If it is not, then move the chicken back to the indirect side, cover and cook until the final temperature is reached. Remove from the grill; let rest 20 minutes before carving. Stir the scallions and dill into the reserved marinade.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. With a sharp knife, make 5 slits, at an angle and about 1 1/2 inches apart, on each side of the fish. Rub 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over each side of the fish, then season each side with Creole seasoning. Place the fish on the prepared baking sheet. Combine the kosher salt, herbs, lemon zest, and juice, orange zest and juice, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl. Mix well. Mound the mixture evenly on the surface of the fish, leaving the head and tail uncovered. With your fingers, firmly press the mixture into the flesh. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and cool for 2 minutes. With the back of a heavy spoon or a mallet, lightly pound the salt crust to crack it open, beginning at the tail end. Carefully pull off the salt crust. Then, with a small spatula or wide knife, remove the flesh from the bone on the top side of the fish. Remove the back bone, then serve the flesh from the bottom side of the fish.

Hollow out the center making a well in the middle of the flour with steep sides. Break the eggs into the well. Add the salt, and olive oil to the hollow center and gently mix together with a fork. Gradually start incorporating the flour by pulling in the flour from the sides of the well. As you incorporate more of the flour, the dough will start to take shape. With your hands or a bench scraper continue working the dough until it comes together. If the dough is too dry, add a little water; if too wet or sticky, add a little flour. Begin kneading the dough and keep kneading until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. At this point, set the dough aside, cover it with plastic, and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. You can store the dough in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours, but allow it to return to room temperature before rolling it out. Divide the pasta dough into 4 even sections. Keep each section covered with plastic wrap or a clean towel while you work with each one. Flour the dough, the rollers of a pasta roller (or your rolling pin), your hands, and the work surface. If using a pasta machine: Flatten 1 of the of the dough pieces between your hands or with a floured rolling pin until it forms a thick oval disk. Dust the disk, the roller, and your hands with additional flour. Flour a baking sheet to hold the rolled out finished pasta. With the roller on the widest setting, pass the pasta through the machine&#39;s rollers a few times until it is smooth. Fold the dough over into 1/3, and continue to pass through a few more times until the pasta is smooth again. Begin adjusting the pasta machine settings to become thinner, passing the dough through a few times at each setting. If rolling the pasta by hand: Flatten a dough piece into a thick oval disk with your hands. Flour a baking sheet for the rolled out finished pasta. Place the oval dough disk on a floured work surface, and sprinkle with additional flour. Begin rolling out the dough with a floured rolling pin working from the center of the dough outwards, constantly moving the dough and lifting it to make sure it&#39;s not sticking. Flavor and color variations: Cook&#39;s Note: All color additions should be added to eggs before incorporating into the flour. Keep in mind that you will need to add a little bit of flour to your basic pasta recipe to compensate for the additional liquid added Spinach Pasta Dough (green hue): Blanch 8 ounces (about 3 cups) spinach leaves. Puree in a food processor or blender until smooth. Press the spinach puree through a small strainer or chinois, removing the liquid before mixing with the eggs. Add 3 tablespoons spinach puree to the eggs before mixing. If the dough feels too sticky, add additional flour until a soft, silky dough is achieved. Tomato Pasta Dough (orange hue): Add 2 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste to the eggs before incorporating into the flour. Beet Pasta Dough (pinkish-red hue): Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roast 1 large beet in aluminum foil, about 45 minutes, or until tender. Peel the beet and puree in a food processor. Add the beet puree (about 4 tablespoons) to eggs before incorporating into the flour. Herb Pasta Dough (speckled): Mince 1/2 cup fresh herbs and add to eggs before incorporating into the flour. Squid Ink Pasta Dough (black hue): Add 1 tablespoon squid ink to the eggs before incorporating into the flour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 73359,&quot;Gwen&#39;s Cole Slaw 1/4 small head cabbage, cored and thinly sliced (2 cups) 1/4 small onion, diced 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sweet relish 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon Dijon-mayonnaise spread, such as Dijonnaise Instructions: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, onion, mayonnaise, relish, lemon juice, Dijon-mayonnaise spread and salt and pepper to taste.

With wire-mesh deep frying basket or other 1/4-inch metal screen, gently separate eggs from egg sack over bowl, by rubbing sack along screen. Take care not to scrape membrane from the egg sack, even if it means leaving some eggs behind. Pour brine mixture over eggs and allow to soak 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Soaking times for other salmon species: Sockeye or Red: 6 minutes; Pink or Humpy: 8 minutes; Coho or Silver: 10 minutes; King or Chinook: 14 minutes). While eggs soak, use tweezers to remove bits of membrane and broken eggshells. When soaking is complete, pour eggs into colander to drain. Rinse eggs quickly with cold water and drain for a few minutes. Cover colander with plastic wrap, place over bowl, allowing it to continue draining in refrigerator. After 8 to 12 hours, transfer the now-sticky eggs into glass bowl. Gently fold in just enough olive oil to make the individual eggs shiny and slick. Serving Suggestions: Salmon or red caviar prepared this way is much less salty than the commercial variety, allowing the sweet flavor of the fresh roe to emerge. Because of the lower salt levels however, it should be refrigerated and consumed within 3 to 4 days. Its mild flavor lends itself to serving with cream cheese and crackers. A traditional favorite is salmon caviar atop celery sticks stuffed with cream cheese. Salmon caviar is delightful when added to salads with creamy herb or ranch-style dressing. This mild version of salmon caviar will be a welcome alternative to the more strongly flavored ikura salmon eggs used in Japanese sushi or sashimi.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 73361,&quot;Celeriac Mash 2 celeriacs, peeled and roughly cut 2 potatoes, peeled and roughly cut 1 onion, large dice, divided 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: In a small sauce pot place celeriac, add water to cover.

(I like to make double triple batches of this and freeze the extra.) Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking pan with foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These serve as your handles to remove the fudge from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Pour the fudge into the pan and smooth it out, getting it in all the corners. Let the fudge come to room temperature, then put in the fridge for 3 hours or so. This will make it easier to cut.

Once ribs are coated in dry rub, place racks together, concave side to concave side. Wrap in foil, and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 24 hours. Build coals on 1 end of your grill and prepare grill for cooking. Preheat grill to 350 degrees F. Place ribs on the grill on the side opposite of the coals for indirect cooking. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at roughly 350 degrees F. You should cook the ribs until they are so tender that the meat falls off of the bone. Once ribs are tender, remove them from the foil and place them back on the grill, on the side opposite the coals and continue indirectly cooking for 30 to 45 minutes. This is a good time to add wood chips to the coals for smoke flavoring; apple, maple, hickory, or pecan wood chips particularly enhance the taste. Finally, transfer the ribs to the part of the grill directly over the coals and cook for 15 more minutes, or until the dry rub is caramelized. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 73369,&quot;Frozen Green Peas 1 gallon water, plus 2 quarts 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 pound fresh shelled green peas 1 1/2 pounds ice Instructions: Place the gallon of water and kosher salt into an 8-quart pot and place over high heat. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the peas and cook for 1 minute. Immediately drain in a colander and then transfer to a container with the 2 quarts of water and the ice. Shock for 1 minute. Pour the peas back through the colander and transfer to a half sheet pan lined with 3 layers of paper towels. Pat dry with additional paper towels. Place the tray in the refrigerator for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the paper towels and place the sheet pan on the bottom of the freezer. Leave the peas on the sheet pan for 1 hour. Once frozen, transfer them into a 1 gallon zip-top bag. Lay the bag flat on a counter and using a straw, suck out any remaining air in the bag.

Combine flour, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and sugar in a small bowl. Whisk together the cheese, eggs, milk, lemon juice and zest in a large bowl. Whisk the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until just combined. Brush the hot griddle with butter. For each pancake, pour approximately 1/4 cup measure of the batter on the griddle and cook on both sides until light golden brown. Repeat until no batter remains. Empty the contents of the lemon curd into a small saucepan and warm over low heat. Alternatively, remove the lid and place in a microwave oven on 50 percent power for 2 minutes, stopping after 1 minute to stir the curd. Drizzle a few tablespoons of the curd over the pancakes, top with fresh raspberries, and sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 73371,&quot;Ropa Vieja Dumplings 1 pound flank steak 1 green bell pepper, diced 1 orange bell pepper, diced 1 red bell pepper, diced 1 yellow bellow pepper, diced 1 white onion, diced 1 gallon beef stock, plus more as needed 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 cup hoisin sauce 1 cup tamarind syrup 1/4 cup soy sauce Two 14-ounce packages round dumpling wrappers 3 eggs, for egg wash 1/4 cup sesame oil 2 tablespoons crushed pork rinds 1 tablespoon mixed toasted sesame seeds (white and black) Instructions: In a large pot over medium heat, add the flank steak, bell peppers and onion. Add the beef stock and cilantro. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cover. Simmer, checking the liquid level once an hour and adding more beef stock if necessary, until the ropa vieja (steak) can be easily shredded upon picking up with tongs, 6 to 8 hours. Remove the ropa vieja and set aside to cool down, then shred. For the tamarind hoisin sauce: In a medium pan over medium heat, add the hoisin sauce, tamarind syrup and soy sauce. Cook, stirring, to allow the ingredients to emulsify, 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. For the dumplings: Grab a dumpling wrapper and brush egg wash over the edges only. Ball up a small amount of ropa vieja and place it in the middle of the dumpling wrapper. Crimp the two outer edges of the dumpling wrapper over the ropa vieja. Bring the top and bottom to the center over the ropa vieja and crimp with the other. (This should look like a small purse.) Fold the right edge to the backside and crimp. Fold the left side to the front and crimp. (The outcome looks like a mini money bag.) Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Place the dumplings in the freezer for 2 hours. Fill a medium pot three-quarters of the way with water and set over medium heat. Bring the water to a boil. Add 5 dumplings from the freezer and for the first minute, stir to prevent them from sticking to the bottom. Cook until the wrappers become translucent, then remove. Heat the sesame oil in a small nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and let sit for 30 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to drain the excess water from the dumplings as much as possible. Carefully transfer the dumplings to the pan (be careful; the water from the dumplings may make the oil splatter). Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, moving the dumplings continuously. This can be done by pushing the pan forward and back or by using tongs to flip the dumplings. Once the dumplings are seared on all sides, remove from the pan. In pasta bowl, add 1/4 cup of the tamarind hoisin sauce. Place the dumplings in the middle and garnish with the crushed pork rinds and sesame seeds. Save the remaining dumplings and sauce for another use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 73372,&quot;Cheat Sheet Roasted Vegetable Frittata 1 cup small broccoli florets (from about 1/2 head) 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 medium carrots, cut into 1/4-inch rounds (about 1 cup)<br> 1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch chunks (about 1 cup)<br> 1/2 red onion, cut into 3/4-inch dice (about 1 cup)<br> 1 dozen large eggs<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 cup shredded Cheddar Chopped fresh chives, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the broccoli florets with 2 teaspoons oil and some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Divide a nonstick half-sheet pan (13-by-18-inches) into four quadrants and place the broccoli in one quadrant in a single layer. Repeat with the carrots, bell pepper and onion, tossing each with 2 teaspoons oil and some salt and pepper and spreading in a single layer in its own quadrant. Roast until the vegetables are softened slightly and deeply browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the sheet pan and lower the oven to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs and cream in a large bowl and sprinkle with some salt and pepper. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon oil over the top of the vegetables, then pour the egg mixture over the top. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the eggs. Bake, rotating once halfway through, until the eggs are completely cooked through, puffed and just the slightest bit golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Slice the frittata into portions and use an offset spatula to remove from the pan. Sprinkle with chives and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 73373,&quot;Mini Beef Wellingtons 1 tablespoon salted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1 1/2 pounds beef filet, cut into 12 equal chunks<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 medium onion, diced finely<br> 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, minced<br> 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, stems removed<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> One 10-by-15-inch sheet frozen puff pastry, such as Pepperidge Farm, thawed All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 large egg yolk, beaten<br> 2 tablespoons sea salt flakes<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish<br> Bottled horseradish sauce, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over a medium-high heat. Sprinkle the steak chunks with salt and pepper. When the butter has melted and the oil is hot, add the steak chunks and sear them for about 45 seconds per side. (The steaks will only be partially cooked at this stage.) Remove and set aside to partially cool. Add the onion and thyme to the same skillet and stir. Allow to continue cooking while you place the mushrooms in a food processor and pulse until they are finely chopped. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are golden and the liquid has evaporated from the skillet, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, then add the Dijon mustard and stir to combine. While the mushrooms are cooking, lay out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the pastry to a 12-by-16-inch rectangle. Cut into 12 equal squares by cutting 4 long strips, then cutting each strip crosswise 3 times. Place a small amount of the mushroom mixture (known as duxelles) into the center of each square. Top each square with a piece of the steak. Fold the puff pastry up and over the steak, totally encasing the steak and mushroom mixture inside. Place on the prepared baking sheet with the smooth side facing upwards. Repeat with the remaining pastry, duxelles and steak. Brush each bundle with the egg yolk and sprinkle with the sea salt. Bake until golden, 16 to 18 minutes. Allow to cool slightly. Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve with the horseradish sauce. Enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73374,&quot;Apple Cider-Cured Smoked Salmon 1 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup salt 4 cups apple cider or juice 2 cinnamon sticks 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon whole allspice 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 bay leaf 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 6 sprigs thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1 large salmon fillets (about 1 pound each), skin and pin bones removed A small bundle of wood chips or chunks Instructions: To make the brine: In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, salt, and apple juice and bring to a boil. Add the remaining brine ingredients, remove from the heat, and cool. This brine can be made 2 to 3 days in advance and kept in the refrigerator. Submerge the salmon fillets in the liquid brine for at least 6 hours or overnight, refrigerated. Remove the salmon from the brine and place, uncovered, on a wire rack set in a sheet pan. Refrigerate the fillets for at least 6 hours, or overnight, to dry them out. (A dry fillet will take on smoke quicker than a moist fillet) To smoke the salmon: In an outdoor grill, make a small fire using mesquite charcoal or briquettes. Once the fire has burned down to a hot bed of coals, after about 1 hour, place the soaked wood on the coals. Position the grate 8 to 12 inches above the smoking wood and place the salmon fillets on the grate. Cover the grill and shut any open-air vents. After 5 minutes, check the heat of the grill; large fillets will be cooked and smoked through in approximately 30 minutes if the heat is low, about 300 to 350 degrees F, while a hotter fire will cook the fillets in 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the salmon hot off the grill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 73375,&quot;Holy Roller Meatloaf Sandwich 1 loaf Holy Roller White Bread, recipe follows 4 ounces unsalted butter 1 Holy Roller Meatloaf, recipe follows 15 slices Swiss cheese, optional 1 pint Holy Roller Horsey Sauce, recipe follows 1 quart Quick Pickles, recipe follows 1 quart Crunchy Cheese, recipe follows 2041 grams all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting 141 grams sugar 71 grams yeast 50 grams salt 510 grams bread flour 1389 grams milk 284 grams eggs, plus an additional egg for egg wash 510 grams butter, cubed and at room temperature Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 1 pound stale white bread 1 1/2 cups whole milk 8 eggs 2 cups grated Parmesan 7 teaspoons ground black pepper 1/4 cup minced garlic 4 large shallots, minced 1 bunch fresh parsley, minced 4 1/2 pounds 80/20 ground beef 2 1/2 cups sour cream 1/4 cup prepared horseradish 2 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 5 pickling cucumbers 1 cup apple cider vinegar 2 teaspoons yellow mustard seed 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar 2 cups white distilled vinegar 1 1/4 teaspoons celery seed 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 1 cup shredded Parmesan Instructions: Slice two 1-inch-thick pieces of bread and toast in a pan with butter.

Gradually spoon in the roux until your desired thickness is achieved. After each spoonful, let the mixture come to a simmer so you can see the full effect of the thickening. Once desired thickness is achieved, add all the seasonings and bring back to a simmer. Be careful not to boil vigorously, gumbo should be cooked at a gentle simmer the whole way through. Add the onions, bell peppers, celery, and tomatoes. Adjust seasonings, to taste. Once the gumbo comes back to a soft boil, add crab legs, littlenecks, and scallops and cook for 15 minutes, or until the mixture again reaches a soft simmer. Finally, add your okra, shrimp, and green onions and cook until all seafood is cooked through and flavors are combined, about 15 to 20 minutes. Discard any unopened clams. Making gumbo is a time consuming process. It would be best to make your gumbo a day ahead; this will allow all the flavors to marry well. Serve your gumbo over white rice and make sure you don&#39;t forget the file powder. Enjoy! In a pot over medium heat, add the butter and melt. When the butter is melted, stir in the flour.

Layer with spoonfuls of Katie\\u2019s Cincinnati-Style Chili, a generous drizzle of queso, some of AG\\u2019s Pickled Tomatoes and Onions, a drizzle of sour cream and finally some hot giardiniera. Serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Split each pita pocket into 2 rounds, then cut each round into chip-size triangles. Lay the wedges in a single layer on a baking sheet. Brush with the melted butter, then season with the za\\u2019atar and some salt and pepper. Bake, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet. In a stockpot or Dutch oven, combine the beef (do not brown first), tomato sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, cocoa powder, sugar, salt, cinnamon, cumin, garlic salt, allspice, pepper, cayenne, cloves, bay leaf, onions and 2 cups water. Mix until combined. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for approximately 2 hours. Stir in the vinegar and simmer another 30 minutes. In a saucepan, bring 2 cups water to a simmer over medium heat with the vinegar, sugar, salt, coriander, mustard, allspice, bay leaves, cinnamon and garlic. Take off the heat and let cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, poke holes in the top of the tomatoes with a skewer. Put the tomatoes and onions in a large mason jar. Pour the hot vinegar mixture into the jar. Cover and refrigerate. Store covered in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73412,&quot;QATEST44 1 cup rice 2 cup mik 1 cup haldi Instructions: method methos &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73413,&quot;Chocolate-Covered Toffee 1 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butte 2 cups granulated sugar 3/4 cup brown sugar 3/4 cup water 2 tablespoons molasses 2 tablespoons instant coffee powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 pound bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, melted Toasted nuts, optional Sea salt, optional Instructions: Prepare a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or greased parchment or wax paper. In a large sized heavy-bottomed sauce pan, with a candy thermometer attached, bring all the ingredients, excluding the chocolate, to a boil over medium low heat. Continue to cook and stir the mixture until it reads 275 degrees F on the candy thermometer. The mixture will be much thicker. Stir constantly until it reaches 315 degrees F, which will happen pretty quickly. Remove it from the heat and stir until very smooth, just a few seconds. Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet. Using a spatula, spread the toffee out, working quickly because the toffee will set fast. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, VERY GENTLY (you don&#39;t want to cut so deep that it actually reaches the bottom or you may destroy your silpat) score the toffee into bite sized pieces. You should get about 72 pieces. Again work quickly so the toffee doesn&#39;t set before you are done. Allow the toffee to sit until it is room temperature and then break apart the pieces. Melt the chocolate over a double boiler until perfectly smooth. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to just above room temperature. If the chocolate is too hot it will run off the toffee and not give you a nice coating, if it is too cold it will be too thick to work with. Set up a second baking sheet with a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Drop a piece of the toffee into the chocolate. Use a fork to flip the toffee over to coat the other side. Lift the covered toffee from the chocolate and shake gently to allow the excess to fall away. In order to get a nice smooth bottom, you want to scrape the bottom of the fork on the edge of the bowl, before laying it on the parchment to harden. If you want to sprinkle with toasted nuts and sea salt, this is the time. Continue dipping until they are all covered in chocolate. Allow them to sit out in a cool spot to set up or you can set them in the refrigerator for a few minutes until they are firm.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine 2 boxes of the pound cake mix, 1 stick of the butter, 4 of the eggs, 1 can of the pumpkin puree and 2 teaspoons of the pumpkin pie spice. Mix with a handheld electric mixer on high speed until blended, about 1 minute. Pour into the prepared Bundt pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then unmold onto a wire cooling rack. Repeat the process to make a second Bundt cake. Once the cakes are cooled, level off the bottoms with a serrated knife so the cakes will sit flat. Place one of the cakes cut-side up and spread the vanilla frosting over it. Place the second cake, cut-side down, on top to form a pumpkin. For the glaze: In a medium bowl whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream cheese, milk and food coloring. (The glaze should be a bright orange color; add a few more drops of food coloring if needed.) The mixture will be very thick but still pourable. Place the pumpkin cake on a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack. Slowly pour the glaze over the top, moving in a circular motion around the top of the cake and letting the glaze drip down the sides. Set aside until set, about 1 hour. Wrap some fruit leather around the green ice cream cone and press it into place upside down on the cake to form a stem. Dust a work surface with confectioners&#39; sugar, place some fruit leather on top, and cut out a leaf with a leaf-shaped cookie cutter. Press the leaf into place on the cake near the stem. For the graveyard: Spray an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment; spray the parchment. Prepare both boxes of brownie mix according to the package instructions and pour into the prepared baking sheet. Bake according to the package instructions. Let cool completely, then remove from the pan and place on a large cutting board. Frost the top of the brownie sheet with the chocolate frosting. Slice about 60 of the chocolate ladyfingers in half crosswise. Press the halved cookies, cut-side down, side-by-side around the top edge of the frosted brownie sheet to form a fence. On one of the long sides of the brownie sheet, leave a 3-inch opening in the fence to create an entrance. Place 2 whole ladyfingers on either side of the opening to form the gate entrance. Place another whole ladyfinger on top of the two ladyfingers to make the top of the gate, using a little bit of frosting to adhere it. Cover the top of the frosted brownie with the crumbled chocolate cream-filled cookies to make dirt. Place the pumpkin cake in the center of the graveyard. To make the gravestones, place the rectangular cookies and vanilla wafer sandwich cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spray both sides of the cookies with the silver spray food coloring. Use a knife to cut slits into the brownie to hold the gravestones. Carefully place the gravestones into the slits. Place the small candy pumpkins and marshmallow ghosts in the graveyard around the pumpkin.

Separate the heads of roasted garlic into cloves and squeeze the roasted garlic out of the peels. Place the garlic in a small bowl and mash with the back of a fork until mostly smooth. Add 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the rosemary and thyme, and stir to blend. Pat this mixture evenly over the top and sides of the roast. Place the trimmed strip of fat over the garlic-herb mixture and tie with kitchen string in several places to secure the fat onto the top of the roast. Season the roast all over with the remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Place the roast in a roasting pan and add 1 1/2 cups red wine and 1/2 cup beef stock to the bottom of the pan. Roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to roast to the desired degree of doneness, about 18 minutes per pound for rare and 22 minutes per pound for medium. Let stand at least 5 minutes before carving. De-fat the pan juices and serve alongside the beef. If making au jus, place the roasting pan on the stove burners over medium-high heat. Add 1 cup red wine and scrape the browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add 2 cups beef stock and season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Strain the sauce through a sieve to remove the solids before serving.

Arrange the tomato slices on a baking tray. Add the mushrooms. Drizzle over the olive oil, tamari and Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle over the garlic power and mixed herbs and put under the broiler until they release their juice and become succulent and cooked through, about 10 minutes. For the hash browns: Grate the potatoes through the large holes of a box grater or use a food processor with the grater blade. Put the grated potato into a colander and rinse under cold water to wash away the starch (this allows them to crisp up more when cooking). Shake dry and then lay onto a clean kitchen towel and roll up tightly to squeeze out excess water so the potatoes dry. (This is another trick that ensures the potatoes crisp up when cooking\\u2014if they are wet they will remain soggy!) Now heat the olive oil in a 12-inch flame-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Lay the grated potato evenly onto the base of the pan and sprinkle over the sea salt. Push the potato firmly and evenly down into the pan with a spatula. Allow the potatoes to cook undisturbed for 10 to 15 minutes. Then, using a spatula, carefully check that the bottom is browning and crisping up nicely. Allow to cook further until brown and crispy on the bottom. For the cumin black beans: In the meantime, heat the olive oil in a second smaller skillet over medium heat. Add the beans, sprinkle over the cumin and stir fry to cook through and infuse the beans with the cumin, 2 to 3 minutes. Move the grilled mushrooms and tomatoes out from under the broiler and place on the bottom shelf of the oven to prevent overcooking and keep them warm until the hash brown is ready. Place the skillet under the broiler to brown the top of the potatoes until golden and crispy, 10 to 15 minutes. For the garnish: While the hash browns are broiling, peel and thinly slice the avocado. Put the avocado on a plate, squeeze the lime juice over to stop it from browning and sprinkle with a small pinch of sea salt to flavor. Once the potato is all brown and crispy on top, remove it from the broiler (remember the handle will be hot, so use an oven mitt!). Slide the hash brown gently onto a chopping board or serving platter.<br> Remove the tomatoes and mushrooms from the oven and rewarm the black beans.<br> To assemble: Spoon the beans on top of the potato hash brown. Sprinkle on the scallions. Place the avocado slices on top of the scallions. Arrange the cooked mushrooms and tomatoes as the next layer, keeping the grilling juices to spoon on when serving.

Fill a large pot with 1 gallon water. Add the garlic, fennel seeds, juniper berries, peppercorns and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the salt and brown sugar and let cool to room temperature. Brine the pork. Put the pork belly in a large roasting pan and pour the brine over it. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours. Make the rub. Toast the fennel seeds, juniper berries and peppercorns in a medium skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pulse a few times in a spice grinder until coarsely ground. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the nutmeg, thyme and garlic. Spice the pork. Remove the pork belly from the brine and pat it dry. Spread the rub on the flesh side of the pork belly, using just what adheres; you may have some rub left over. Put the pork belly skin-side up on a large rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, 24 hours to dry it out. Roll the pork. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. (If you have a convection setting, use it; preheat to 450 degrees F.) Flip the pork belly so it&#39;s skin-side down. Starting at a long side, roll into a cylinder. Secure the roll with kitchen string: Tie separate pieces of string around the roll, about 3/4 inch apart. Prick the pork all over with a skewer; this helps render the fat so the skin gets crisp. Roast the pork. Put the pork belly on a rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Tuck 4 upside-down spoons around the pork to keep it from rolling around. Roast 30 minutes, using a baster to baste the pork with the drippings and rotating the pan every 10 minutes. Turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for convection) and continue roasting, rotating the pan every 15 minutes, until the pork registers 155 degrees F on a thermometer, about 1 1/2 more hours. Slice the pork. Let the pork rest 30 to 40 minutes, then cut off the string and slice about 3/4 inch thick. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 73424,&quot;Two-Nuts Chocolate Torte 5 1/2 ounces shelled and peeled almonds 5 1/2 ounces shelled walnuts, finely ground 11 ounces semi-sweet chocolate 1 heaped teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder 9 ounces butter 3 1/2 ounces sugar 6 large free-range eggs, separated Salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.

For the pickled red onions: Combine the vinegar, sugar, salt, cl and 1 cup water in a medium nonreactive saucepot and bring to a boil. Place red onion in a bowl. Pour the vinegar solution over the onions and let sit for 1 hour. To finish: Heat a large cast-iron pan over high heat until smoking hot. Add oil, then spread the duck meat in the hot pan to caramelize. (Be careful, as the sauciness of the duck will induce splattering!) Don&#39;t disturb the meat; let it stick to the bottom just a little bit. After a minute or two, scrape the meat off the bottom with a metal spatula and mix well. Add the scallion-cilantro mixture and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously. Remove duck meat from pan. Divide duck filling evenly among the taco shells. Add several slivers of pickled red onion to each taco. Sprinkle each taco generously with queso fresco. Serve without delay. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 73429,&quot;Crispy White Beans with Chili Oil 8 cups white beans, cooked 3/4 cup buttermilk 3/4 plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup chili oil 1 cup Arborio Rice Coating, recipe follows 2 tablespoons thinly sliced garlic Grey salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon thinly sliced serrano or jalapeno cl 3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves 1 tablespoon julienned lemon zest Instructions: In a bowl, let the beans soak in the buttermilk for a few minutes, then drain in a sieve. Place the sieve over a bowl. Heat 3/4 cup olive oil and the chili oil in a 10-inch skillet over high heat. While the oil is heating, sprinkle the coating over the beans and shake in the sieve to coat the beans well. Repeat with the coating that falls into the bowl. Don&#39;t worry if they don&#39;t absorb all the coating. Carefully add the beans to the hot oil, spread them into an even layer, and cook without stirring until they are browned and crisp on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn with a spatula and brown on the other side, another 5 to 6 minutes, adjusting the heat so they don&#39;t burn. When they are evenly browned, add sliced garlic and brown for another 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add chiles to the pan, and continue to fry for another 15 seconds before adding the sage. With a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to paper towels to drain. Saute until the leaves turn crisp, about 1 minute. Top with lemon zest, then remove from the heat. Chef&#39;s Notes: The Arborio Rice Coating is by far the best coating I know for anything fried. It gives an especially crisp crust to fried fish fillets, squid, shrimp, eggplant and veal cutlets. You may as well make a lot because it keeps well in the freezer, and it&#39;s hard to grind less than 1 cup of rice in a blender. If you have a spice mill, you can halve the recipe. Arborio Rice Coating is one of the few places I use table salt. Sea salt and kosher salt are too heavy to stay evenly distributed in the coating. Bringing the beans up to a simmer slowly helps keep the skins from splitting. Arborio Rice Coating: 1 cup Arborio rice 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup semolina 2 tablespoons table salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Grind the rice in a blender until very fine. Put it in a bowl and add the all-purpose flour, semolina, salt and pepper. Toss until well blended. Store in a sealed container in the freezer for maximum freshness. Yield: about 5 cups &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 73430,&quot;Turtle Soup 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter 2 1/2 pounds turtle meat, see note, cut in medium dice (beef, or a combination of lean beef and veal stew meat may be substituted) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 medium onions, cut into medium dice 6 stalks celery, cut into medium dice 1 large head garlic, cloves peeled and minced 3 bell peppers, any color, cut into medium dice 1 tablespoon ground dried thyme 1 tablespoon ground dried oregano 4 bay leaves 2 quarts veal stock 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 bottle (750ml) dry Sherry 1 tablespoon hot sauce 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 large lemons, juiced 3 cups tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 10 ounces fresh spinach, washed thoroughly, stems removed, and coarsely chopped 6 medium eggs, hard boiled and chopped into large pieces Instructions: Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a large soup pot over medium to high heat. Brown the meat in the hot butter, season with salt and pepper, and cook for about 18 to 20 minutes, or until liquid is almost evaporated. Add the onions, celery, garlic, and peppers, stirring constantly, then add the thyme, oregano, and bay leaves, and saute for 20 to 25 minutes, until the vegetables have caramelized. Add the stock, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, periodically skimming away any fat that comes to the top. While the stock is simmering, make a roux in a separate pot: Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a small saucepan and add the flour a little at a time, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Be careful not to burn the roux. After all the flour has been added, cook for about 3 minutes until the roux smells nutty, is pale in color, and has the consistency of wet sand. Set aside until the soup is ready. Using a whisk, vigorously stir the roux into the soup a little at a time to prevent lumping. Simmer for about 25 minutes. Stir to prevent sticking on the bottom. Add the Sherry, bring to a boil, add the hot sauce and the Worcestershire, and simmer, skimming any fat or foam that comes to the top. Add the lemon juice and tomatoes, and return to a simmer. Add the spinach and the chopped egg, bring to a simmer, and adjust salt and pepper as needed. This soup freezes well. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73431,&quot;Chicken Thigh Fricassee 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 onion, diced<br> 4 stalks celery, diced<br> 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> 2 cups chopped fresh tomato<br> 1/2 cup vermouth<br> 2 quarts chicken broth<br> 1 tablespoon fresh thyme<br> 2 cups roasted red peppers, julienned<br> 1 roasted pasilla pepper<br> Instructions: Heat the olive oil and butter in a large Dutch oven over high heat.

If the peas are not submerged in liquid, add just enough water to cover them. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for about 7 to 10 minutes, or until the onions are soft enough to puree and the peas are still bright green. While the peas are cooking, grill the bread. Heat a grill pan over high heat for 3 minutes. Pour some olive oil onto a large plate. Sprinkle oil with salt then dip pieces of bread quickly on both sides into the oil. Grill bread until slightly charred and hot, about 3 minutes per side. Using an immersion blender, standing blender*, or food processor, puree the soup until smooth and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Serve each bowl with a dollop of sour cream on top and grilled bread on the side. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73434,&quot;Mashed Potatoes with Kale 5 large russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch pieces (about 4 pounds) 2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, diced 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced One 12-ounce bunch kale, stemmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature (about 8 ounces) 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1/2 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 3/4 cup grated Parmesan 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for seasoning Instructions: For the potatoes: Combine the potatoes, garlic, salt and butter in a 5-quart saucepan with enough cold water to cover.

Lightly grease a third of an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan with butter. Toss the shrimp with the melted butter, 1 teaspoon of the thyme, a third of the minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl until well coated; set aside. Mix the Parmesan, 1/3 cup of the heavy cream, remaining 1 teaspoon thyme, half the remaining garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Arrange half of the potato slices in a single, overlapping layer on the buttered part of the sheet pan and pour the heavy cream mixture over the top. Top with the remaining potato slices. Cover the potatoes with foil and bake until tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 17 minutes. Whisk together the cream cheese, remaining 1/3 cup heavy cream, remaining garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Fold in the spinach until well coated. Divide the mixture between two 4-inch ramekins and press the spinach down so that it is flat and the cream mixture is pooling a bit on top. Remove the pan from the oven, remove the foil and sprinkle the potatoes with the Gruyre. Put the steaks down the middle of the pan and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Put the ramekins on one end of the empty third of the pan so that they are side by side. Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle of the steak registers 95 degrees F, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and turn on the broiler. Create 2 hearts with the shrimp on the pan beside the ramekins by connecting the tails. Broil until the steaks start to turn brown in some spots, an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle of the steak reaches 125 degrees F (for medium rare), the shrimp are opaque and the cheese on the potatoes turns golden and starts to crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Slice and serve the steak on plates alongside the shrimp, potatoes and creamed spinach. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 73443,&quot;Individual Chicken Potpies 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter 1 medium onion, finely diced 2 medium carrots, finely diced 1 stalk celery, finely diced 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed 1/4 cup dry white wine (or chicken broth) 2 cups shredded or chopped cooked chicken breast 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup half-and-half 2 rounds refrigerated pie crust 1 large egg Instructions: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring the vegetables around, until they start to soften, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir to combine. Cook the flour-coated veggies for 1 minute, then pour in the chicken broth (and wine, if using!) and stir to combine. Let it heat up and start to bubble and thicken, about 3 minutes. Stir in the chicken, then add the turmeric and thyme, then season with salt and pepper. Add the half-and-half, then stir the mixture and let it bubble up and thicken, about 3 minutes. If it seems overly thick, splash in a little more broth. Turn off the heat and let the filling cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, roll out the pie crusts slightly and cut out 8 dough circles just a bit larger than the pie pans (if using a muffin tin, you&#39;ll need sixteen 3 3/4-inch circles). Press a dough circle into each pie pan (or 8 muffin cups), making sure the dough comes almost to the top of each pan. Fill the pies with the chicken mixture. Lay a second round of dough over the top of each pie. Press the dough so that the edges meet, then use a fork to seal the edges. Mix the egg with 2 teaspoons water and brush it all over the surface of the crust. (Discard any extra egg wash.) Cut small vents in the surface of the crusts. If you&#39;re baking the pies right away, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, place the pies on a baking sheet and bake 25 to 30 minutes, until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbly.

Pour the mixture into a 12-inch wide, 2 1/4-inch deep nonstick skillet, stir in the bay leaves and submerge the wings in the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours. Meanwhile, make the Banana Ketchup: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ginger, turmeric, allspice, garlic and jalapeno and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring until lightly caramelized, about 1 minute. Add the mashed bananas, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce and rum, if using, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Scrape the sauce into a bowl, press a sheet of plastic wrap against the surface and let cool. You should have about 1 cup. Remove the skillet from the refrigerator and place over high heat. Once the marinade begins to bubble, cook the wings, gently moving them around and flipping occasionally, until cooked through, about 25 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the chicken wings to a bowl and set aside. Stir the onion into the sauce and continue cooking over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced to a glaze and the onions are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the glaze and onions over the chicken wings and stir to coat evenly. Transfer the wings to a serving platter and top with parsley. Serve with banana ketchup on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 73448,&quot;Roast Prime Rib of Beef with Horseradish Crust 1 bone in prime rib beef roast, 3 ribs, about 6 pounds 5 garlic cloves, smashed 1/4 cup grated fresh or prepared horseradish Leaves from 2 fresh rosemary sprigs Leaves from 4 fresh thyme sprigs 1/2 cup kosher salt 1/4 cup freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 2 cups canned chicken or beef broth Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the beef in a large roasting pan with the bone side down. (The ribs act as a natural roasting rack.)

For the lemon aioli: Add the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon zest and juice, salt and pepper to a medium bowl. Stir to combine and adjust the seasoning as needed. Set aside until ready to serve. Preheat a deep-fryer or several inches of oil in a Dutch oven to 375 degrees F. For the flour seasoning: Add the flour, paprika, salt and pepper to a large bowl. Drain the calamari and put into the flour mixture, making sure each piece gets coated with the flour. Dump all the contents into a colander and shake off any excess flour. Line a dish with paper towels and set aside. In batches, add the lemon slices and calamari to the preheated oil and fry, mixing with a slotted spoon to prevent the calamari from clumping together, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Right before you take the calamari and lemon out of the fryer, toss in the parsley leaves carefully; this will cook very fast and can splatter, so stand back. Take all the contents out of the fryer to the lined dish and season with salt.

Place over medium-high heat and bring it up to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and poach slowly until garlic cloves are very soft, about 1 hour. Strain the garlic out of the oil, reserving the garlic and oil separately. Place the strained garlic into a food processor and puree until silky smooth, about 1 minute. For a richer, smoother puree, add some garlic oil back in and process to emulsify. Adjust seasoning to taste. For the soup base: Preheat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and 1/2 cup of the reserved garlic oil and sweat, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the fennel and cook, 1 minute more. Add the garlic, red and yellow peppers, bay leaves and saffron, stirring. Cover and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the cover and add the diced tomatoes and additional stock if using (if you desire a lighter soup). Bring back to a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes, then season to taste. For the bouillabaisse: Bring the soup base to a boil, then stir in 3 tablespoons of the reserved garlic confit puree and add the clams.

Top with a second sheet of filo and brush with butter. Place a third sheet of filo crosswise to cover half of the filo layers. Leave some of the dough hanging over each side. Brush with butter. Repeat, this time covering the other side of the layers. Place another sheet lengthwise and brush with butter. Repeat, but do not brush the last sheet with butter. Sprinkle the walnuts in a 8-inch round in the center of the dough. Spoon the pears over the nuts. Loosely fold the filo up and over the pears. The dough will not fully cover the filling, there will be a space in the center where the pears show through. There will be points of dough sticking up like a pocket-handkerchief. Bake for 25 to 27 minutes, or until the filo is golden and the pears are tender. Carefully slide the tart off the pan onto the serving plate. If necessary, gently push the tart with a flat spatula.

Put the ribs meat-side down on a cutting board. Starting at one end, slip a paring knife under the membrane that covers the back of the rack. Loosen the membrane with the knife, then pull it off. Coat the ribs on both sides with the marinade; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Make the rub: Mix the brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, celery seeds, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl. Soak 2 cups hickory wood chips in water, 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat a grill to medium low (275 degrees F) and prepare for indirect grilling: For a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side; for a gas grill, turn off the burners on one side. Cover the grate on the cooler side of the grill with foil. Drain the wood chips. For a charcoal grill, scatter the chips over the hot coals; for a gas grill, put the chips in a smoker box and place over direct heat. Close the lid and allow smoke to build up, about 10 minutes. Rinse the marinade off the ribs and pat dry with paper towels. Work the spice rub into both sides of each rack with your hands. Place the ribs, meat-side up, on the foil over indirect heat. Close the lid and cook, undisturbed, until the meat shrinks back slightly to expose a bit of the bone, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Rotate the ribs (keep them meat-side up and over indirect heat), then close the lid and continue cooking, 2 hours to 2 hours, 30 minutes. (For a charcoal grill, add more hot coals as needed to maintain the temperature.) Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste and chili powder until incorporated, about 1 minute. Whisk in the vinegar, 1/4 cup water, the molasses, Worcestershire sauce, honey, mustard powder, espresso powder, 3/4 teaspoon black pepper and the cayenne. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, 5 minutes. Whisk in the ketchup and pineapple preserves. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened, about 45 minutes. Whisk in the liquid smoke. Let the sauce cool to room temperature, then remove the garlic. (The sauce will keep, refrigerated, up to 2 weeks.) Baste the ribs generously with the prepared barbecue sauce. Close the lid and continue cooking until glazed, about 20 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest a few minutes before cutting into individual ribs. Serve with more sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 73499,&quot;Steamed Cranberry Pudding (Adapted from Gourmet&#39;s Best Desserts) Butter and flour for lining the baking pan 3 3/4 cups fresh cranberries 1/2 cup ground, blanched almonds 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons orange zest 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon allspice 3 cups fine bread crumbs 1 1/2 sticks butter, melted and cooled 2/3 cup milk 3 large eggs, beaten lightly 1 tablespoon double acting baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup sugar 1 cup cranberry juice 1 cup sugar Pinch of salt 1 cup cranberries Instructions: Butter a 2-quart steamed pudding mold and line it with wax paper and then butter and flour the paper. In a food processor coarsely chop cranberries. Transfer to a bowl and add almonds, sugar, flour, orange zest, ginger, cinnamon and allspice and combine. In another bowl mix bread crumbs, melted butter, milk, eggs, baking powder, sugar and salt. Combine the bread crumb mixture with the cranberry mixture. Spoon the batter into the prepared mold, a little at a time, tapping the mold as it is filled to eliminate any air bubbles. Cover the mold tightly with a lid and tie with a towel wrung out in cold water and floured. Tie a knot at the top of the towel to facilitate removal of the mold from the kettle. Set a rack in the bottom of a kettle and add enough simmering water to reach 3 inches up the sides of the mold. Transfer the mold to the kettle. Keep the water at a brisk but not a rolling boil on the stove top. Cover the kettle with a lid. Steam the pudding for 2 hours, checking occasionally to make certain the water remains at a boil, adding more water throughout the cooking process as necessary. To test for doneness, insert a skewer in the center of the pudding. It should come out with crumbs adhering to it. Return the lid to the mold and transfer it to a rack. The pudding will stay warm in the mold, covered, for several hours. To make the glaze combine cranberry juice, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Simmer the juice, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil and swirl gently until a candy thermometer reads 250 degrees. Add whole cranberries and remove the pan from the heat. Let the glaze cool and then chill it, covered, until ready to serve. To serve, unmold the pudding onto a serving plate and pour the cranberry glaze over it.

Cover with plastic wrap or clingfilm, then pop into the refrigerator for 30 minutes, or longer if you want the flavours to get a bit more intense. Meanwhile, blacken the peppers directly over the flame of your hob, in a hot dry griddle pan or under a hot grill. Turn them every so often and when they look almost ruined, pop them into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap or clingfilm and put to one side to steam for 5 minutes or so, this will help their skins to come off. To make the tzatziki: Coarsely grate the cucumber into a sieve set up over a bowl. Add a few good pinches of salt, then use your hands to squeeze out as much water as you can. Pour the water away, then tip the cucumber into the empty bowl and add the yoghurt. Pound the garlic in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of salt until you have a paste, and spoon that into the bowl with the cucumber. Add the dried mint and red wine vinegar and mix really well. Have a taste to make sure you&#39;ve got the balance right, then put aside. Preheat a griddle pan or grill on a high heat. Thread the skewers through the marinated pork pieces, leaving little spaces between them so that the heat cooks everything evenly. Cook the kebabs on the screaming hot griddle or grill for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally until done on all sides. Warm your flatbreads in the oven or in a hot dry pan while your kebabs are cooking. Just before your kebabs are ready, peel and deseed your blackened peppers, then tear them into strips and put them into a bowl. Roll up your mint leaves, finely slice them and add to the bowl along with the dill. Add a few splashes of red wine vinegar, a pinch or two of salt and pepper and a lug of extra-virgin olive oil. Toss and mix together, then have a taste to check the balance of flavours. Cut your lemon into wedges. Put a dollop of tzatziki and the meat from 1 skewer on each warmed flatbread. Top with some of the pepper mixture, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a good squeeze of lemon juice.

Gather driftwood from the beach and pile on top of the coals. Create a bonfire by burning the wood for 1 to 2 hours until the rocks are red hot. Rack off the ashes. Set 1 cinder block on each corner of the pit to form the base. Lay a barbecue grate (or a piece of steel) on top to make a table. Gather seaweed from the beach and place a thick layer on the metal. Place the potatoes and corn on the rack, then cover with a thin layer of seaweed. Mound the lobster tails, claws and kielbasa evenly on top, then cover with another thin layer of seaweed. Set the clams and flounder on top and cover with another layer of seaweed. Finally, set the oysters on top, then cover with a thick layer of seaweed. The juice from the seafood will drip down and flavor the corn and potatoes. Cover the entire bake with burlap or a tarp soaked in seawater. The tarp traps in the seaweed steam and bakes the food. Keep the tarp wet by pouring seawater over the top if needed. Cook until the clams open and the lobster is bright red, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]&quot; 73533,&quot;Mac and Jack Salad 1 pound macaroni elbows or cavatappi corkscrew shaped hollow pasta Salt 1 cup frozen corn, defrosted 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1 small red onion, chopped 4 ribs celery, chopped Black pepper 8-ounce brick Monterey pepper jack cheese, diced 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, eyeball it 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it 1 cup store bought tomatillo salsa (mild, green) or chipotle salsa (hot, smoky red) 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves or flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Bring water to a boil, salt it and add pasta.

Butter a 6-cup loaf pan and line it with parchment or waxed paper. In a small saucepan, bring the orange juice and saffron to a boil then turn the heat off immediately and let steep 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter. Add 1 cup of the sugar and mix. With the mixer running at low speed, add the eggs one at a time. Working in alternating batches, and mixing after each addition, add the dry ingredients and 1/4 cup of the saffron spiked orange juice, trying to use all the threads in the orange juice. Mix just until smooth. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until raised in the center and a tester inserted into the center comes out dry and almost clean (a few crumbs are OK), 65 to 75 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and the remaining saffron spiked orange juice (about 1/3 cup), until the sugar is dissolved. When the cake is done, let cool in the pan 15 minutes (it will still be warm). Run a knife around the sides of the pan. Set a wire rack on a sheet pan with sides (to catch the glaze) and turn the cake out onto the rack. Peel off the waxed paper. Using a turkey baster or pastry brush, spread glaze all over the top and sides of the cake and let soak in. Repeat until all the glaze is used up, including any glaze that has dripped through onto the sheet pan. Let cool at room temperature or, wrapped in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator. The cake will last up to a week, well-wrapped with plastic wrap. Make the Lemon Caramel Sauce: Pour the sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the walls of the pan, trying not to splash any sugar onto the walls. Do not stir; gently draw your finger twice through the center of the sugar, making a cross, to moisten it. Over high heat, bring to a full boil and cook without stirring until amber-colored caramel, about 10 to 15 minutes, swirling the mixture occasionally to even out the color. Add the lemon juice and vanilla and wait for the caramel to bubble and subside. Let the caramel cool.

Pour the grape gelee mixture over the exposed layer of foie gras and let set. Refrigerate. Slice into small squares using a hot knife. To shave the foie gras: Chill the end piece of the foie gras lobe very well and slice on a deli slicer very thin. It will curl up into small tubes. Set aside in the refrigerator. To make the grape gel: In a saucepan, bring the grape juice to a boil and reduce until concentrated and very flavorful, and reduced by about one-quarter. Season with vinegar and salt, to taste. Measure the liquid. For every 100 milliliter (3.4 ounces) of liquid, use 1 gram (scant 1/4 teaspoon) of agar. Add the agar to the liquid and bring to a boil while whisking. Let set up in cooler. Once it&#39;s set, blend the gelee until thick, adding grape juice to thin it, if needed. Adjust the seasoning. To sear the foie gras: Coat the foie gras with flour.

If you are unsure about doneness, cut into the center of the fillets; the fish should be opaque (you can cover up the cut with the sauce). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 73554,&quot;\\Jucy\\ Lucys 2 1/2 pounds 80% lean ground beef (such as chuck) 6 slices American cheese 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 onion, diced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Dill pickle slices, for serving 6 soft hamburger buns, split Instructions: Divide the meat into 12 loose balls, then form into 1/4-inch-thick patties. Fold 1 slice cheese into a small square; center it on a patty, leaving a 1/2-inch border of meat around the cheese. Top with another patty. Crimp the edges of the 2 patties together, sealing the cheese inside. Repeat with the remaining cheese and meat to make 6 cheese-stuffed patties. Warm the vegetable oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer the onion to a bowl and wipe out the skillet. Add the patties to the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and cook 7 to 8 minutes. Flip, then poke the middle of each patty with a toothpick to release steam; cook 7 more minutes for medium well. Put about 3 pickle slices on each bottom bun; top with the sauteed onion and a patty, then close with the top bun. Wait a few minutes before biting into the burger-the cheese is hot! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 73555,&quot;Hot Cross Buns 1 scant tablespoon or 1 (1/4-ounce) package active dry yeast 1/4 cup warm water (about 110 degrees) 1 1/2 cups warm milk (about 110 degrees) 1/3 cup soft unsalted butter 1/2 cup light brown or raw sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper 3 1/2 to 41/2 cups unbleached flour 1/2 cup currants 1/2 cup candied lemon peel or candied citron 2 tablespoons milk 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream Instructions: In a large bowl, stir yeast into water to soften. Add milk, butter, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, pepper, and 2 cups flour. Beat vigorously for two minutes. Add the currants and lemon peel and stir to combine. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl.Turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Put dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about one hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into 24 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and put into two well-seasoned 9 by 12-inch baking pans. Cover with a towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Just before baking, cut a cross into the top of each bun. Combine the milk and sugar for the glaze and brush lightly over the top of the buns.Bake for 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the buns reach 190 degrees. Immediately remove buns from pans and cool on a rack for about 10 minutes.In a glass measuring cup with a pouring lip, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar with lemon juice and enough heavy cream to reach the consistency of honey. Use to pour into the cross on the top of each bun. Bread Basket method follows. Bread Basket: To shape a basket of bread \\eggs\\ Divide the dough in half. Return 1/2 the dough to the rising bowl and cover with a towel until needed. Divide the other piece of dough into 6 pieces. Shape each piece into a 26-inch strand. Twist the strands together. Lightly grease the bottom of an oven-proof bowl or pan with no handles (I have a Pyrex bowl that measures about 8 inches across the top and is about 4 inches deep that works perfectly) and place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Loosely coil the twisted strands around the beginning with where the pan and bowl meet. Continue until you get to the center of the bowl bottom. If you have too much dough left, pinch it off to use when making the \\eggs.\\ Take the remaining dough and divide it evenly into golf-ball sized pieces. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet about 3 inches apart. Cover dough with a towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Just before baking, lightly brush breads with glaze. Sprinkle the basket with nonpareils if desired.Bake for 25 minutes, basket, and \\eggs\\ for 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the breads reach 190 degrees. Immediately remove breads from baking sheet and cool on a rack. To serve the bread basket and \\eggs: Once the bread has cooled, pour the icing glaze over the eggs --scrape up what runs off and use it again. Let the glaze set, about 15 minutes. Decorate the \\eggs\\ with decorator&#39;s icing. Allow time for the icing to set so they can be placed in the bread basket without smudging. Put dyed coconut (in a plastic bag, shake 3 cups shredded coconut with 2 or 3 tablespoons green food coloring until well coated -- spread coconut on waxed paper to dry for about 30 minutes) into the basket. If the top edge of your basket isn&#39;t pretty, you can use some of the icing glaze to paint the edge to hold coconut in place to hide the edge. Place the \\eggs\\ in the basket and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73556,&quot;Frozen S&#39;mores Lattes 4 teaspoons instant coffee 3 cups ice<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 1/4 cup Toasted Marshmallow Syrup, recipe follows Whipped cream, for serving<br> Chocolate syrup, for serving<br> Crumbled graham crackers, for serving<br> 2 jumbo marshmallows, toasted<br> 6 jumbo marshmallows 1 cup sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Dissolve the instant coffee in 1 tablespoon warm water; add to a high-powered blender.

Season with salt and bring the water to a boil. Cook just until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the uncovered pot off the heat. Let them sit until almost room temperature. (Cooling them in the warm pot will get rid of any excess water in the potatoes, and that&#39;s good.) Meanwhile, cut the white parts off the ends of the celery stalks. Cut the stalks in half lengthwise, then across into 1/4-inch slices. Stir the celery, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and the remaining ingredients together in a serving bowl large enough to hold all the potatoes. When they&#39;re cool, cut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces, add them to the bowl as you go. Stir gently until all the potatoes are coated with dressing. You can make the salad up to a couple of hours in advance. Keep covered at room temperature. Don&#39;t refrigerate or the potatoes will lose their rich, smooth texture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73558,&quot;Pavlova 1/2 cup egg whites, at room temperature (from about 4 eggs) 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon raspberry vinegar or red wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed 2 kiwi fruits, peeled and thinly sliced or 1 cup of another ripe fruit, such as peaches or nectarines 10 strawberries, green parts trimmed off, thinly sliced or other berries, such as raspberries or blackberries Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in a clean, dry bowl until foamy. Add the granulated sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, and vanilla and continue whipping until stiff, smooth and glossy, about 8 minutes more. On a sheet of parchment paper cut to fit a sheet pan, use a pencil to draw or trace a circle 9-inches in diameter. Line the sheet pan with the parchment, pencil side down (you should still be able to see the circle). Spoon the egg whites into the circle, using the back of the spoon to smooth the top and sides of the disk. Bake in the center of the oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 300 degrees and bake until the meringue has puffed up and cracked on the top and the surface is lightly browned to the color of cafe au lait, about 45 minutes more. Turn off the oven, prop the oven door open, and let the pavlova cool in the oven at least 30 minutes, to room temperature. This ensures a gradual cooling, which protects the delicate meringue. Whip the cream and brown sugar together until stiff. Spoon it in the center of the cooled pavlova and spread out to within 1/2-inch of the edge. Arrange the slices of kiwi around the edge. Arrange the slices of strawberry in the middle. To serve, slice into wedges with a serrated knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73559,&quot;Greek Meatball Stew 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 14-ounce cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes with green chiles 1 large red onion, cut into chunks 1 cup pimento-stuffed green olives 1 cup lightly packed fresh mint, dill or a combination 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground pumpkin pie spice or allspice 2 thick slices sandwich bread, torn into pieces 12 ounces ground beef chuck 1 14-ounce can butter beans, drained and rinsed 1 large or 2 small zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch pieces Juice of 1 lemon Instructions: Put the chicken broth and tomatoes in a large Dutch oven or pot, cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix. Drizzle in 1 tablespoons of the olive oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. *Alternatively if you don&#39;t have an electric mixer: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Continue as directed above. Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it.). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed. Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tins of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest. Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they&#39;ll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 73568,&quot;No-Fry Sheet-Pan Eggplant Parmesan 4 tablespoons olive oil 2 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes Kosher salt 1/3 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped, plus more torn leaves for serving 1 medium-large eggplant (about 1 1/2 pounds), sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 2 eggs, beaten 3/4 cup Italian-style breadcrumbs 1 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put 2 tablespoons olive oil and the garlic in a large skillet and place over medium heat. When the garlic sizzles and its edges start to brown, add the tomatoes, red pepper flakes and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped basil. Heat an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan in the oven for at least 10 minutes while you bread the eggplant. Line up 3 shallow dishes; fill one with the flour, one with the beaten eggs, and one with the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle both sides of the eggplant slices with salt. Dredge an eggplant slice in the flour (tapping off excess), then dip in the egg, and finally dredge it in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with the remaining eggplant. When all the eggplant slices are breaded, carefully remove the heated sheet pan from the oven and brush it with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place the eggplant on the sheet pan in a single layer. Bake until the undersides are crisp and browned, 8 to 10 minutes, then flip the slices and continue baking until they are golden on the second side, 8 to 10 minutes more.<br> Top the baked eggplant with the tomato sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan. Return the pan to the oven and bake, rotating halfway through, until the cheese melts and browns and the sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Top with torn basil before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 73569,&quot;Orecchiette with Butternut Squash and Sausage Kosher salt 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 2 Italian sausages (preferably hot), removed from the casings and crumbled (about 6 ounces) 1 pound butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh oregano 10 ounces orecchiette 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese Red pepper flakes and/or fresh basil, for topping Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

For the icing: Put the softened vegan butter into a large bowl, then gradually beat in the confectioners\\u2019 sugar using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk. Add the plant-based milk and vanilla extract and whisk until light and fluffy. When the ice cream has frozen hard again, remove the cake from the freezer and turn it over onto a plate. Remove the tin and peel away the parchment. Spread the icing all over the cake. (You can put it back into the freezer at this point until ready to serve; it will keep, wrapped well, up to 1 month). When ready to serve, decorate with sprinkles and transfer to a cake stand. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 73575,&quot;Parmesan Herbed Orzo 2 1/2 cups orzo 1 clove garlic, minced 1/4 cup chopped red onion 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley leaves 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cook orzo as directed on package.

It will absorb some of the water and puff up a little bit. To roast the red peppers: Place the red bell peppers directly onto the fire on your gas stove. Or place directly onto your electric burner. Char well for over 15 minutes on all sides. You are looking for a very black exterior. Pop the peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap to seal in the heat and sweat. In 10 minutes you can peel off the charred skin. If you want you can do this under running cold water, which makes it a little easier. Cut in wide slices and set aside. Peel and finely dice the onion. Slice the sausage into 1/2-inch pieces. To fabricate the Cornish game hen: Remove the carcass from your hen beginning at top of bird along either side of breast bone. Using a sharp knife, work your way down each side of carcass trying to remove as much meat from the bone as possible, to make 2 halves. Leave in the leg and wing bones, but discard the carcass (or save for stock). Then cut the leg and wing pieces off from the breast pieces. To clean the shrimp: Start by holding the shrimp, backside up, and run your knife down the length of its spine. This will expose the vein. To remove the vein you can use your finger, or the tip of your knife to pull it out of the shrimp. To clean the mussels: Scrub the mussels removing any sand and seaweed bits. If mussels are open, test them by pressing the two shells together. If they start to close, then they are still alive and safe to use. If not, discard them. To clean the squid: Grab the head, while holding the end and PULL. Most of the guts will come out in one neat pile. You need to remove the transparent spine (or quill) by running a finger along the inside of the mantle holding it by the tip and pulling. Check the base in case there is a bit of spine left and that can be removed as well. Remove the wings by pulling off and then peel the rest of the skin off, which should come off in one piece. Slice the squid body open, score it on the diagonal (making a shallow incision but not cutting all the way through). Then cut this squid piece into flat triangles, or if you prefer simply cut the squid body into rings. In a large skillet turn a large pan on high heat and drizzle in the oil. Add the hen pieces to the hot pan and sear and brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Take the pieces out of the pan and set aside. Add the chorizo or other sausage to the pan. Stir until browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Leave there. In the same pan, continue to build the dish by adding the onions, and saute until golden. Add the turmeric, and smoked paprika, and then add the garlic. Add the wild rice, and stir to coat with all the flavors and allow the grains to toast slightly. Return the seared hen pieces to the pan. Add your warm chicken stock to which you have added the saffron. Reserve about a cup of stock for later. Cover the pan with a lid or tin foil, and let cook, about 40 minutes. Finish by adding the seafood (shrimp, mussels, squid), and the last cup of stock just before the last 10 minutes. Just before serving, add the peas and the reserved roasted red peppers. Cover for a minute and the residual heat will warm both. Ladle up into two personal paella pans. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Pinot Noir]&quot; 73578,&quot;Shrimp and Andouille Gumbo 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced 1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced 2 large onions, diced 2 celery stalks, diced 3/4 cup vegetable oil or lard 3/4 cup flour 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 6 cloves garlic, minced 5 1/2 cups reserved shrimp stock, recipe follows 1 pound andouille sausage, cut in 1/2-inch pieces (half-moons) Peeled, deveined shrimp, reserved from making stock, below Plain cooked white rice, for serving 2 pounds medium shrimp, with shells 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 small onion, roughly chopped 1 carrot, roughly chopped 1 stalk celery, roughly chopped 1/2 cup white wine Water 3 black peppercorns 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves (or a couple fresh sprigs) Instructions: Combine peppers, onions, and celery in a bowl and have ready next to the stove. In a large heavy skillet (cast iron is best) heat oil until it just begins to smoke. Gradually add flour, whisking constantly. Continue whisking constantly and cook over medium to medium-high heat until roux is dark brown and very fragrant. Add vegetable mixture and stir with a wooden spoon, continuing to cook, for 2 minutes. Add salt and dry seasonings and garlic and stir to combine, cooking for another 1 to 2 minutes, then remove pan from heat. Place shrimp stock in a large Dutch oven or stockpot and bring to a gentle boil. Gradually add roux mixture to boiling stock, whisking constantly, until completely incorporated and dissolved. Return to a boil and add the andouille, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, then add shrimp and turn off heat. Let gumbo sit for 5 minutes to allow shrimp to cook, then serve immediately over a scoop of plain white rice. Note: You can do everything in this recipe up to the point of adding the shrimp beforehand; bring gumbo up to a boil before adding shrimp to serve. Cooking the roux can be tricky. For safety&#39;s sake, wear good oven mitts while whisking (roux can cook to nearly 400 degrees F!) and be very careful not to let it burn on the bottom. If black bits show up in the roux before it is done, you must start over, boo-hoo. If the roux starts to smoke, remove it from the heat for a few minutes and keep whisking?remember that the pan will retain a lot of heat that will continue to cook the roux even off the flame. This is not a quick project! Your patience will be rewarded with a rich, delicious gumbo. Peel and de-vein the shrimp and reserve the shells. Refrigerate the shrimp until needed. In a saucepan or stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Then, add the shrimp shells and cook, stirring constantly, until shells are pink and fragrant. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half. Add water to the pot to just past the level of the shrimp shells and add peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring to a boil and immediately reduce to a simmer. Skim impurities (i.e., scum) from top of stock and simmer for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Strain stock and reserve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 73579,&quot;Texas Rising Chili Con Carne 3 dried ancho chiles 1 dried cl d&#39;arbol<br> 1 dried New Mexico or pasilla cl 1 tablespoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano<br> 6 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into lardons or 1/4-inch strips<br> 4 pounds trimmed chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 medium onion, diced<br> 4 jalapenos, ribs and seeds removed, diced<br> 4 jalapenos, ribs and seeds removed, diced 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 4 cups beef stock, hot, plus more if needed One 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 2 tablespoons cornmeal Juice of 2 limes<br> Perry County Corn Bread, recipe follows, for serving Suggested toppings: crispy bacon, French-fried onions, crushed tortilla chips, sliced avocados and corn nuts<br> Suggested toppings: crispy bacon, French-fried onions, crushed tortilla chips, sliced avocados and corn nuts 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter 2 cups self-rising cornmeal<br> 1/4 cup self-rising flour<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup buttermilk, plus more if needed 2 eggs<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Soak slices in water for 10 minutes. Drain and dry completely in a salad spinner. Meanwhile, pour enough olive oil into a large saucepan so it&#39;s about an inch deep. Heat over medium heat until a slice of onion bubbles gently when placed in the oil, about 310 degrees F. Add the onions and fry, stirring occasionally until just golden, about 8 minutes. Scoop the onions from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper-towel lined baking sheet.<br> Add about half of the potatoes, and fry until lightly golden and a little puffy, about 10 minutes. Scoop the potatoes from the oil, add to the onions. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes. Reserve the oil. Season the vegetables with 3 teaspoons of the salt. (The preparation of the vegetables can be done up to 2 hours ahead.)<br> Break the eggs into a large bowl. Whisk just enough to combine but not so much that they get loose and runny, about 15 times. Add the vegetables and remaining 1 teaspoon salt.<br> Heat a medium (10-inch) nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil and heat. Add the tortilla mixture and stir briskly with a spatula to get peaks and valleys in the folds of the egg, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stop stirring and reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the eggs are set but still pretty loose, about 5 minutes. Lay a flat pan lid or a plate on top and invert the tortilla. Add more oil to the pan if needed, and slide the tortilla back into the pan, cover and finish cooking until set and lightly brown, about 3 minutes more. Slide the tortilla out of the pan to a cutting board to cool slightly.<br> Cut into cubes or thin wedges and serve warm or room temperature as is or with 1 of the suggested toppings.<br> Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and sugar and half the salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and sweet, about 1 hour. If the onions begin to get really brown, add a splash of water to slow them down.<br> Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes, crosswise. Grate them on the cut side on the largest holes of a box grater into a bowl all the way down to the skins. Discard skins. Add tomato puree, pimenton and bay leaf to the caramelized onions, and continue to cook until quite thick and the tomato separates from the oil, about 10 to 15 minutes more. Season with the remaining salt or to taste. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 73581,&quot;Lobster and Fennel Napoleon with Herbed Lobster Cream 4 (1-pound) lobsters, cut in half lengthwise, tails and claws removed 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 shallots, roughly chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 4 small fennel bulbs cut top to bottom into 1/2-inch slices, save the pieces that arent perfect slices 1 cup dry vermouth 1 quart (32-ounces) heavy cream 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 eggs 5 cups panko bread crumbs Kosher salt Canola oil, for frying Olive oil, for grilling Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the lobster claws in water for 3 minutes. Dont cook them through, but enough to be easily removed from the shell. Remove the claws from the water. Add the tails to the water and cook for 3 minutes. Extract the meat from the claws and the tails and set aside. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the shallots, garlic and any scraps from the sliced fennel, saute until slightly brown. Add the lobster bodies, the cracked shells from the tails and the claws, saute another 5 minutes. Add a few good pinches of kosher salt and stir. Deglaze with vermouth and simmer until the alcohol is mostly cooked down. Add the heavy cream, turn the heat to low. Let simmer for about 30 minutes. Strain, add tarragon and pepper. Dice the par-cooked lobster tail, and add to the cream mixture. While the cream is simmering, crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk. Add the sliced fennel and coat well. Pour the bread crumbs onto a plate. Dip each fennel slice in the panko, pressing firmly to coat completely on both sides. Lay the coated fennel slices on a plate. In a large saute pan, heat 1/2 cup of canola oil over medium heat. Fry the breaded fennel one piece at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. When golden brown on one side, flip and cook the other side to the same golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Drain the fennel on paper towel and season with salt. The next step works better with a grill, but if this isnt an option, a saute pan works well. Preheat a grill. Coat the par-cooked claws with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place the claw meat on a very hot grill, cook about 2 minutes per side, and remove from the heat. To construct a plate, lay down one slice of fennel, then place one claw on top. Layer another slice of fennel and another claw on top. Spoon the cream liberally over the top, making sure each plate gets a nice amount of tail meat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 73582,&quot;Double-Dipped Chicken Parmesan 4 large eggs Salt and freshly ground black pepper About 3 cups good quality bread crumbs, seasoned or plain 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved 1/4 cup olive oil 7 cups tomato sauce, store bought 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1/3 cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, optional, for garnish Accompaniments: Cooked linguine and Sauteed broccoli rabe, recipes follow 1 pound linguine 2 tablespoons olive oil Red pepper flakes, to taste 2 cloves garlic, sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 pounds broccoli rabe (about 2 bunches) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the eggs in a bowl and whisk with salt and pepper.

Line a baking sheet with foil and pour about 2 tablespoons olive oil evenly over the pan. Sprinkle the oil with salt and pepper. Strew a little of the garlic, basil, thyme, and bay leaves over the oil. Cut each tomato lengthwise in half and carefully, with your fingers or a tiny spoon, remove the seeds. Lay the tomato halves cut side down in the pan, wiggling the tomatoes around if necessary so that each tomato has a floss of oil on its cut side. Using a pastry brush, give the tops of the tomatoes a light coat of olive oil. Season the tops of the tomatoes with salt and pepper and a little sugar, and scatter over the rest of the garlic, basil, thyme, and bay leaves. Slide the pan into the oven and bake the tomatoes for 2 1/2 hours, or until they are very tender but still able to hold their shape; turn the tomatoes over at half-time and open the oven for just a second every 30 minutes or so to get rid of the moisture that will build up in the oven. Cool the tomatoes to room temperature on their pan. When the tomatoes are cool, transfer them to a jar, stacking them neatly. Pour whatever oil remains in the pan over the tomatoes and then, if you plan to keep the tomatoes longer than 1 or 2 days, pour in enough olive oil to cover and refrigerate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73593,&quot;Blueberry Bran Muffins 1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing the pan 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 7 ounces Greek yogurt 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup honey 2 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups wheat bran 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries (8 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Some fish grill better than others, if you&#39;re unsure, ask your butcher. Excellent selections are salmon, bass, halibut, mahimahi, yellowtail, and lingcod. Heat the grill on high. Combine the butter and olive oil in a bowl and set aside. Combine the pineapple, jalapeno, and honey. Brush a mix of melted butter and olive oil onto the fillet or fish steak before placing it in the grill. This will cause the flames to rise up, searing in the juices. Brush more of this mixture on the top as it&#39;s cooking. Do not overcook, most fish grill quickly. You must adjust the cooking time based on the thickness of the fish being cooked. Flip the fillets or steaks and reapply another brushing of the butter/oil mixture. Once seared, reduce the flame to low and close the lid on the barbecue. Wait a few minutes (until fish is nearly done) and pour the pineapple mixture or Jazz Honey-Jalapeno Pineapple Sauce over the top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is cooked. Garnish platter with green leaf lettuce, carefully place fish on the bed of lettuce, and serve. This is a simple and amazingly eye attractive dish.

Peel, and while still warm, pass through a food mill. In a small saute pan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until soft. In a medium bowl, combine all the cheeses, the herbs, and the beaten egg. Add the cooked shallots and garlic and the warm potato. Stir until blended (being careful not to overmix, or the mixture will get pasty). Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Then, with lightly moistened hands, roll into 1/2 ounce balls, about the size of golf balls. Cut the pasta dough into 4 portions and work with 1 portion at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with plastic wrap. Lightly dust the work surface with flour. With a pasta machine or a rolling pin, roll out the dough about 20 inches long and 4 inches wide. Brush the dough with egg wash and arrange 9 to 10 balls of filling on the lower third of the length of the dough, about 1 to 1 = inches apart. Fold the top half over to cover the balls. Press the dough around each ball to seal, making sure that you do not have any air pockets. With a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut the ravioli. Dust a tray with flour and arrange the ravioli on the tray, dusting with more flour. Repeat with the remaining dough, egg wash, and filling. Refrigerate, covered, until needed. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, over high heat, add the oil and the butter. Cook the butter until it begins to brown. Drain the ravioli and toss into the browned butter, turning to coat both sides. Add the Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and hazelnuts and serve immediately. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the water. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine and pinch the dough to test it. If it&#39;s too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out on a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed. Loosely wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out 1 piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness. If using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening. Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers. If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour. Run the pasta through the machine. Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again. Repeat this procedure 2 or more times, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers. Continue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary. (The strip of dough will be long. If you don&#39;t have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered). Adjust the cutting mechanism to the desired width, cut the noodles, and allow them to dry before cooking. A convenient way to dry pasta is to arrange the cut pasta on a pastry tray sprinkled with flour, preferably semolina flour. As 1 layer is completed, sprinkle flour over the noodles, place a piece of parchment paper over them, and continue layering with noodles and flour. Dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 73608,&quot;La Perla 1 1/2 ounces reposado tequila 1 1/2 ounces manzanilla sherry 3/4 ounce pear liqueur Lemon twist, for garnish Instructions: Combine all the ingredients except the garnish in a mixing glass half-filled with ice.

Divide into 8 equal portions. Take 1 portion in the cup of your hand. Wrap and shape the meat around a skewer to form a 5-inch log of even thickness, centered on the skewer. Repeat with the remaining 7 portions of meat. Refrigerate the kebabs to let them firm up a little, about 15 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl, and cover tightly with plastic wrap; make a small slit in the center with the tip of a paring knife to vent excess steam. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) until the potatoes are cooked through, about 7 minutes in a 1,100-watt oven. Let the potatoes cool for a few minutes, then toss with the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Thread them, cut-sides facing out, on the remaining 4 skewers; reserve the bowl.<br> Cook the potatoes on the grill until you see grill marks and charring in places, about 2 minutes per side. Slide the potatoes off the skewers back into the bowl. Toss with the remaining lemon juice and the scallions. Add more oil if the potatoes look too dry.<br> Brush the 8 kebab skewers with oil, and place them on the grill. Cook for 2 minutes on one side, then flip. Brush some of the ketchup glaze on the grilled side. After 2 minutes, flip the skewers again. Continue brushing and flipping every minute or so until the meat is no longer pink inside and is cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes total. Divide the skewers and potato salad among 4 plates, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 73613,&quot;Grilled Oysters with Lemon Garlic Butter 10 tablespoons softened unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 2 tablespoons minced parsley leaves 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 teaspoon minced fresh chives 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, optional 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 24 shucked oysters, half of each shell reserved and washed Instructions: In a bowl combine all ingredients except the oysters and mix thoroughly to combine.

Add the butter and vegetable shortening. Work the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Add the white vinegar, egg and 5 tablespoons cold water and stir until just combined. Form 2 equal-sized balls. Place each in a large plastic bag (do not seal) and slightly flatten with a rolling pin; this makes it much easier to roll out the crust later. After flattening, seal the bag tightly. Place in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to chill. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove 1 bag of dough from the freezer (save the other dough for another use), remove the dough from the bag and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough starting at the center and working outward. Be gentle and patient; it&#39;ll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out. If you think the bottom is really sticking to the surface below while rolling, use a metal spatula to loosen it. When fully rolled out, loosen again with a spatula and lift the pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan (or you can roll the pastry over the rolling pin, lift it onto the pie pan and unroll it). Gently press the dough against the corner of the pan and tear off any excess dough. Then tuck under the edges and go around the pie pan pinching the dough to crimp the edge. For the pie filling: In a bowl, mix the apples, lemon juice, granulated sugar, flour and salt. Set aside. For the crumb topping: Cut the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter, then add in the brown sugar, oats and salt. Add the apples to the prepared pie shell and top with the crumb topping. Bake for 1 hour, covering the edge of the crust with foil if it starts to brown too quickly. After an hour, sprinkle the chopped pecans over the pie, then bake for a further 5 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and pour 1/2 jar (or more, if you&#39;re feeling dangerous and naughty) of caramel topping over the top. Allow to cool slightly before serving \\u2014 or don&#39;t if you can&#39;t wait! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 73619,&quot;Chutney Chicken 12 pieces bone-in skin-on chicken, mix of chicken thighs, legs and quartered breast 2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil<br> Salt and pepper<br> 2 tablespoons butter<br> 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 1 1/2 inches ginger, grated<br> 4 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 2 chiles such as red finger, Fresno or jalapeno, seeded and chopped<br> 1 1/2 cups chicken stock<br> 1 cup mango chutney, such as Patek&#39;s or Major Grey&#39;s<br> One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes or petite diced tomatoes<br> 1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut<br> 1 1/2 cups brown or white long-grain rice 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted<br> 1 lime, juiced<br> 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced on an angle<br> Chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, for garnish<br> Instructions: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.

Cut off the top 1/3 of the lemon and reserve to cap the cups. Carefully hollow out each lemon with a teaspoon, turning and digging into the pith so the entire inside of the fruit comes out, take care to leave the lemon shell in tact. Chop and mash the lemon pulp and strain into a blender. (You should have about 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, reserve it for the filling.) Freeze the lemon cups in egg cartons, with their lids, at least 1 hour or up to overnight. The frozen shell will prevent the lemon ice from melting too quickly when you serve it. To make the ginger syrup: Combine the sugar, water, and ginger in a pot over medium heat. Gently simmer and stir for 2 minutes until the sugar is dissolved and the ginger fragrant ? do not allow the syrup to boil or get dark. Remove from heat, cover, and steep until cool.

Brush top of pastry with egg yolk and milk mixture. Bake pies in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until crust is golden. Serve either hot or cold with pickles or relish. Tip: Meat pies may be made ahead and refrigerated. Unbaked pies may be refrigerated for 24 hours, or frozen. Thaw in refrigerator before baking. For Pastry: In a bowl, mix 2 cups sifted, all-purpose flour with 1/4 teaspoon salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in 3/4 cup chilled, cubed shortening or lard until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Measure 1/4 to 1/3 cup ice water. Sprinkle over mixture, a spoonful at a time, stirring with a fork, adding just enough water so dough holds together. Shape into a ball, press into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. Leftover pastry can be frozen for later use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73662,&quot;Big Cheese Squeeze 2 slices of bread, cut thin (as far as bread selection goes, all I&#39;ll say is the bigger the loaf the bigger the sandwich) 1 teaspoon (or more) smooth Dijon mustard 1 cup grated cheese Good quality olive oil for spritzing. Instructions: Find 2 heavy skillets that will nest together. Two (10-inch) cast iron skillets are ideal. Heat them over high heat. Meanwhile, spread mustard on one slice of bread. Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread.<br> Spritz the bread surface that&#39;s staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer. A light coat will do, don&#39;t soak. When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down in the middle of one pan. (if your pans are a different size, this would be the larger one.) Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet. Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich. If the top pan isn&#39;t cast iron, weigh it down with a brick, can, or something of similar heft. Wait patiently, crack a beer. When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it&#39;s done. This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes.<br> Carefully remove the top skillet, (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it). Just look at it. It&#39;s perfect...better than mom&#39;s (no reason to tell her.)<br> Remove to a plate, count to 10 and slice it in half. Take a bite. Take another. So they lost ... there&#39;s always next year. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 73663,&quot;Multigrain Stuffing With Nuts and Dried Fruit 9 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish 2 medium onions, diced 2 medium firm cooking apples (such as Cortland), chopped 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup slivered almonds 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped 1/4 cup sunflower seeds 1/4 cup dried blueberries 1/4 cup dried cranberries 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth 2 large eggs 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 16 cups stale multigrain bread cubes Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and butter a 3-quart baking dish. Melt 8 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, apples and thyme, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft, about 3 minutes. Add the almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, dried blueberries and dried cranberries. Add the broth and bring to a simmer. Whisk the eggs and parsley in a large bowl. Add the bread, then pour in the broth mixture and toss. Transfer the stuffing to the prepared baking dish and dot with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes, then uncover and bake until golden, about 30 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Gris, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 73664,&quot;Key Lime Pie Cheesecake Bars Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking pan 18 whole graham crackers<br> 1 stick salted butter, melted<br> Three 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 1/2 cup bottled lime juice<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 4 large eggs<br> Powdered sugar, for topping<br> Grated lime zest, for topping<br> Instructions: For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place a 9-by-13-inch baking pan of hot water on the bottom oven rack. Line a second 9-by-13-inch baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang around the edges, and coat with cooking spray. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Pour in the butter and pulse until the crumbs are well coated and stick together when pinched. Press evenly into the bottom of the foil-lined pan. For the filling: Add the cream cheese, granulated sugar, sour cream, lime juice, vanilla and eggs to the food processor (no need to clean it first). Process until smooth, using a spatula to scrape the sides as needed. Pour the filling over the crust and smooth the surface. Bake on the center rack until the center is just set but slightly jiggly, about 45 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the pan in the oven with the door closed for 10 minutes. Open the door halfway and leave the pan in the oven until the cheesecake is firmly set around the edges and very slightly jiggly in the center, about 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes, then refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, lift the cheesecake out of the pan using the foil overhang. Cut into 12 large pieces (or 24 small pieces if preferred) and place on a serving platter. Generously dust with powdered sugar and grate over lime zest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73665,&quot;Roasted Red Snapper with Rosemary 4 tablespoons olive oil 1 whole (3-pound) red snapper, cleaned, scaled Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon, halved 1/2 small onion, chopped 1/2 small fennel bulb, chopped 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon chopped fennel fronds 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1 small garlic clove, minced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a heavy large baking sheet with foil. Oil the foil and fish with 1 tablespoon of oil. Place the fish atop the foil. Sprinkle the fish cavity with salt and pepper. Squeeze 1/2 of the lemon inside the fish cavity. Fill the cavity with the onion, fennel and rosemary sprigs. Bake until the fish is just cooked through at the bone, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, squeeze the remaining lemon 1/2 into a small bowl. Whisk in the fennel fronds, rosemary, and garlic. Gradually whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil. Season the lemon sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper. Using a sharp knife, separate the 2 fillets from the backbone. Using a metal spatula, transfer the top fillets to a plate. Lift the fish backbone from the bottom fillets (the backbone and head should come off together easily), and discard. Using the spatula, transfer the remaining fillets to plates. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper. Drizzle the lemon sauce over the fish and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 73666,&quot;Ancho cl Chips 3 cups peanut oil 4 large potatoes, gaufrette cut 1/2 cup ancho cl powder Salt Instructions: Heat oil to 375 degrees F.

Immediately toss with ancho powder and salt. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 73667,&quot;Halloween Party Pizzas One 12-ounce package multigrain sandwich thins 1 cup pizza sauce 3 mozzarella string cheese sticks One 2.25-ounce can sliced black olives, drained 3 deli slices Cheddar 9 pepperoni slices 3 slices provolone 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella One 2.25-ounce can whole pitted black olives, drained Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Split the sandwich thins into 2 halves and place 6 on each of 2 baking sheets. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons pizza sauce over each sandwich thin, spreading it to the edges. Add the toppings to create each of the monsters. For mummies: Tear the string cheese into thin strips. Arrange the strips horizontally across three pizzas like layers of a mummy. Nestle in two olive slices for eyes. For jack-o&#39;-lanterns: Cut out rounds from the Cheddar slices with a jar lid or 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter. Place the cut rounds on 3 pizzas. Trim pepperoni slices into triangles (3 per pizza; 2 for the eyes and 1 for the nose) and place on the Cheddar rounds. Cut an olive slice in half and use for a smile. For ghosts: Trim the provolone slices along a bottom edge in a zig-zag pattern with kitchen shears. Place 2 black olive slices on each pizza to create the eyes. For spiders: Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons shredded mozzarella over 3 pizzas. While the pizza is baking, cut 2 whole black olives in half for the bodies and cut the remaining olive slices in half for the legs. Assemble the spiders on the cheese once the pizzas come out of the oven and are still hot by inverting an olive half on each for a body, then arranging the legs around the bodies. Bake all the pizzas until the cheese begins to melt, but before it bubbles, 8 to 10 minutes. (Browning or bubbling may ruin your shapes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 73668,&quot;Salt and Herb Roasted Whole Fish 2 lemons, 1 zested and juiced and 1 sliced into thin rounds 1 bunch fresh thyme, half picked and half left whole 4 fresh bay leaves, coarsely snipped using scissors 3 cloves garlic, smashed 9 egg whites 8 cups kosher salt Two 1-pound whole fish, such as branzino or orate, fins and gills removed High-quality olive oil, for finishing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a food processor, combine the lemon zest and juice, the picked thyme, bay leaves and garlic and pulse until it becomes a coarse paste. Add the egg whites and puree until very frothy and foamy. In a large bowl combine the herb-egg white mixture with the salt and mix until it becomes a moist paste. Place half of the lemon slices and whole thyme in the cavity of each of the fish. On a baking sheet, place a little less than half of the salt mixture in two rows. Lay the fish on top of each row. Pack the remaining salt mixture around the fish to completely encase them, pressing the mixture firmly on the fish to create a crust. Roast the fish for 25 minutes. Remove and let rest for 10 minutes. Crack open the salt crust and brush the excess salt from the fish. Remove the top fillet, pull the spine out and remove the bottom fillet. Drizzle with olive oil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 73669,&quot;Rolfs Original Swiss Cheese Fondue 1/2 pound Emmentaller cheese, grated 1/2 pound Le Gruyere cheese, grated 1 clove garlic 2 cups dry white wine 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 teaspoon water Freshly ground black pepper 1 loaf Italian or French bread, cut into 1-inch cubes with crust on one side Instructions: In a bowl, combine the cheeses and put aside. Rub the inside of a large saucepan or casserole dish, with garlic and place the saucepan on low-medium heat. Add the wine, heat until warm, but not boiling!<br> Add the cheese by handfuls, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until melted and cheese-wine mixture has the consistency of a creamy sauce. Mix the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and then stir into the cheese. As the mixture thickens, let the mixture come to a boil once, before you remove the fondue pot and place it on a lighted burner on a table. Adjust flame of the burner so the fondue continues bubbling lightly.<br> Place baskets of bread cubes onto the table. Take a handful of the bread cubes, sprinkle with black pepper and spear fondue fork through bread cubes. Dunk and stir well to bottom of pot.<br> Serve with white wine or Kirsch to prevent getting that heavy cheese feeling!<br> Other serving suggestions: cherry tomatoes, grapes, sliced ham and kielbasa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 73670,&quot;Torta Caprese 1 1/2 cups (63%) bittersweet chocolate chips 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan<br> 5 large eggs, separated<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 cups almond flour<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting<br> Instructions: Place the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler and melt until smooth. Cool slightly, until just warm to the touch. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the inside of a 9-inch springform pan. Place the egg whites in a medium bowl with the salt. Place the yolks in a slightly larger bowl with the granulated sugar. Using a handheld mixer, beat the whites on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Then beat the egg yolks on medium speed until light, pale and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, stir the chocolate mixture, almond flour and vanilla into the yolks. In 2 batches, fold the whipped whites into the chocolate base. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake until puffed and beginning to crack on top, about 40 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack. When cool, run a thin knife around the edge of the pan to release the cake. Remove the outside ring and dust the top with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 73671,&quot;Hash Browns Makeover 2 medium Yukon gold potatoes (about 10 ounces), scrubbed 1 large parsnip, (about 5 ounces) 2 scallions (white and green), chopped 2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Grate the potatoes, with their skin into a large bowl. Peel and grate the parsnip; add to the potatoes. Toss the vegetables with the scallions, parsley and season with the salt and pepper, to taste. Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over medium heat and brush the skillet with about half the oil. Add the potato mixture and form into an even cake by pressing lightly with a spatula. Cook, shaking the pan periodically to prevent sticking, until the hash browns are crisp and brown, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat; place a flat plate over the top of the skillet. Carefully flip the pan so the potato cake goes onto the plate. Brush the skillet with the remaining olive oil and then side the hash browns back into the skillet. Cook until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes more. Slide out of the skillet onto a heated serving plate. Cut into wedges to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73672,&quot;Steamed Soy-Marinated Chicken 1 cup low-sodium soy sauce 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon peanut oil 1/2 lime, juiced 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, sliced thick 1 cloves garlic, sliced 1 handful cilantro, chopped 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1 head savoy cabbage Instructions: Into a large, re-sealable plastic bag add the soy sauce, sesame oil, peanut oil, lime juice, ginger, garlic, and cilantro. Seal the bag and shake it to mix the ingredients. Add the chicken breasts and shake it again. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1/2 hour or up to overnight. Pour about 1-inch of water into a wok and bring it to a boil over high heat. Line the bottom of a bamboo steamer with a layer of cabbage leaves. Place the marinated chicken on top of the leaves. Cover the steamer and put it into the wok.

Mix the ground beef, heavy cream, Worcestershire and the salt and some pepper in a bowl. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients. Form 1/4 cup of the meat mixture into patties, making 16 patties total. Make an indentation with your thumb to keep the patties from plumping too much when they cook. Grill the sliders until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and pile on a platter. Toast the halved buns on the grill. Place the sliders between the buns and serve immediately. Fry the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until slightly crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and cut into bite-size pieces. In a separate pan, cook the onions in the butter over a low heat until caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use a fork to crumble the gorgonzola. Put the bacon, caramelized onions and crumbled gorgonzola into separate bowls. Serve as delicious toppings for both sliders and macaroni cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 73675,&quot;Garlic Mashed Potatoes 1 russet potato 1 tablespoon butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Instructions: In a medium sized pot, cover the potato with cold water.

Using a paring knife, cut a wedge out of each eggplant, from stem to base, just large enough to stick a spoon inside and scoop out the flesh inside. Discard the flesh you scoop out. Coat a large saute pan with the oil and place over medium flame. Lightly fry the eggplants on all sides, until slightly charred and blistered; remove to a platter and set aside. Return the pan to the heat and add the shallots and garlic, saute for 5 minutes, until soft and golden brown. Add the ground lamb to the pan and brown the meat well, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Stir in the tomatoes, combine well, and let simmer for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Toss in a couple of handfuls of the parsley, the mint, and lemon juice; continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the stuffing cool slightly. Using a spoon, stuff the lamb filling into the eggplants until they feel full, but not overly packed. Arrange the eggplants in a single layer in a large saucepan, pour the chicken stock over them and lay the lemon slices on top of each eggplant, drizzle with some more olive oil. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until fork tender. Garnish with fresh parsley before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 73681,&quot;Grilled Swordfish with Candied Lemon Salad 1/4 cup sugar 2 lemons, segmented 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil<br> 1 1/3 teaspoons kosher salt 4 cups baby arugula 3/4 cup Castelvetrano olives, pitted and halved Four 6-ounce skinless swordfish or tuna steaks Instructions: In a small saucepan combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Add the lemon segments and simmer for another 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cool the lemons in the liquid. Using a slotted spoon, remove the segments from the liquid and reserve both for later use. In a medium bowl, whisk together the mustard and 2 tablespoons of the reserved lemon liquid. Whisk in the olive oil, basil and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Reserve half of the dressing for the fish. Add the arugula, olives and reserved lemon segments to the dressing but do not toss. Set aside. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Dry the fish well using paper towels and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the olive oil. Grill the steaks until golden brown and the fish release easily from the pan, 3 to 4 minutes per side depending on the thickness of the steaks. Toss the salad in the dressing and add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place a piece of fish on each plate and top with some of the salad.

In a small saucepan, warm the milk over low heat. Add the warmed milk and butter to the flour mixture, followed by the eggs and the rum. Use an immersion blender to mix the batter until thoroughly combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or in the refrigerator overnight. To make the crepes, spray an 8-inch saute pan with grapeseed oil spray, wipe it clean, and turn the heat to high. (You&#39;ll know the pan is ready when it just begins to smoke.) Using a 2-ounce ladle, ladle out crepe batter into the hot pan and tilt the pan to spread the batter into an even circle. After 45 seconds, when the top is dry, flip the crepe over and cook on the other side for 20 seconds, until it just starts to brown at the edges. Fold the crepe in half and transfer it to a sheet pan lined with foil. Repeat this process with the remaining crepe batter. Place one crepe on a plate and top with Hot Chocolate Sauce. Fold the sides over and repeat with another crepe on the same plate (you will have two crepes for each serving.) Repeat with the remaining crepes and serve. Place the chocolate in a large bowl and set aside. Combine the water, sugar, cocoa powder, and cream in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate, setting the saucepan aside, and whisk until smooth. Pour the chocolate sauce into a sieve set over the reserved saucepan and keep warm until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 73683,&quot;Polish Honey Cake 1 tablespoon melted butter 2 cups plain fine dry bread crumbs 1 cup honey, plus more, for garnish 1/4 cup brown sugar 4 eggs, separated 1 cup toasted chopped hazelnuts Whipped cream, for garnish Instructions: Brush 4 (1 1/2 cup) brioche tins with melted butter, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs. Set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Put honey in a mixing bowl and set over a pot of steaming water; warm until it gets loose. Add the sugar and egg yolks to the honey, and whisk until frothy. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in remaining 1 3/4 cups bread crumbs and hazelnuts. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff and fold into the batter. Place mixture into the brioche tins and bake for 45 minutes.

Line 13-by-18-by-1-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment so that 2-inches overhang the long sides. Generously grease the parchment and unlined parts of the baking sheet with butter. Use a fine sieve to generously dust a large, clean kitchen towel confectioners&#39; sugar until it is completely covered (about 1/2 cup). Set aside. Beat the eggs in large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until very thick and pale yellow, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the granulated sugar and continue to beat until thick and the sugar has almost dissolved, 3 minutes. Beat in 2/3 cup water and the vanilla. Gradually add flour, beating just until the batter is smooth and no lumps remain. Pour into the prepared baking sheet and spread to the corners. Bake until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Immediately loosen the cake from sides of baking sheet using a paring knife and invert the cake onto prepared towel. Carefully peel off the parchment. Using a sharp Chef&#39;s or serrated knife, cut the hot cake crosswise into four 4-inch-wide strips. Flip each over so that the top of the cake is facing up. Push the strips together so that the cut sides are touching each other and the cake looks whole and uncut. Position the cake so that the long end is facing you. Using the towel to help you, carefully roll cake and towel, forming a tight log. Let log cool on rack for 3 minutes. This will allow the cake to roll without cracking or breaking. Carefully unroll the cake, and let sit on rack until completely cooled. The ends will be curled up and there might be surface cracks on the top of the cake and that&#39;s OK. For the frosting: Beat together the butter and cream cheese in large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup brown sugar and set aside. While beating on high, gradually add the remaining brown sugar (making sure to break up any clumps before you put it in the mixer), vanilla, cornstarch, 2 tablespoons cinnamon and salt until sugar is almost dissolved and no lumps remain, 3 to 5 minutes. If the frosting looks loose, chill for 30 minutes and continue to beat until thick and smooth. Frost the cake with half of the frosting, filling in any cracks and smoothing out the surface.<br> Remove cake strips from towel and arrange on a clean work surface so that the strips are touching (short-end to short-end) to form a long cake strip running the length of your counter. Starting at one end, carefully roll-up 1 of the short ends tight enough so the cake sticks to the frosting but not so tight that the frosting gets squeezed out. Continue rolling-up each successive strip to form a fat roll. Carefully transfer to a cake plate or stand. Press on the sides of the cake to form an even and circular shape. Frost the sides of the cake with 1 cup of the remaining frosting. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes. Frost the sides of the cake again with the remaining frosting making sure it&#39;s about as thick as the inside layer of frosting.<br> Mix together the reserved 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon in small bowl. Pass through a course sieve to break up any lumps. Lightly sprinkle on top of the cake, making the frosting look like the cinnamon part of the cinnamon roll.

Toss the zucchini with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and let sit. Spray the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch metal pan with cooking spray. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and start pressing it into a rectangular shape. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and press it evenly all the way to the edges. Place the pan on the hot pizza stone and partially bake for about 10 minutes. The bottom should be lightly golden brown and crisp. Remove the pan from the oven. Sprinkle the crust with the mozzarella in an even layer. Pat-dry the zucchini and shingle the rounds in a single layer over the mozzarella. Spray the cherry tomatoes with cooking spray and toss with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl, then top the zucchini layer with the tomatoes, olives and feta. Drizzle all over with the olive oil. Return the pizza to the oven and bake until the bottom is deep golden brown and the cherry tomatoes have wilted, 18 to 20 minutes, Top with torn basil leaves. Cut into 8 squares. Stir together the warm water, honey and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Whisk the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl. Add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil and mix together with a stiff rubber spatula. Form the dough into a uniform ball in the center of the bowl. Be sure to scrape and use any dough stuck to the sides. The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on a clean, dry work surface. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface and knead for a couple of minutes, working in just enough flour to make the dough less sticky but still moist to the touch. Form the dough into 1, 2 or 4 balls, for large, medium and small pizzas. Place the dough ball(s) on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes. The dough can then be shaped and cooked as desired or wrapped well and frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw frozen dough at room temperature, shape and cook as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 73689,&quot;Lollipops 36 lollipop sticks 2 cups sugar 2/3 cup water 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 teaspoon flavored extract, optional Instructions: Arrange the lollipop sticks in the lollipop molds and place on a baking sheet.

Slowly bring up to under a boil over medium/medium low heat for 10 minutes or so. As fine bubbles appear at the side of the pot remove a thick piece of Kelp and press your thumbnail into the thickest part of the seaweed. If it pierces the Kelp easily, the flavor has been released. If not, return to the pot for one or two minutes longer. Never allow the water to boil while the Kelp is in the pot. Remove the Seaweed and reserve for other uses. When the stock returns to a boil add 1/2 cup of Spring Water and the Bonito Flakes. Immediately remove from the heat and skim the foam from the surface. When the Bonito Flakes sink to the bottom, strain the stock through a very fine mesh sieve lined with cotton flannel to clarify and remove any particles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling Wine]&quot; 73695,&quot;Mixed Organic Santa Barbara Field Greens with Hazelnut Vinaigrette 1/2 cup Champagne vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 shallot, minced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup hazelnut oil Salt Pepper 12 ounces mixed field greens 1 bunch green asparagus, grilled then diced into 1-inch long pieces 1 sweet white onion, sliced thin 1 cup crushed hazelnuts Instructions: Whisk all ingredients except hazelnut oil together.
