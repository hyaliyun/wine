He'd tasted fruit from Cappella in the 70s. He knew what kind of wine it could make. But that first replant was ill-fated thanks to diseased rootstock, and once again he was ripping out vines.

Typically Roussanne, which is more difficult to ripen and thus more rare, takes a backseat to the Grenache Blanc, which is a more neutral tasting grape.  We like to richen up this blend a bit and include more of the robust Roussanne.  The resulting blend is nearly a 50-50 balance between the two varieties.  The grapes were whole cluster pressed and then fermented and aged together in a small, temperature controlled stainless tank.  This early blending allowed the flavors to come together more completely.  After fermentation, the wine was transferred to neutral French Burgundy barrels to allow a bit more oxygen into the wine, which acted to soften and round out the final wine.  The aroma of this wine explodes with white flowers, green apple, a tropical/banana note, and a flinty/minerally note.  The aromas find their way onto the palate where you will sense a long, round, viscous mouthfeel made complex with a racy acidity.  The RGB is clean, fresh, and ready to drink.  It should, however, improve over the next couple of years."},{"name":"Andrew Murray Enchante 2016","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The French say Enchant when they greet each other.

We craft our wine with the same winemaking regime that the French use to craft their wines. The co-fermentation of the Viognier with the Syrah yields a wine that is slightly softer and smoother for its young age, with the wonderful perfumed highlights of Viognier in the nose. The Viognier also, brings out the elusive candied-violets aroma in Syrah.

The 2009 vintage just begged for a little something extra, and the Viognier delivered by lifting the nose and by helping to keep this Syrah remain yummy and dinstinctive.  The aromas and flavors lean toward bright red fruits...cherries, raspberries, currants, and cranberries, with just a touch of a floral/violet note (from the Viognier) with a spicy note dominated by fresh black pepper and a dose of sweet French oak.

This block was planted in 1989 on a rocky east-facing slope, where the poor, well-drained soil (not to mention Mike Sauer and his sons and crew) helps control vigor and yields.

The Croft SB is filled with ripe fruit, and is equally tamed by the bright acid we've come to associated with the Croft site. Extended lees contact give an unusual textural richness to what otherwise might seem a light bodied wine. Perhaps our best bottling thus far, and should age well for the next 5 to 8 years."},{"name":"Andrew Rich Cuvee B Pinot Noir 2008","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"With its darker color and deep aromas of graphite, crushed red and black berries, and a hint of wild herbs, the Cuve announces itself as a wine that is altogether more \\"serious\\" than the Prelude.  (And for those who have been following this wine for the last 10 vintages, it should be noted that with this vintage the B has been promoted: it is no longer our \\"entry-level\\" Pinot, though in order to attain an elevated rank it was necessary to bottle much less than previouslyabout one-half of normal.)  In the mouth the wine seems more savory than overtly fruity, with a round, sweet, rich mid-palate.  It is full and lush with any excess weight (a hallmark of 2008).  There is excellent length here, with well-integrated tannins and vibrant acidity to keep the wine focused and fresh.  Delicious now, this will go five years at least."},{"name":"Andrew Rich Prelude Pinot Noir 2010","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"A clean, bright nose of cherries and floral notes adds a suggestion of sweetness with air.

They went into harvest strategizing on how to handle a hot dry year, but when five inches of rain fell over four days in late September, their plans went out the window.

The unctuous almost liquid cascade of flavors that first come to mind are greatly colored by this grape. The mid palate is thick and rich with a compelling balance and flow to the palate.

Nevertheless we are ready to agree on the terrific sense of body and pronounced strength of the fruit in the wines being made from the various part of Champoux Vineyard. As much as I fall in love with the wines from Champoux, I have to pull myself back and wait for a few years until the true voicing and pitch of these wines comes forward.

This is a forceful wine with power and grace from the Cabernet Franc. The Merlot in the wine adds fruit and a wonderful sense on the palate of freshness and red berries.

The winery always loves Ciel Du Cheval and while each vintage differs (something they love even more) and has its own unique and usually worthy identity, this year stands out a bit more than usual.

The classic and austere qualities that this vineyard has each year are well drawn out. As with most American wines, this wine projects more fruit in its youth than its European reflections. Over time we will see this difference shrink as the wines move (hopefully) into more complex incarnations of themselves. We would like to see this wine well stored for three or four years. As is almost always true with Andrew Will wines you can enjoy them now, but they will provide greater complexity over time."},{"name":"Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2008","region":"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"This wine is currently the front runner in this release. The blend of structure, power and depth made the wine the favorite in a recent tasting of ten vintages of Ciel du Cheval (the much maligned 2000 vintage was second... so much for ideology).

They have for a few years wanted to make a wine solely from Merlot and Cabernet Franc from Ciel du Cheval. They picked the right year to try as the two varieties I chose are strong in the 2010 vintage. A really finely set structure is aided by the transparent and yet deeply flavored fruit present in the 2010 vintage from this vineyard. Followers of the property will know that a refined and laudatory austerity is one of the hallmarks of the vineyard. Leaving out the Cabernet Sauvignon has brought the vintage into perfect tune."},{"name":"Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2011","region":"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Like the previous vintage, the Ciel does not possess any Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. The wine exhibits hints of damson plum skin, smoke, cardamom and cinnamon. As the wine opens up a secondary layer of minerality reminiscent of river stones emerges.

My partner in the Two Blondes vineyard who knows my wines better than I says this is the best wine made at Andrew Will, and while I don't put much belief in the idea of \\"best\\" wine, I am very happy with the path this wine is taking.

This wine is a dominant expression of Cabernet Sauvignon which exhibits itself in a light made brighter by the addition of Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

We like the persistently bright personality of this vintage of Sorella as well as its ability to cast a shadow into the future."},{"name":"Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2009","region":"Columbia Valley, Washington","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"This wine has a full, beautiful nose with massive structure. There are mineral-like qualities in both the nose and finish, along with scents of deep, recessive fruit and licorice that deliver fully on the palate. The wine's intensity and elegance is highlighted by its rich layering of sweetness and silky tannins."},{"name":"Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2010","region":"Columbia Valley, Washington","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in this year's Sorella is brought upwards with the addition of Merlot and some Cabernet Franc. The base of Cabernet is in itself a great starting place but once the other varieties are added the fruit is put into balance and forcefully shows its varietal character.  This wine says more through a sense of quiet and poise."},{"name":"Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2012","region":"Columbia Valley, Washington","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The gorgeously nose shows a blend of cassis, graphite, river stones, tobacco leaf with hints of black currants and dark rasberry.

Once again the 2013 vintage shows us why Sorella is our flagship wine."},{"name":"Andrew Will Winery Sorella (375ML half-bottle) 2011","region":"Columbia Valley, Washington","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The Sorella is an attractive balance of rich tannins, bright acids, and flavors. On the nose hints of limestone, anise, lavender, blueberries and violet are accompanied by generous and deep fruit qualities.

I like its assertive nose and exuberant body aswell as the clean finish. The wine has much CabernetFranc in it yet seems to have that herbal and mineralside to it that I look for in the wines I taste and buy. Iwas not sure how this vineyard would go but with allthe patience of a saint, Chris Hoon the vineyardmanager, has brought to Andrew Will a truly complexand well ripened fruit.

The work that we have done there with trellising, soil, water, and clonal selections is now bringing it even with the other vineyards from whom we source. The identity is fully apparent in this vintage through its soft texture and very full mid-palate. The depth of flavor reveals much about this vintage and those we hope to see in the future from Two Blondes.

The focused and yet soft middle palate is at once indicative of the vintage and the vineyard's characteristics. The fruit is bright and yet giving. The middle structure of this wine is softly set and so allows for a great deal of immediate pleasure as well as an authentic promise of complexity to come should the wine be stored.  We like it now, if opened for a few hours, with a great variety of food including seafood with almost anything but a cream sauce. Perfect as it is with those foods, it is able to add much to a variety of meats. Anything with a fruit based sauce or smoke is greatly enhanced by the savory kitchen herbal facets of the wine as well as a black fruit profile. Nice wine."},{"name":"Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2011","region":"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The wine possesses extraordinary aromatics and alluring fragrances.

Then Yang kicked in with a vengeance in the form of a very hot, dry east wind during the week of the 22nd of September. 95F on September 27th is unprecedented in our cool climate region! Our fears of splitting and mold were replaced by raisining and shriveling. The solution was to start up our irrigation system in the best vineyard blocks replacing evaporated berry and vine moisture, and allowing us to wait out the heat.

The freshness of the fruit flavors carry all the way through to the end without a dip in the middle palate. This wine is Tannin rich, but tastes like the rough corners of the tannin molecules have been sanded smooth. The finish is long, long of sweet fresh red fruit, with just a hint of fresh spaded earth."},{"name":"Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2002","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The Nuthouse designation is used for our biggest, boldest and most aggressive style of Pinot Noir.

Result: this may be the most interesting, complex, and balanced Pinot Noir we've made here! The aromas jump out of the glass with bright vibrancy. Rich Bing cherry fruit, Santa Rosa plum, pie spices, cinnamon stick, with bouquet of forest loam and woods-edge Northwest bramble fruits make this a very seductive Pinot Noir. The mouth-feel is surprisingly silky and concentrated in texture. The middle palate has delightful juiciness of Bing cherry and red plum fruit.

The obvious notes on the nose of big juicy sweet Oregon blackberries and Rainier cherries have layers of summer cedar forest, strawberry rhubarb cobbler, and roses so deeply red they hurt adding aromatic complexities. Richness is exuded by this wine that has a palate full of berries fresh off the vine and exotic Asian spices, but with a graceful elegance that is anything but cumbersome. It is a rare and beautiful thing to find a Pinot Noir with this much power that still maintains the balance and finesse that defines the best that the varietal can be."},{"name":"Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2009","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"For those of you familiar with the Nuthouse style, you'll know that on release these wines don't always leap out of the glass, they need time in the bottle to open up aromatically.

This wine has a strong affinity to the Pacific Northwest with notes of bilberry, red raspberry, black cherry cordial, Douglas fir bark, and a hint of forest floor. There is a cool, darkness in a palate leaning toward the black fruits C Damson plum, blackberry, black currant, and blackcap. Texturally, the 2010 Nuthouse Pinot Noir is soft, but with generous tannins and a round mouth-feel where deftly handled oak integrates with the fruit profile harmoniously.

Winemaking and blending is all about creating options and tools, so we have taken these three tiny blocks and cut them up into both stainless steel and neutral oak fermentations to give us more tools to play with. The stainless versions are left with a hint of residual sugar, which emphasize fresh, pure, round fruit while the neutral oak barrels are taken bone dry to bring the dichotomic elements of both mineral edge and subtle, creamy texture. The blending between these two styles across the three blocks of Riesling create an excitement and energy in the salvaries. Heavenly white nectarine, lime blossom, and silvery minerality.

Super ripe, deep, blueberry- blackberry jam, tar, earthy, thick, viscous, seasoned cedar, violets, etc. are the terms resonating in both aroma and flavor of this year s offering.  Imagine a blackberry vine visited in early Fall loaded with over-ripe neglected berries.

Argyle's farming culture got the crop level right on. We stripped leaves after the burning sun of August and in time for the Labor Day rains. We also believed September's drying, east wind forecast and put a security of water onto the vines to help them ride out the drying, late season heat with a maximum of ripeningwhich is the name of the game here in the Willamette Valley. Picking was unusually \\"segmented\\" this year. Usually we can say that every 200' rise in elevation can mean 10 days difference in ripening and thus picking. But in 2009 Argyle picked high and low elevation fruit at the same time! We picked all the sparkling fruit, then rested for a couple of days, then all the Chardonnay for still wine, rested another few days then all the red came in. The resulting wines are gorgeous, perky and sexy.

Huge tannin is present along with monstrous extract and richness. Nevertheless, it is an elegant, pure offering displaying the same stunning character as its siblings. Notions of menthol, scorched rocks, mocha, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, and espresso are found in this terrific offering. It will be developed and forward upon release, but will last for 12-15 years.    Winemaker and part owner, John Kongsgaard, produces these wines in partnership with auctioneer, Fritz Hatton. They are all fashioned from fruit grown in the \\"H Block\\" of the Hudson Vineyard, the highest point on that large ranch. The vineyard is planted in white volcanic ash-dominated soils. The Cabernet Franc/Merlot blend is the Arietta and the Syrah/Merlot blend is named Variation One. These striking offerings have a European sensitivity for elegance, structure, and delineation, but are clearly products of California, as evidenced by their prodigious ripeness as well as intensity.

This is another miraculously rich and dramatically aromatic Arietta, and once again is a product of a relatively cool and late vintage.

The core of the H Block cuve comes from thirty-year-old Cabernet Franc vines planted on a rare volcanic outcropping just above the Hudson Merlot Cathedral. The 2016 vintage was co-fermented, taking just the heart of the Merlot block and harvesting it on the same day as the Cabernet Franc. As usual, native yeast fermentation, and a long, carefully controlled maceration helped to meld together the two varieties, bringing forward the best of what they have to offer. After aging for twenty months in two-thirds new French oak, the wine was bottled without fining or filtration to preserve the power and subtlety of the vintage. Aromas of lavender, orange blossom, and anise are in harmony with the ripe Napa Valley fruit profile. Solid and well textured, the wine flows across the palate, blackberry, currant, and black cherry flavors mixed with hints of dried flowers, flint, and black licorice. This vintage of H Block will certainly age for decades to come."},{"name":"Arietta Merlot 1999","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"A dense, rich wine of great power, with firm tannic support, still on the young side.

Whole cluster pressed, the juice was fermented in a combination of Stainless Steel barrels, neutral oak, and new French Oak. Only a small number of barrels were allowed to complete malolactic fermentation, which allows the natural acidity and freshness of the wine to stay in the foreground.?"},{"name":"Arietta Quartet 2012","region":"North Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"After several challenging, yet rewarding vintages, 2012 arrived as a gift from heaven. All four red varieties, in each of the Arietta vineyards, produced rich, aromatic fruit in abundance. It would be hard to exaggerate just how pleasing the wines from this vintage will be. The 2012 Quartet is a great example. The wine has a remarkable purity of fruit, with notes of fresh blueberries, blackberry pie, and crme de cassis, but with all the complexity we desire in Arietta. The many layers include notes of dried sage, licorice, gravel, smoke, and graphite. This wine is generous and hedonistic, yet should appeal to the Europhile as well. The nearly flawless fruit produced wines that required very little movement in the cellar, and, as always, was bottled without fining or filtration, so will pour out of the bottle with great structure and intensity. While Quartet is meant to be enjoyed immediately, this one will no doubt age for decades to come.

How did they do it in the cool vintage of 1998? Continual thinning of crop until a very late pick (end of October) gave them uniform and very ripe fruit.

He is required to blend different fruit and terroir expressions from diverse villages, just as an artist balances colors to complete his work of art. This means that the Barolo Undicicomuni is naturally Arnaldo Riveras most complex Barolo. A shorter ageing in wood, instead of the 32 months of each cru, allows the wine to be more accessible and suitable for early drinking.

Both the Chardonnays and Pinots developed considerably over the time I followed them. Readers should open the wines at least several hours in advance. In general, the 2010s are brighter and more focused than the 2009s, which are more generous. Alcohol levels are also lower across the board in 2010. The Chardonnays spend 10-12 months in barrel, followed by 2 months in oak, and are usually bottled around Christmas. The cellar is kept cold to encourage slow malos, which occur in the spring. The wines are never racked until they are prepared for bottling with no fining or filtration. The Pinots begin their vinification with cold soaks that last 5-6 days. The wines are only racked when they are bottled, which usually takes place in September. Aubert describes his Pinots as largely inspired by his experiences with the Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines he made at a number of properties, including Colgin, Sloan, Bryant and Futo, which remains his only consulting client.

Endowed with poor soil and a Mediterranean climate of sunshine and heat, it is an ideal region for producing very full-flavored wines. Although 13 grape varieties are allowed, the principal one is Grenache, followed by Syrah, Cinsault and Mourvdre.    VINTAGE   The autumn and winter months were characterized by mild temperatures and a lack of rain. The Chateauneuf-du-Pape vineyards were not affected by the frost of April 14th and flowering, followed by the setting of the grapes, took place under the best possible conditions. Heat, sun and relative drought conditions (especially in August) dominated during the vine's growing cycle. 1998 will be remembered as a great vintage for Syrah which has resulted in rich, strong and complex wines. On the other hand the vintage was more difficult with irregular quality for Grenache because of high yields.    WINEMAKING   The greatest difficulty of the year was to manage the excessive yield of the Grenache which led to problems of color dilution in spite of the high potential alcohol level. Winemaker Guy Sarton du Jonchay used the technique of vinifying the Grenache together with the Syrah, which had reached a very high level of concentration because of low yields. This process enabled the Grenache to take on color and substance. This wine bears the Chateauneuf du Pape appellation controlee crest on the bottle and was bottled at the estate in the region where the grapes were grown.    WINEMAKER NOTES   Intense purple hue. Rich and aromatic, typical of Grenache, with a nose of ripe fruit (nectarines) and flowers (violets).

Think of it as a hypothetical blend of our velvety 1993 with the power and muscle of our 1998, but with softer tannin and lower acidity."},{"name":"Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2002","region":"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Possibly the finest wine we have yet made from this hillside vineyard, the 2002 Beaux Freres is an atypically powerful, opulent, flamboyant offering.  Dense ruby/purple with a dramatic display of blackberries, cherry liqueur, new saddle leather, toast and hints of licorice as well as underbrush, this full-bodied wine has revealed a seamlessness since its early days in cask.  Rich, yet with introspection, serious tannin/structure can be found beneath the wealth of fruit and extract.  A very big wine, the 2002 is difficult to compare with our previous eleven vintages, but for those who have followed our wines, it may represent a hypothetical blend of the 1994 and 1999."},{"name":"Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2006","region":"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2006 vintage was a beautiful year of ripeness, and the 2006 Beaux Freres Vineyard shows the exceptional maturity of the grapes and the tannins. Deep ruby/purple-tinged to the rim, with a sweet, ripe nose of black raspberry, kirsch, with some underbrush and spice notes (any evidence of new oak casks is completely obscured by the wines fruit). The wine cuts a broad savory path on the palate and has relatively elevated glycerin and sweet fruit which tends to obscure and hide the significant tannin.

However it developed a beguiling charm and alluring perfume despite not having a lot of weight. The wine had perfect balance in a more delicate style and we have learned a great deal about how a light, delicate style of Pinot Noir can age beautifully.

The nose shows roasted herbs and meatiness with some background notes of sweet cherry, truffle and vegetal qualities. This is a distinctive Pinot Noir with aromatics that are very old-world. In the mouth the wine has always had a certain austerity but a bit of a gap in the middle. The wine has held up nicely over time but has never really developed the sweetness and charm that we would expect of our best Pinot Noirs."},{"name":"Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir 1997","region":"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"This wine was made from modest yields. It still has a dark plum/garnet color, a relatively sweet nose of sandalwood, roasted herbs, sweet and sour cherries and some barrique smells in the background. Medium bodied, a bit tart and angular without the plushness and measured richness that we look for on the mid-palate. Still this wine is very Pinot - lacy and elegant.

Frequent tastings have consistently shown a wine that is deep ruby/purple, with relatively high extract, rich and concentrated - promising yet somehow lacking charm and finesse. Some of the bottles we have opened seemed to have suddenly blossomed. The wine is still very dark and the wine is an adolescent in terms of evolution. We think this wine is just entering its plateau of full drinkability and we are beginning to actually see the high hopes we had for this wine come to fruition."},{"name":"Beaux Freres The Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir 2000","region":"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"An excellent vintage from Ribbon Ridge, our 2000 has a deep saturated ruby/purple color.

Still youthful, this medium to full-bodied wine has a layered palate, moderate tannin and a sweet, long finish. It is always difficult to compare one vintage to another, but 2000 may represent a hypothetical blend of 1998 and 1999. It is not as powerful, muscular or tannic as the 1998 nor as forward, charming and accessible as the 1999.

Since the heat came before color change, rather than at the end of the season as it did in 2003, the grapes actually ripened in relatively cool conditions and therefore have more expressive fruit and more freshness than one might expect from a hot vintage.

Every year since the winery has been able to source small amounts of high quality classic Southern Rhone varieties typically used for CNDP. Mourvedre, Cinsault and Syrah now all play their part in creating the aromatic layering and palate impression. The 2010 vintage comes closest yet: the concentrated black raspberry is expanded by notes of cream, white pepper, lavender blossom and a toasted earth.

Then the aroma takes center stage, with pure, vibrant black cherries, camphor, cocoa and a slight kirsch essence.  Its foundation is a classic, complex expression of Washington Merlot, but since 40% of the blend is made from Petite Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, the aroma takes on additional dimension of anise, rose petal and baking spice.   It enters very supple and plush, with a jolt of black cherry and red berries that stays true to the aroma.  Dried herbs, chocolate and a touch of smoky oak play supporting roles.

You could smell it when you walked up to do a punch down and would smile from ear to ear with anticipation. Then you would get up on the ladder, look down and get nervous. If you fell in no one would see you, it was such a black pit. Next, you would smell the cigar and a hint of leather that warned you to take it seriously.

The dense, compact tannins coat the mouth and the kirsch, rhubarb, roasted fig, cigar box and pepper lay comfortably across the mid-palate. With decanting, the fruit and floral qualities begin to emerge with a sustained finish that builds and lingers. If it is anything like the 2002, 2003 or 2004 vintages that came before it, it will reward several years of bottle age that will allow the the tannins to meld into the increasingly expressive dark fruit core. This is a big wine that balances strength with suppleness."},{"name":"Big Basin Rattlesnake Rock Syrah 2009","region":"Santa Cruz Mountains, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2009 Rattlesnake Rock is a dark, opaque red color. The nose is redolent of lavender, violets, kirsch, anise, stewed plums and hints of black pepper. The wine is intense and tightly wound on the palate with vibrant red and black fruits and anise. Very fine mouth coating tannins finish long with cascading notes of huckleberries. The wine is well structured with plenty of tannin, yet maintains an elegant profile. As with most vintages of Rattlesnake Rock, it will take another year or two for the wine to fully come together and it should age effortlessly for another 10-15 years after that."},{"name":"Big Basin Rattlesnake Rock Syrah 2012","region":"Santa Cruz Mountains, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2012 Rattlesnake Rock Syrah is a well balanced expression of the varietal. Black and red fruit abound, layered with smoked meats and fresh cracked black pepper. There is plenty of perfume on this wine, and the aromatics enthrall with notes of lavender and crushed violets. This is a wine that will really benefit from decanting or bottle aging for another 3-5 years, and you can expect this baby to go the long haul, peaking anywhere from 7-10 years from vintage.

When you nose meets a glass with this wine in it, you will understand why capturing this quality of Syrah is one of the winery's principal goals with this grape. Everyone they've poured this wine for immediately comments they have never smelled Syrah like this before. And the pleasure doesn't stop there. On the palate, this is a classic expression of the varietal: juicy plums, dark berries, iron and pepper. The grapes were fermented 38% whole cluster, which add really nice length to the finish. In short, this will be a hard wine to keeps your hands off from."},{"name":"Big Basin Woodruff Family Vineyard Pinot Noir 2013","region":"Santa Cruz Mountains, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The nose is a nod to Old World Pinot characteristics offering perfumy notes of blood orange, exotic asian spice, rose petals, nutmeg and cinnamon. On the palate, it is silky and vibrant with a long, elegant finish. This is a refined wine, yet powerful with a backbone of acidity and tannin, this wine is hard to resist now, but will likely be the longest lived Woodruff we have produced to date.

Located within the Chalone AVA in the Gabilan Mountains, the organically farmed Antle vineyards limestone and decomposed granite soils are planted to old selections of Chalone, Swan, and Pommard pinot that produce a singularly expressive, intensely aromatic wine of depth, dimension, and structure that we hope transmits some of the vivid natural beauty of this otherworldly site. We picked the 2014 vintage starting at 2am on August 18th under the stars of the Milky Way and the Perseid Meteor showers, to a soundtrack provided by three separate packs of coyotes. After a year and a half in old French barrels and demimuids, we bottled, unfiltered, in January of 2016. \\"The vineyards volcanic soil, granite and limestone nestled high up near the Pinnacles National Park help coax intrigue into these lovely Chalone AVA grapes. Made of organic grapes transformed into a 13-percent-alcohol bouquet of black cherries, earth, cola and mystery herbs, this is one distinctive wine. The tannins rein everything into a well-formed harmony. Birichinos stylistic trend toward mineral-driven, low-alcohol creations is upheld by this muscular creature, more living organism than artifact.

The rich spectrum of aromas is so great that it barely leaves room for the hints of oaky spices to make an appearance. These are hard to pin down, but we think you can find traces of caramel, vanilla and coconut... Smooth mouth-feel with a predominance of sweet, well-rounded tannins, quite a surprise when you remember the age of the wine. A presence of natural acidity which has become blurred and in no way intrudes. There is less fruit and more spiciness in the retro nasal tasting, with cherries but also vanilla, wild shrubs, black pepper and a little leather. The floral nuances disappear in this phase.

The synergy of these sensations creates a really powerful impact on the taster. The features detected in direct olfaction are repeated in retro-olfaction, but almost in reverse order.
