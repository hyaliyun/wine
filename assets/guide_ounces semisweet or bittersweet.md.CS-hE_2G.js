Bring a saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue heat until completely melted, about 1 to 2 minutes more.) Whip the cream in a medium bowl until it holds soft peaks. Take care not to over whip the cream or the mousse will be dense. Cover and refrigerate while you cook the eggs. Whisk the water and espresso powder together in a small bowl. Put the eggs in another bowl that also sets over the water in the saucepan. Beat the egg yolks, pinch of salt, and sugar until foamy and light, about 30 seconds. Set the bowl over the water and whip with an electric mixer or whisk, moving in a circular motion around the bowl, until the eggs get very fluffy and hot to the touch, about 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue beating on high speed until the thick ribbons fall from the beater when lifted out of the bowl, about 5 minutes more. Fold in the espresso. Fold about a quarter of the eggs into the chocolate to lighten it, then fold in the rest of the egg. Finally fold the whipped cream into the chocolate base to make a smooth light mousse. Pour the mousse into 4 serving dishes or wine glasses. Cover and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Serve. For a dark, double-rich mousse, use all bittersweet chocolate instead of the semisweet, and decrease the cream to 3/4 cup. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 64981,&quot;Grilled Rib-Eye Steaks with Mouth-on-Fire Salsa 1 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro Juice of 1 lemon For the steaks: 4 boneless rib-eye steaks (about 12 ounces each and 1 inch thick) 1 tablespoon olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 dried chiles de arbol 8 large tomatillos, husked and rinsed 3 medium heirloom tomatoes (about 1 1/4 pounds) 2 red jalapeno peppers 1 green jalapeno pepper 1 bunch scallions, trimmed Kosher salt Vegetable oil, for the grill 2 cloves garlic Instructions: Make the salsa: Prepare a grill for high heat. In a small heavy skillet, combine the olive oil and chiles de arbol and cook over medium heat, about 4 minutes, or until the chiles are toasted and beginning to blacken. Remove the chiles and set aside. Allow the cl oil to cool slightly. On a large baking sheet, toss the tomatillos, tomatoes, jalapenos and scallions with the cl oil and season with salt. Lightly oil the grill grates with vegetable oil, place the vegetables on the grill and close the lid. Cook the vegetables, turning only once, until they are blackened as much as possible; don&#39;t stress out if the tomatoes and tomatillos break open and begin to fall apart-it&#39;s a sign that they&#39;re cooked through. Aim for these cooking times: 8 minutes per side for the tomatoes and tomatillos, about 6 minutes per side for the jalapenos and about 3 minutes per side for the scallions. Using tongs, transfer the vegetables to the baking sheet and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, let the steaks stand at room temperature, 30 minutes. Trim the stems from the jalapenos and remove the seeds, if desired. Do not remove the charred skins. In a blender, combine the blackened vegetables, the garlic, cilantro, lemon juice and the toasted chiles de arbol and blend until smooth. Season the salsa to taste with salt. (You will have about 5 cups salsa; it will keep for up to 5 days, stored airtight in the refrigerator.) Make the steaks: Reduce the grill heat to medium high. For a gas grill, spread the drained wood chips in the smoker box and close it; alternatively, spread the wood chips in the foil pan. Place the smoke box or foil pan on a lit burner. For a charcoal grill, sprinkle the drained wood chips over the hot coals. Coat the steaks with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. When you see the wood chips beginning to smoke, set the steaks on the grill grate and grill them 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until the meat feels only slightly resilient when pressed with a fingertip, for medium rare. Transfer the steaks to a carving board and let rest, uncovered, about 5 minutes. Serve the steaks with the salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 64982,&quot;Sauteed Strawberry, Sausage and Shrimp Salad 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 pound 26/30 shrimp, peeled, deveined 1/4 cup small-diced yellow onion 1 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 6 ounces precooked Italian sausage, diced small 1/4 cup white wine, such as a Riesling 1 pint strawberries, quartered 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled 1 cup shredded romaine lettuce 2 ounces basil leaves, thinly sliced 2 ounces olive oil 1 teaspoon sea salt Instructions: For the shrimp:<br> In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, allow the grapeseed oil to heat until warmed.

Butter three 9-inch cake pans and dust with cocoa powder, shaking off the excess. Mix the chocolate into the hot coffee in a medium bowl and stir to melt. Set aside to cool completely. In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and baking powder. Set aside. Combine the sugar, oil, salt and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed, 3 to 5 minutes. (This batter is fluid and tends to get lumps; mix carefully with the paddle, or even use the whisk attachment on low speed to avoid lumps.) With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape the bowl and continue mixing on medium-low speed until fully incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes. (Don&#39;t worry about overmixing at this stage; you need to make sure the batter base is fully mixed.) Stir the buttermilk into the coffee mixture. In alternating batches, add the flour and buttermilk mixtures to the batter base. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix. The batter should be thick but fluid. Stir or mix by hand to get rid of any lumps; strain if you feel compelled. Divide the batter among the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely. For the toffee: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the butter, sugar and salt in a heavy-bottom saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium-high heat to 300 degrees F (the hard crack stage), 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour over the prepared baking sheet and let cool completely. Break into small pieces, then process into a powder using a food processor or coffee grinder. For the buttercream: Combine 339 grams of the sugar, the water, corn syrup and salt in a heavy saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium, being careful not to let the flames go up the sides of the saucepan. The target temperature for the syrup is 250 degrees F. Meanwhile, combine the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When the syrup has reached 230 degrees F, run the mixer on medium speed until the egg whites get frothy. Sprinkle the remaining 30 grams sugar into the egg whites and continue to whip on medium speed. (The egg whites should increases in size and form soft peaks by the time syrup reaches 250 degrees F.) Once the syrup reaches 250 degrees F, increase the mixer to high speed and carefully pour the hot syrup down the side of the bowl, being sure not to hit the whip. Whip the mixture until it has cooled to room temperature, 5 to 10 minutes. Replace the whisk with the paddle attachment. Gradually beat in the butter, a few cubes at a time, on medium-low speed. Mix until the buttercream comes together, then mix in the vanilla bean paste. Mix 3 to 4 ounces of the powdered toffee into 1 cup of the buttercream and set aside. For the chocolate feuilletine crunch: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt the dark chocolate and milk chocolate in a double boiler. Remove from the heat and mix in the feuilletine. Spread on the prepared baking sheet and let cool. Crumble into bite-size pieces. Set aside. To assemble the cake: Set one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread with a thin, even layer (about 1/4 inch) of the buttercream, then spread with a thin, even layer (1/8 to 1/4 inch) of the toffee-buttercream mixture. Top with feuilletine crunch. Repeat with the remaining layers. Cover the cake with the remaining buttercream. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 64989,&quot;Marinated Skirt Steak with Quick-Pickled Feta 4 tablespoons canola oil, divided 1 1/2 to 2 pound piece skirt steak Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 cloves garlic, peeled and grated on a vegetable grater or zester, or pressed in garlic press 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, stemmed and leaves coarsely chopped (about 2 teaspoons) 2 teaspoons fennel seeds, lightly toasted and crushed 4 ounces feta, crumbled 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons dried oregano 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: For the steak: Heat a cast iron or heavy-bottomed skillet and add half of the oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper and use a pair of tongs to carefully drop it into the hot oil in the skillet. Cook it on the first side for 1 minute and then turn it on the second side for another minute. In a small bowl, stir together the garlic, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, and fennel seeds. Remove the steak from the skillet; it will still be barely cooked. Use the back of a spoon to spread the garlic mixture on both sides of the steak and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Refrigerate for a few hours and allow it to marinate or simply sear it again and serve. For the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the feta cheese with the red wine vinegar, oregano, and olive oil. Stir to blend. Set aside To assemble: When ready to serve the steak, wipe out the grease and anything sticking to the bottom of the skillet. Heat the skillet again and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Sear the steak again and cook to desired temperature. For medium rare, cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove the steak from the skillet and place it on a flat surface. Cut against the natural grain of the meat to tenderize. Top with the feta dressing. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 64990,&quot;Baked Green Bean Fries Cooking spray 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 tablespoon milk<br> 8 ounces green beans, trimmed<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

In a small bowl, mix the granulated sugar with the cinnamon and set aside. In a medium-sized bowl, lightly whisk the eggs, milk and lemon zest. Blend in the flour just until mixed (the batter will be slightly lumpy). In the skillet, melt 1/4 cup of the butter over medium heat. Add the apples and saute for 5 minutes or until tender. Pour the egg batter over the apples and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes or until the apples are tender and the pie puffs up high. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1/4 cup butter. Remove the skillet from the oven, drizzle the puff pie with the butter and sprinkle with the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Return the pie to the oven for 5 minutes or until the sugar mixture is bubbly. Sprinkle with a little confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately, right from the skillet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 64993,&quot;Peach Peppadew Pork Pops One 12-ounce bottle peach pop One 13-ounce jar peach preserves<br> 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger<br> 2 cloves garlic, zested on a rasp<br> 1/2 cup chopped pickled piquante peppers, such as Peppadews<br> 2 racks spare ribs (St. Louis-style works best), individually sliced into single ribs<br> Instructions: Add about three-quarters of the peach pop to a small saucepot along with the peach preserves, vinegar, soy, ginger and garlic. Simmer until everything dissolves and it thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. (If the sauce gets too thick, thin it out with a little more peach pop.) Add the chopped peppers and let cool. Reserve half the sauce for glazing and dunking. Add the ribs to a large resealable bag. Add the other half of the peach sauce and marinate the ribs, refrigerated, at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Heat a smoker or grill with a smoker box with a 2-stage fire (one side hot, one side low) to 275 degrees F. Place the ribs directly on the cooler side of the grill and add wood chips to the smoker or smoker box. Cook for 1 hour. Baste the ribs with the peach sauce. Continue to cook, basting once an hour, until very tender, another 2 hours. If you prefer your ribs extra crispy, increase the heat to medium-high and baste with more peach sauce, then continue to grill until the ribs are caramelized and charred, 4 to 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 64994,&quot;Outdoor Grilled Striped Bass with Vegetable Tian and Basil Cream 2 eggplants, medium sized (3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter) Homemade herb oil, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil 7 onions, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick 4 fennel, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick, reserve the tops for the striped bass and for garnishing the plate 5 sprigs thyme 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup golden raisins 1/2 cup Champagne vinegar 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts 3 zucchini, sliced into 24 (1/4-inch) rings * (See Cook&#39;s Note) 3 yellow squash, sliced into 24 (1/4-inch) rings * 5 tomatoes, sliced into 24 (1/4-inch) rings * Basil Cream, recipe follows 8 (7 to 8-ounce) striped bass fillets, skin-on 1 cup chopped fennel tops, reserved from above Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup rosemary leaves, stems removed 2 cups olive oil 1/2 cup tarragon leaves 1/4 cup thyme leaves 2 cups white wine 6 cloves garlic 4 cups cream 4 cups basil leaves, loosely packed 1 tablespoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch rounds. Liberally coat the eggplant in herb oil and season with salt and black pepper. Spread the eggplant out in 1 layer in a baking dish and bake for about 20 minutes or until they are fully cooked and soft to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the sliced onion, fennel, and thyme and allow the mixture to cook while stirring frequently. Once the onions and fennel have wilted, about 5 minutes, add the sugar and continue to cook until all excess liquid has dissolved and the mixture begins to caramelize on the bottom of the pan. This takes about 30 minutes. Add the golden raisins. Deglaze the pan with the Champagne vinegar and mix well. Mix in the toasted pine nuts and remove any stems of the thyme. Let cool. Place the roasted eggplant rings on sheet pan spaced equally apart. Top off each ring with the onion and fennel mixture, forming a flat base for the zucchini, yellow squash and tomato slices. Alternate the zucchini, yellow squash and tomato slices around the top of the onion and fennel mixture by layering each piece on top of one another in a circle, tucking under the last piece to form a full, cohesive circle. Top each tian with herb oil, salt and black pepper. Place in the oven to heat for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. In a pot over medium heat, heat the basil cream and check for seasoning. Preheat a grill to high. Working with the skin side up, use a sharp knife and cut on the bias, to make an incision in the center of each fillet. The incision should not go all the way through to the other side, but should create a pocket. Stuff each incision with a healthy pinch of the fennel tops. Season each fillet with salt and pepper and coat them with homemade herb oil. Grill over high heat. Each fillet will take approximately 6 to 8 minutes to cook (3 to 4 minutes on each side). Using a spatula, carefully place a vegetable tian on each plate. Pour the basil cream around each tian. Place 1 of the striped ref=\\http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/bass/index.html\\ class=\\crosslink\\ debug=\\2184 2196&gt;bass fillets on each plate. Garnish the plate with the remaining fennel tops. Place the rosemary and the olive oil in a blender and cover. Blend on high speed until the roasemary has been ground into small pieces. Add the tarragon and thyme and continue blending until all the herbs have been broken down into small pieces. Pour into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. In a saucepot, add the white wine and garlic cloves. Over medium heat, allow the wine to reduce by half. Add the cream and salt and bring to a boil. Add the basil to the cream and allow it to cook for 1 minute, making sure it is fully immersed so no browning occurs. In a blender, blend the cream mixture in a medium sized batches on high until the mixture is bright green (about 2 or 3 minutes). Immediately pour the cream into a container resting in ice to chill. Stir constantly. Continue this process until all the cream is blended and cooled rapidly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 64995,&quot;Rosemary-Garlic Roasted Potatoes 4 pounds new potatoes, scrubbed, halved 2 heads garlic, cloves separated 4 tablespoons rosemary, chopped 1/4 cup olive oil Kosher salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Arrange sliced eggplant in a single layer on 2 sheet pans. Brush on both sides using 3 tablespoons of oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast the eggplant until it is soft and golden. Turn slices halfway through, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the sliced mushrooms. Saute until soft for about 7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and chopped thyme. Cook for another 2 minutes. Once the mushrooms are cooked remove and set aside to cool. In a large bowl add the ricotta, eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan, oregano, mushrooms, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Mix well. Brush an 8-inch baking dish with oil. Spread half of the marinara sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay 4 slices on top followed by the ricotta mixture. Lay another 4 slices of eggplant and finish with marinara sauce. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Bake until golden brown, at 350 degrees, for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel 5 cloves garlic and place them in a square of foil. Sprinkle the cloves with salt and pepper and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Wrap up the foil and place it directly on the oven rack. (Be sure that the foil packet is secure so no oil will leak out.) Roast the garlic until it&#39;s brown and tender, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool enough to touch and squeeze the garlic from the skins. Set aside. Saute onions and carrots with the oil in a medium saucepan. Add tomato paste and stir well. This will cook off the tomato paste and give a nice orangy color. Cook for about 10 minutes. When vegetables are softened add the roasted garlic, salt, pepper, basil, oregano and stir together until incorporated. Pour in the tomatoes. Fill the empty can with water and add it to the pan.

Gradually add the coconut milk and whisk until smooth, about 5 minutes; set aside. (You can refrigerate the sauce, covered, up to 2 days; reheat before serving.) Make the churros: Bring the milk, butter, sugar, vanilla and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring, until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat to medium low; add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture gathers into a glossy ball, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time with a mixer. Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip. Fill a shallow dish with sugar for coating the churros (about 1/2 cup). Heat about 2 inches vegetable oil in a wide saucepan until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches of about 6, pipe 3-inch-long segments of batter into the hot oil; use a knife to cut off the segments. Fry, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. (Return the oil to 350degrees F between batches.) Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain briefly, then roll in the sugar. Serve with the coconut sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65000,&quot;Watermelon Pull-Apart Cupcake Cake 5 1/4 cups white buttercream or frosting Green gel food coloring<br> Deep pink gel food coloring Red gel food coloring<br> 19 of your favorite cupcakes<br> 30 mini black jelly beans<br> Instructions: Reserve about 3/4 cup white buttercream in a pastry bag fitted with a large plain round tip. Color about 1 1/2 cups buttercream deep green. Color about 3 cups buttercream deep pink, with a few drops of red added to make the color of ripe watermelon. Arrange 19 cupcakes in a triangle shape, starting with 1 at the top and ending with 6 at the bottom, sloping the bottom sides up to resemble the curved rind of a watermelon wedge. Use an ice cream scoop or large spoon to dollop about 1/4 cup green buttercream on each of the 6 cupcakes in the bottom row. Smooth with a small offset spatula, covering the tops and sides (but not the paper liners), to make a solid line of green for the rind. Wash and dry the ice cream scoop and offset spatula. Dollop about 1/4 cup pink buttercream on each of the remaining cupcakes and smooth the tops and sides with the offset spatula. Shape the frosting on the top cupcake into a point to resemble the tip of a watermelon wedge.<br> Wash the offset spatula again. Pipe a curved line of white buttercream along where the pink and green buttercream meet.

In large bowl, break up cookie dough. Stir or knead in cranberries and pecans. Work with half of dough at a time; refrigerate remaining dough until needed. Drop dough by well-rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake 9 to 13 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. In small microwavable bowl, microwave white chocolate chunks and oil on High 30 seconds. Stir; if necessary, microwave 10 to 15 seconds longer until smooth. Place melted chocolate in small resealable food-storage plastic bag; seal bag. Cut 1/8-inch hole in bottom corner of bag. Squeeze bag gently to drizzle white chocolate over cookies. Let stand until white chocolate is set, about 40 minutes. Store between sheets of waxed paper in tightly covered container. Dried cherries and macadamia nuts can be used in place of the dried cranberries and pecans. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Port]&quot; 65002,&quot;White Chocolate Bark 1/2 cup whole shelled salted pistachios 16 ounces good white chocolate, finely chopped 1/4 cup dried cranberries 1/4 cup medium-diced dried apricots Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using a pencil, draw an 8-by-10-inch rectangle on a piece of parchment paper. Turn the parchment paper over so the pencil mark doesn&#39;t get onto the chocolate and place it on a sheet pan. Place the pistachios in one layer on another sheet pan and bake for 8 minutes. Set aside to cool. Place three quarters of the white chocolate in a heat-proof glass bowl and put it in the microwave on high for 30 seconds. (Time it with your watch for accuracy.) Stir the chocolate with a rubber spatula, return it to the microwave for another 30 seconds, then stir again. Continue to heat and stir in 30-second intervals until the chocolate is just melted. Immediately stir in the remaining chocolate and allow it to sit at room temperature, stirring often, until it&#39;s completely smooth. (If you need to heat it a little more, place it in the microwave for another 15 seconds.) Pour the melted chocolate onto the parchment paper and spread it lightly to fill the drawn rectangle. Sprinkle the top evenly with the cooled pistachios, the cranberries, and apricots. Press the nuts and fruit lightly so they will set in the chocolate. Set aside for at least 2 hours until firm or refrigerate for 20 minutes.

Butter a 1-quart casserole dish or baking pan. In a medium saucepan combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon of the flour, berries and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat and set aside. In a medium bowl, use a pastry blender or two knives to cut the butter into the remaining 2 cups flour. Stir in just enough milk to make a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out on a lightly-floured board and pat into a square. Use a rolling pin to roll it to 1/2-inch thick. Cut the dough into 2-inch-wide strips. Pour 1 cup of the blackberry mixture into the bottom of the pan. Arrange half of the dough strips on top of the blackberry mix, placing them close together. Bake until brown, about 12 minutes, then remove from the oven and pour the remaining berry mixture over the baked strips. Arrange another layer of dough strips on top and bake until brown, about 15 minutes.

Butterfly each chicken breast, cutting horizontally into the thickest part of the breast almost all the way through to the other side (keeping the breast attached on one side). Open each breast like a book and pound to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick using the flat side of a meat mallet. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Place a spoonful of the ricotta mixture in the center of each chicken breasts, then fold the chicken over to enclose the filling. Wrap each chicken breast with 2 slices prosciutto, overlapping them slightly. Wrap each chicken breast in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Unwrap the chicken breasts and place on a rimmed baking sheet or shallow baking dish. Drizzle with EVOO, then bake until the chicken is cooked through and the prosciutto is crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. While the chicken bakes, heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the panko and thyme and cook, stirring, until the panko is golden. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano. Divide the chicken among plates.

In the bowl of a mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the eggs and sugar together until very light yellow and fluffy. Mix in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Rest the mixing bowl in the saucepan, with the bowl&#39;s base resting above, not in, the simmering water (pour out some water if necessary). Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thickened and custard-like, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, half-fill a large bowl with ice and cover with cold water. Remove the bowl with the custard in it from the hot water and whisk in the butter until melted. Rest the bottom of the bowl in the ice bath and let cool, folding the mixture occasionally to cool and thicken it. In a mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the cream until stiff. Fold into the cooled lemon custard. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. (The recipe can be made up to this point and kept refrigerated up to 3 days in advance.) Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Flour a work surface and lay out the puff pastry. Roll the sheets lightly with a rolling pin until smooth and flattened. Use your large cookie cutter to cut out rounds from the puff pastry. Hollow out the centers by pushing halfway down with your small cookie cutter. Do not pull out the centers yet; you&#39;ll do that after they are baked. Arrange on an un-greased cookie sheet and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. After 10 minutes, rotate the pan to ensure even cooking. When baked, immediately remove to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature. Cut around the centers with a paring knife to loosen, but don&#39;t cut all the way through to the bottom. You want to leave a thin layer of pastry to hold the filling. Pull out the centers to make a hollow in the center of each pastry round.

Rub the steaks with the oil and seasonings and set aside at room temperature while grill heats. When the grill feels medium-hot when you hold your hand 5 inches over the fire, it is ready to use. Place the steaks on the grill and cook them for 5 minutes on each side for medium.<br> For the cl sauce: Place the cl paste, tomato, cumin, and honey in a blender and puree until smooth. Adjust seasonings with salt. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the puree and cook for 3 minutes, until the flavors are well combined. Use the sauce immediately on enchiladas, or store in a glass container in the refrigerator until ready to use. Keeps for a week. At serving time, place the steaks on 4 plates and top each steak with 2 hot Caciotta Cheese Enchiladas. Serve immediately. Lightly grease an 11 3/4 by 7 1/2-inch glass baking pan. Set aside. Heat the oil in a small skillet over low heat, until it&#39;s hot enough to sizzle when a tiny piece of tortillas is dropped in. Using tongs, dip a tortilla into the hot oil, removing it quickly and letting excess oil drip off. Dip tortilla into cl sauce and lay it on a flat surface. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the cheese down the center of the tortilla and roll the tortilla from 1 end to the other. Lay the enchilada in the prepared pan with the seam down. Repeat the steps with each tortilla, fitting them tightly into the pan. Pour the remaining cl sauce over the top of the enchiladas and sprinkle them with the remaining cheese. Prepare these as close to serving time as possible. To finish the enchiladas, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and bake them for 12 minutes. Serve at once. Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl, blending well to evenly distribute the spices. Be sure to break up any chunks that appear. Store the blend in an airtight container. Shake or stir it again before each use. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 65020,&quot;Creamy Lemon Pie 1 (16 oz.) container sour cream 1 (14 oz.) can Eagle Brand?

Spray one 9 by 17-inch sheet tray with vegetable spray, line with parchment paper and spray again. In a mixer, using the whip attachment, whip the egg yolks and the sugar until doubled in volume and pale yellow; add vanilla extract. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder and powdered sugar twice. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl, running at slow speed, until fully incorporated. In a clean and greaseless bowl, whip the egg whites until firm but not dry. Incorporate a fifth of the whipped egg whites into the cocoa mixture and mix until well incorporated. Fold the remaining egg whites into the cocoa mixture in 3 batches and immediately spread onto a large baking sheet using an offset spatula, being careful not to overwork the dough. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Immediately run the tip of a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen it from the sides of the sheet tray then slide it (with the parchment paper) onto a cool surface. Trim dry edges of the cake. Vanilla Cream Filling: With an electric mixer, beat together the butter and the vegetable shortening until blended. Turn the mixer down to its lowest setting and gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Turn the mixer back up and beat at high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the vanilla and corn syrup until the filling is the consistency of sour cream, about 2 minutes more. Using a sharp knife, cut the cake in half lengthwise. Using an offset spatula, spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of vanilla cream filling over half of the cake and cut into 5 equal sections per half. Roll up each section tightly (peeling off parchment paper as you roll) and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Melt the bittersweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler and add cocoa butter or vegetable oil. Place the rolls 1 at a time directly in the double boiler of melted chocolate. Coat each roll completely in the chocolate. Using two forks, carefully transfer the rolls to a parchment-lined tray, allowing any excess chocolate to drip back into the double boiler. Continue with the remaining rolls, pouring more of the chocolate onto the plate as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65023,&quot;Shrimp Tostadas with Avocado-Tomatillo Salsa 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more, for the grill grates 1 clove garlic, quartered 1 jalapeno, quartered, seeded for less heat 1 small onion, quartered 4 tomatillos (about 8 ounces), husked and coarsely chopped 1/2 ripe avocado, seeded, peeled and chopped Kosher salt 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped, plus whole leaves, for serving 1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp (about 30), peeled and deveined One 15- to 16-ounce can refried beans 1 head romaine, thinly sliced 8 corn tostadas Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil the grates.

Bring to a boil and add the shrimp, then cover with a lid and turn off the heat. Poach the shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. Cut each shrimp in half lengthwise. In a large mixing bowl, add the remaining lime juice, the tomatoes, cilantro, oil, agave, tomatillos, garlic, shallots and 1 teaspoon salt, and stir together. Fold in the shrimp, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 hours. For the chips: Set two racks in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the lime zest on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high heat in 1-minute intervals until completely dried out, stopping to stir after each interval. Reserve for a later use. Stack the tortillas and cut into sixths, then divide the pieces between two large baking sheets and spray evenly with the cooking spray. Bake until crispy, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the dried lime zest, garlic powder, paprika and salt in a spice grinder and blend to a fine powder. Spray the chips once more with the cooking spray then sprinkle all over with the spice powder. For the beans and chorizo: Put the black beans and bay leaf in a medium saucepan, and fill with cold water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, partially covered, until the beans are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain the beans and discard the bay leaf. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan set over medium-high heat and add the chorizo. Cook until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chorizo to a bowl. To the pan, add the onions, red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers and 1 teaspoon salt, and cook until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cumin, ancho powder and chipotle powder, and cook until the spices are lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chorizo, beans and stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the stock reduces by half and the mixture thickens, 6 to 8 minutes. Season with more salt if needed. For the cheese sauce: Heat the oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions, and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the stock, cauliflower, squash and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender and carefully blend until completely smooth. Return the sauce to the pan set over low heat and add the Cheddar, Parmesan and chiles. Stir until the cheese melts. Taste and add more salt if needed. For the cl and cilantro sauce: Preheat a grill pan to medium-high heat. Grill the garlic, Anaheim chiles and poblanos on all sides until deeply charred, about 15 minutes. Remove the skins from the garlic, and set aside. Place the peppers in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Steam the peppers for at least 5 minutes, then peel the skin away from the flesh. Halve the peppers and remove the seeds. In the pitcher of a blender, add the peppers, garlic, cilantro, sour cream, yogurt, scallions, agave, salt, lime juice and lime zest. Blend until smooth. For the nachos: Divide the chips among 8 small plates or bowls, and then top with 1/4 cup of the black bean and chorizo mixture, 1/4 cup of the cheese sauce, 1/3 cup of the shrimp ceviche and a drizzle of the creamy cl and cilantro sauce (about 1 tablespoon). Top each with 1 tablespoon of the queso fresco and a sprinkle of the cilantro leaves to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 65025,&quot;Lemon and Berry Icebox Cake 1 quart heavy cream 1 cup powdered sugar<br> 1 tablespoon clear imitation vanilla<br> One 25-ounce package lemon sandwich cookies<br> One 11-ounce jar raspberry preserves (about 1 cup)<br> 1/2 cup fresh raspberries<br> One 11-ounce jar blueberry preserves (about 1 cup)<br> 1/2 cup fresh blueberries<br> 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves<br> Instructions: Place the cream, powdered sugar and vanilla in a large bowl and, using a hand mixer, whip until stiff.

Make a double boiler by setting a large mixing bowl over the simmering water. Place the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and honey in the mixing bowl and make an egg foam by whisking the mixture to 113 degrees F (45 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, about 7 to 10 minutes. The egg foam passes through various stages becoming foamy, then smooth and finally it thickens. When it is thick, it will be hot to the touch, tripled in volume, and light in color and the sugar will have completely dissolved. If you dip the whisk into the mixture and pull it out, the batter should fall back into the bowl in a thick ribbon. Remove the mixing bowl from the heat and whip the batter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it cools, increases in volume, stiffens slightly and becomes pale yellow, about 7 to 10 minutes. Take the time to whip it well; if the mixture is underwhipped, the baked genoise will be dense. Very, very carefully, fold in the flour with a rubber spatula until the flour is no longer visible, making sure to fold to the bottom of the bowl. Do not overmix or the batter will deflate. I bake the genoise on a baking sheet 99 percent of the time because then I can cut it to any size I want. Spread the batter over a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven until lightly and evenly browned and springy to the touch, about 10 minutes. If using cake pans, fill buttered and parchment paper-lined 8-inch round cake pans three quarters full. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until well-risen and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Genoise is baked at a higher temperature for a shorter period of time on a baking sheet than when baked in a cake pan to allow it to retain moisture; if overbaked, it will be dry and crunchy. Let the genoise cool slightly. Unmold and finish cooling on a wire rack to allow the air to circulate evenly around the cake. The baked genoise can be stored in the freezer for 2 to 3 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Return it to room temperature before using it. VARIATION: You can easily make this recipe into a Chocolate Genoise by substituting unsweetened cocoa powder for 10 to 20 percent of the weight (a scant 1/4 cup to a full 1/3 cup/0.8 to 1.6 ounces/25 to 50 grams) of the flour. Weigh the cocoa powder before you sift it. SIDEBAR: Genoise can be made with butter. In this recipe, you can substitute butter (5 1/2 tablespoons, 2.7 ounces or 75 grams) for the 3 large egg yolks. Melt and cool the butter and fold it in after the flour is added. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65027,&quot;Chicken Wings with Buffalo Sriracha, Bourbon Teriyaki, Szechuan Garlic and Parmesan Sauces 30 pieces medium drumettes and flats 4 ounces salt<br> 3 quarts vegetable oil<br> 1 cup potato starch<br> 3 cups Louisiana hot sauce 2 cups white vinegar<br> 4 ounces sriracha<br> 2 tablespoons sriracha powder<br> 1 tablespoon soy lecithin powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum<br> 6 sticks butter<br> 2 quarts Shaoxing wine 1 quart soy sauce<br> 4 cups dark brown sugar<br> 2 cups rice wine vinegar<br> 1 cup bourbon<br> 4 ounces minced garlic<br> 4 ounces minced ginger<br> 2 ounces cornstarch 1 ounce Szechuan peppercorns 7 ounces grated Parmesan 3 ounces garlic powder<br> 1 ounce Korean red pepper flakes<br> 1 quart vegetable oil 4 ounces minced garlic<br> 3 ounces dried red pepper<br> Instructions: For the double fried wings: Put the wings in a large container and pour the salt and 2 gallons of water over the top. Let the brine wings sit, refrigerated, for at least 12 hours. For the buffalo sriracha sauce: Combine hot sauce, vinegar, sriracha, sriracha powder, soy lecithin powder and xanthan gum in a blender. Melt the butter for about 10 minutes over medium heat. Turn blender on low speed and slowly add butter. Add until all of it has been well blended. For the bourbon teriyaki glaze: Combine wine, soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, bourbon, garlic and ginger in a pot. Bring to the boil and simmer for 20 minutes. Combine cornstarch with 2 cups water in a bowl, then add cornstarch slurry to the sauce and bring back to the boil for 10 minutes. Simmer and stir until it thickens. Let cool for 20 minutes, then blend until completely purified. For the Szechuan Parmesan dry rub: Toast the peppercorns in a pan over medium heat until fragrant, being sure to avoid any charring or burning, then blend to a coarse grain. Mix together with the Parmesan, garlic powder and pepper flakes and store in a dry container. For the Szechuan garlic oil: Put oil, garlic and pepper in a pot over medium heat for about 20 minutes to allow flavors to infuse. Cool to room temperature, then store in a dry squeeze bottle. For the double fried wings: Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the potato starch and 1 cup water in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Dip the wings into the slurry and then into frying oil. Cook for approximately 4 minutes. Take the fried wings out and put them back into the slurry, then fry again for approximately 3 minutes more. Toss a third of the wings in the buffalo sauce and a third in the teriyaki glaze. Lightly coat the remaining third of the wings in the Szechuan garlic oil, then sprinkle the Szechuan Parmesan dry rub over them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65028,&quot;Sauteed Escarole \\Agrodolce<br> 3 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup dried currants 3 tablespoons pine nuts 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Pinch red pepper flakes 2 cloves garlic, grated 1 pound escarole, roughly chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Pour the vinegar over the currants in a small bowl and let sit until the currants are plump, at least 10 minutes.

Wrap the sweet potatoes together in a foil packet. Place the packet on a baking sheet. Roast until the potatoes are very tender, about 45 minutes. Allow the sweet potatoes to cool, then scrape the flesh out of the skins. Discard the skins and set the sweet potatoes aside to prepare the hummus. Add the chickpeas, sweet potato, lemon juice, tahini and garlic to the bowl of a large food processor. Pulse until it becomes a smooth puree, 1 to 2 minutes. With the machine on, drizzle in the olive oil. Season with the salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste. Store, refrigerated, in an airtight container, for 1 to 2 weeks. For the power wraps: Place 1 tortilla on a work surface. Spread about 2 tablespoons sweet potato hummus around the tortilla, leaving a 1-inch border clear of hummus.

Add the garlic cloves and bring the oil to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Strip the leaves off 2 sprigs rosemary and chop to make 2 tablespoons. Add the rosemary to the garlic and cook until the cloves are golden brown, about 10 minutes, tossing occasionally with tongs. Remove the skillet from the heat and allow the garlic to cool in the oil. In a mortar or on a cutting board, mash the garlic into a paste. Mix the mashed garlic with the reserved oil and rosemary. You should have about 1/2 cup of paste. Place the meat on a hot grill and cook until well browned on both sides, about 5 minutes on the first side and 3 minutes on the second side. Cut 2 lemons in half and cut ends off. Brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the lemons on the grill with the steaks and serve with the steak. Smear 2 generous tablespoons of the paste over the first seared side of each steak. Place the steaks, paste side facing up, on the grill rack. Finish cooking on the cool side of the grill, with the lid on or in the oven until done to your preference, 10 to 12 minutes for rare (remove when an instant-read thermometer registers 120 degrees F). Remove the steaks from the grill and allow the steaks to rest on the rack for about 10 minutes. Cover and keep warm while resting. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board. Cut between the bone and meat of each steak. Cut each steak crosswise into 1-inch slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM blend]</p><p>&quot; 65036,&quot;Fried Sweet Potatoes Vegetable oil for frying 3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/4inch strips 1 tablespoon kosher or coarse salt Instructions: In a large heavy saucepan or deep fat fryer, heat 4 to 5 inches of vegetable oil to 360/. Rub the potato strips with the salt. Fry the potatoes, in several batches to prevent overcrowding and sticking, for 2 to 3 minutes, until cooked through but not colored. Be sure to return the oil to 360 degrees before cooking the next batch, or the potatoes will absorb too much oil and be greasy. Set the potatoes aside on paper towels until you have finished cooking all of them, then increase the temperature of the oil to 390 degrees. Refry the potatoes, again in batches. This time they will take very little time to become crisp, golden brown, and puffy (keep the first batches warm in a low oven while you finish frying, and again be sure to return the oil to 390 degrees for the subsequent batches). Remove with a slotted spoon to drain briefly on paper towels. Serve while hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Vermentino]&quot; 65037,&quot;Foolproof Turkey Breast 1 (14 to 16-pound) fresh turkey Brine, recipe follows 1 tablespoon dry rubbed sage 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pepper 1 teaspoon oregano 1 teaspoon thyme 1 lemon, zested 1 tablespoon canola oil 6 quarts water 8 cups ice cubes 1 cup kosher salt 1/3 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup molasses 7 fresh sage leaves 1 tablespoons black peppercorns Instructions: Remove the legs and wings from the turkey, or have your butcher do it.

Bring 2 to 3 cups of water to a boil and drop in the onions for 1 minute. Remove the onions from the pot, allow them to cool, and then peel. You should be able to slide the onions right out of their skin. Set aside. Sprinkle the chicken on all sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the chicken pieces, a few at a time, into a large (1 or 2-gallon) sealable plastic bag along with the flour. Shake to coat all of the pieces of the chicken. Remove the chicken from the bag to a metal rack. Add the 2 tablespoons of water to a large, 12-inch saute pan over medium heat along with the salt pork. Cover and cook until the water is gone, and then continue to cook until the salt pork cubes are golden brown and crispy, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the salt pork from the pan and set aside. In the same pan, using the remaining fat, add the pearl onions, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and saute until lightly brown, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan and set aside. Next, brown the chicken pieces on each side until golden brown, working in batches if necessary to not overcrowd the pan. Transfer the chicken into a 7 to 8-quart enameled cast iron Dutch oven. Add the mushrooms to the same 12-inch saute pan, adding the 1 tablespoon of butter if needed, and saute until they give up their liquid, approximately 5 minutes. Store the onions, mushrooms and pork in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use. Pour off any remaining fat and deglaze the pan with approximately 1 cup of the wine. Pour this into the Dutch oven along with the chicken stock, tomato paste, quartered onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Add all of the remaining wine. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the chicken in the oven and cook for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is tender. Maintain a very gentle simmer and stir occasionally. Once the chicken is done, remove it to a heatproof container, cover, and place it in the oven to keep warm. Strain the sauce in a colander and remove the carrots, onion, celery, thyme, garlic, and bay leaf. Return the sauce to the pot, place over medium heat, and reduce by 1/3. Depending on how much liquid you actually began with, this should take 20 to 45 minutes. Once the sauce has thickened, add the pearl onions, mushrooms, and pork and cook for another 15 minutes or until the heated through. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, remove from the heat, add the chicken and serve. Serve over egg noodles, if desired. Cook?s Note: If the sauce is not thick enough at the end of reducing, you may add a mixture of equal parts butter and flour kneaded together. Start with 1 tablespoon of each. Whisk this into the sauce for 4 to 5 minutes and repeat, if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 65042,&quot;Cinnamon Churros with Mexican Chocolate Dipping Sauce 8 cups canola oil, for frying 1 1/2 cups Mexican chocolate 3/4 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 3 medium eggs 1 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Instructions: In a large Dutch oven or countertop fryer using a high heat thermometer, bring the canola oil to 375 degrees F.

As long as you&#39;ve got some raw garlic to rub on the &#39;pane bruscato&#39; (toasted bread) and some good olive oil you can make bruschetta. Anything you put on top after that, from leftover meat, shellfish or even simple anchovies - will be delicious. One of my favourite combos is leftover lamb, fresh mint and a splash of sherry vinegar... come on!<br> These roasted vegetable bruschetta are delicious and easy. All you have to do is season and dress the leftover roasted veggies carefully to bring them back to life and you&#39;ve got a perfect snack or light lunch. Gennaro has his way, and I have mine! Roast Vegetable Mega Mix Pop the bread on a hot griddle pan and toast it on both sides. While that&#39;s happening, use the back of a fork or knife to roughly mash up the beetroot, turnip, and parsnip on a wooden board. Season with salt and pepper, drizzle over some extra-virgin olive oil and a little splash of balsamic, then mash again. Once your bread has nice char marks on both sides, rub the cut garlic clove all over it for flavour, then spoon the mashed vegetables on top. Finely chop the parsley and scatter that on top.<br> Toss the salad and mint leaves in a bowl with a good pinch of salt, a splash of extra-virgin olive oil, a drizzle of balsamic and a squeeze of lemon juice. Put a pinch of the salad leaves on top of the bruschetta then shave over some Parmesan. Finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and serve right away with the rest of the salad on the side. For the vegetables:<br> If any of your carrots, parsnips or turnips are particularly big, chop them in 1/2. You can parboil the carrots, fennel, parsnips, and baby turnips together-everything except the beets, as they&#39;ll turn everything else red! The beets also take quite a bit longer to cook, around 20 to 25 minutes.<br> Put the rest of the vegetables into a large pot, cover with cold water and season well. Bring to the boil and cook for about 6 to 7 minutes until you&#39;ve got part-cooked, softened bendy vegetables, and then drain in a colander and leave to steam dry.<br> Get yourself a small tray, and use it to mix up each set of vegetables with their own gorgeous flavours, a few good lugs of oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the carrots, clementines and rosemary together first and move them to a larger roasting tray so they&#39;re all together.<br> Then mix your fennel with its flavours and do the same... When you get to the parsnips, keep the honey back for later. Make sure each vegetable group is separate in the roasting tray. Cover the tray with tin foil and keep in the refrigerator or the garage until your turkey is out of the oven and resting.<br> When you are ready to cook them, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F/ 190 degrees C/ Gas 5. Roast the vegetables in the hot oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour until they are golden, crispy and beautiful looking. Five minutes before they are ready to come out of the oven take the tray out, drizzle the honey over the parsnips and jiggle the tray so they are nicely coated.<br> Pile all the vegetables up on a platter so they sprawl and hang all over the place. That platter is like winter in a nutshell, and every single mouthful will taste different and exciting - you&#39;ll definitely want to keep it close to you at the table. For bruschetta: Put your bread slices onto a hot griddle and toast on both sides. Add the fennel to a bowl with the chopped basil leaves and most of the cl. Squeeze in the lemon juice, add a good drizzle extra-virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and a few shavings of Parmesan, then toss everything together. Have a quick taste to make sure the seasoning is right and add a bit more lemon juice or salt, if needed.<br> When the bread is nice and charred, rub the cut side of the garlic all over it. Drizzle with some extra-virgin olive oil then top with a small handful of your fennel mixture. Tear the mozzarella into quarters and place one on each bruschetta. Top with some thin shavings of Parmesan, a few little sprinkles of cl and the reserved basil. And just like that you&#39;ve got a lovely lunch. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 65054,&quot;Chicken Roulade Stuffed with Prosciutto, Spinach and Sun-Dried Tomatoes with White Truffle Potatoes 6 (6-ounce) boneless chicken breasts, skin on Salt Freshly ground black pepper 6 slices prosciutto ham 18 leaves fresh spinach 24 pieces sun-dried tomatoes 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/4 cup red wine 2 cups beef stock 1/4 cup tomato puree 1 cup demi-glace (brown sauce) 3 to 6 whole eggs, as needed 1 to 2 cups half-and-half, as needed 2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed 2 cups Italian flavored breadcrumbs, or as needed 1 liter canola oil 4 medium to large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks 1/2 bunch chives, chopped 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, plus 1 tablespoon for potatoes 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves White truffle oil, to taste (2 or 3 tablespoons) Instructions: Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. (Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet.) The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board, skin side down, with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you \\butterfly\\ them. To make the butterfly cut, carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. Pound chicken thin. Lay 1 slice of prosciutto ham on each breast. Add 3 leaves of spinach and 4 pieces of sun-dried tomatoes on each breast. Fold in each end and roll tightly. Place on sheet tray and freeze until firm. (It does not have to be frozen completely hard, but this makes it easier to handle when breading.) Preheat a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. While the chicken roulade is hardening in the freezer, prepare the tomato demi-glace. In a saucepan, saute garlic and then deglaze the pan with the wine. Add stock and tomato puree. Boil over medium heat until reduced by half. Add the demi-glace (brown sauce) and let simmer until thickened (\\medium thickness). When the chicken is firm, set up a breading station. Whisk together 3 eggs and 1 cup of the half-and-half for the egg wash. (Begin with this amount and whisk more together if needed.) Then set up a bowl each of: flour, then egg wash, and then Italian bread crumbs. Evenly coat rolled frozen chicken with flour (not too much or bread crumbs won&#39;t stick). Dip floured rolled chicken into egg wash, then into bread crumbs. In a deep-fat fryer, lightly fry until golden brown. Finish in the oven for 15 minutes until completely cooked through. Remove from oven and let rest. Boil the potatoes until tender. Then mash the potatoes and whip chopped chives, butter, salt and freshly ground pepper into the potatoes with a beater. Re-heat the tomato demi-glace and to finish remove from heat, and immediately whisk in fresh thyme and 1 tablespoon butter. Slice each chicken roll to expose the stuffed interior. Place mashed potatoes in center of each plate, drizzle white truffle oil over the potatoes. Lay chicken roulade over potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barolo]&quot; 65055,&quot;Smoked Turkey and Greens 24 smoked turkey legs Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 3 cloves garlic, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade and minced 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1 head cabbage, shredded in a food processor 1 pound collard greens, cleaned 1 pound fresh spinach, soaked in salt water to remove grit and dried in a salad spinner Salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Line an 8-inch square baking dish with aluminum foil or parchment, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the ends of the pan for lifting out the finished bars. Stir together the ground grahams, flour, sugar and salt in a small bowl. Cream the butter, egg and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until creamy and combined; you are not trying to beat a great amount of air into the mixture. Add the graham mixture and continue to beat on low speed until just combined and large crumbles form. Place about two-thirds of the mixture in the prepared pan and firmly press down. Reserve a few pieces of the chocolate for garnish (about 1/2-ounce), and then scatter the rest of the chocolate pieces over the base. Drop spoonfuls of the marshmallow creme over the chocolate, stretching the creme so it covers more of the base. Drop the remaining cookie batter in small clusters over the chocolate and creme so the creme is mostly covered. Bake until the dough is golden brown and the cookie in the center of the pan feels firm, about 40 minutes. The marshmallow creme will puff through the crumble and brown, and it will deflate as it cools. Cool in the pan at least 15 minutes. Using the foil overhang, lift the crumble bars out of the pan. Melt the reserved pieces of chocolate in the microwave in 30-second intervals until smooth, and then drizzle over the cookies. Cut into sixteen 2-by-2-inch squares.

Thoroughly combine all the ingredients. Cover the bowl and let rest for at least 1/2 an hour. Butter a ramekin to prevent sticking. Firmly pack some cous cous mixture in the ramekin and invert onto an individual dessert plate, so that the form of the cous cous is released from the ramekin. Sprinkle with icing sugar. Repeat for other individual plates and serve. For the dough: Cous cous is cooked in a special double boiler called a couscousiera. A makeshift couscousiera can be made by placing a colander over a similar-size pot and sealing the two together with simple dough to prevent steam from escaping. To make the dough: Combine 1 cup flour with enough water to create dough. Roll the dough into a long rope and use as a seal.<br> For the cous cous: Place half the durum wheat in a large bowl. Add splashes of water, salt, cinnamon, and extra-virgin olive oil, while stirring/raking the durum wheat in a circular motion with your hand. You should use approximately 1/2 the quantities of water, salt, cinnamon and extra-virgin olive oil at this point. Continue working in a circular motion, constantly stirring to moisten the grains evenly. Rub the mixture between your hands to remove any lumps that may form. If the mixture becomes too wet, add some more durum wheat, if it becomes too dry, add some more water. The mixture should form into small pellets. If you have not achieved small pellets, rub and rake some more.<br> Add the remaining durum wheat, salt, cinnamon and extra-virgin olive oil and repeat the process above. Transfer the cous cous to a colander and embed the zest of 1 lemon in the cous cous. Rest the colander over a pot of boiling water. Let the cous cous steam for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture into the meat as you work it with your hands. Press the meatloaf mixture into 4 mini loaf pans and sprinkle the top of each meatloaf with the BBQ spice rub. Move the loaf pans to a 6-inch-deep roasting pan fitted with a wire rack and lid. Cook in the smoker until the centers register 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes. Glaze the top of each meatloaf with the reserved BBQ sauce. Let sit for a few minutes before slicing. For the creme fraiche mashed potatoes: Add the potatoes to a pot and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and continue to cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash with the butter, creme fraiche and salt and pepper to taste. For the brown butter peas with shallots: In a saute pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over low heat. Add the shallots and cook until caramelized and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add some salt. Blanch the peas for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, then add them to the pan with the shallots. In a separate saucepan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter until browned. Add the sage, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper and stir to combine. Add the peas and shallots and toss to combine. For the red onion rings: Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a large pot until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Combine the flour, salt and some cayenne and paprika in a shallow bowl. Put the buttermilk in a separate shallow bowl. Dredge the onions first in the buttermilk, then in the flour mixture. Using a slotted spoon or any metal strainer, submerge the onions in the oil until they are a light golden brown color. Remove and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle on more salt if needed, and serve hot. Serve the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes, peas and red onion rings. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 65095,&quot;Not-Classic Wedge With Pickled Pepper Olive Relish and Blue Cheese 1 cup cider vinegar 1 tablespoon salt<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1/2 cup thinly sliced lipstick peppers (preferably in assorted colors; see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 8 ounces slab bacon, cut into lardons (about 1/2 cup)<br> 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese 1/2 cup pitted nicoise olives, chopped<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1 head iceberg lettuce, cut into four 1-inch rounds Instructions: Combine the vinegar, salt, sugar and peppers in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.

Fill a roasting pan about half full of water and place on the lower rack. This will create a moist environment for the cheesecake and help prevent cracking. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Put the graham crackers and 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar in the bowl of a food processor and grind until fine. Add the butter and two tablespoons of water and pulse until moistened. Press into the bottom of the prepared springform pan. Bake until set and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool completely. Combine the cream cheese, brown sugar, 1/3 cup granulated sugar and salt in a large bowl. Beat, with an electric mixer on medium speed, until smooth and fluffy. Add the yogurt, egg and egg whites, reduce the mixer speed to low, and continue to beat until blended. Add the pumpkin, flour, vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat until just combined. Stir with a spatula a few times to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated and to release any air bubbles in the batter that could cause the cheesecake to crack. Pour the batter over the crust and rap the pan against the countertop a few times to bring any trapped air bubbles to the surface. Place the cheesecake on the center rack in the oven. Bake until just set and the center wiggles slightly, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. Turn the oven off and crack the door open. Let sit in the oven for 15 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Run a thin sharp knife between the cheesecake and then pan to release the sides. Cool completely and then chill until cold, at least 4 hours, or overnight. Before serving, remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator and release the sides of the pan.

Let cool. Sift the flour, sugar, ginger, cinnamon and salt into a large bowl. Mix the melted butter into the flour mixture with an electric mixer until sandy. Add the corn syrup and vanilla, and mix until evenly incorporated, but still crumbly in texture. Press the dough together by hand and divide into 8 equal parts. Press into rough squares about 1 inch thick. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Place the dough on top of a flour-dusted sheet of parchment. Roll a square of dough about 1/4-inch thick and into an 8- by 11-inch rectangle. Repeat with all the remaining squares. Stack them up and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, click here to e-mail a link of the template to your desktop or laptop computer for printing. Print the file at 100% on letter size paper and cut out the pieces. Remove the top sheet of parchment from the dough. Lay the templates on the rolled dough slabs and cut out all the pieces with a long, sharp knife or pizza cutter. (You will have a total of 8 cut panels plus 3 extra sheets for cookies. Cut out the remaining dough with cookie cutters of your choice.) Cut a 3 1/2- by 3 1/2-inch square centered at the base of one of the tall walls then cut that piece in half to make the two barn doors. Stack panels on a cookie sheet and chill 45 minutes to set. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position the oven racks evenly. Bake the gingerbread shapes until they are a rich tawny brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack. With a fine kitchen rasp, file the panels to make all the edges straight. Thicken about 2 cups of the Royal Icing with either cornstarch and a couple of drops of vinegar, or extra confectioners&#39; sugar, to get the consistency of caulk. Fit a pastry bag with a medium round tip and fill it with the thickened icing. Pipe a generous amount of Royal Icing along the bottom and the sides of a short wall. Center the wall 3/4 inch from one edge, directly onto the base. Use a box or can to help support the walls while they dry. Pipe Royal Icing along the bottom of a tall wall, and stick it to the base with an edge pressed against the icing on the first wall. Repeat with the remaining two walls in the same manner until the four walls are up, making an open box with a 3/4-inch border all around the base. (The two tall walls will face each other.) Allow the icing to dry completely, about 24 hours, before attaching the roof. Ice the sloped edges on one side of the house and attach the big roof piece. (Line up the top of the roof with the peaks of the tall walls.) Use a box or can to prop up the overhang of the roof while it dries in place. Attach the smaller roof piece on the other side of the slope (prop it up with a box or can) leaving the same amount of overhang. Leave the top open for now. The last roof panel is the lid and will go there when all is dry. Attach the doors. Pipe Royal Icing neatly on the outside of the seams to secure them, and allow the house to dry for 24 hours. Fit tips into piping bags. Divide the remaining Royal Icing into batches and color as desired. Fill bags with frosting and decorate the house and roof with icing and candies if using. Allow to dry. Fill the house with cookies. Rest the remaining roof slab on the house to make a lid. Enjoy. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3/4cup water in a large bowl. Mix slowly with an electric mixer until stiff enough to form peaks; the icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is over beaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, and then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting. Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. Gels are best with royal icing. You don&#39;t want to thin them with liquid colors. Be careful of adding too much color, which reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days. Store the icing at room temperature, covered, with plastic wrap on the surface. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65114,&quot;Braised Short Rib Dumplings 2 pounds beef short ribs 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped<br> 1/2 yellow onion, diced<br> 1/2 cup red wine, such as pinot noir or cabernet sauvignon<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 1 cup low-sodium beef broth 1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon minced ginger<br> 3 garlic cloves, minced<br> 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce<br> 1/3 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 yellow onion, diced<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup frozen and thawed corn kernels<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 24 wonton wrappers<br> Vegetable oil for frying Instructions: For the short ribs: Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven.

Place 1 tablespoon of the corn puree on each wrapper and top with 1 tablespoon of the shredded short ribs. Moisten the edges of the wonton with water. Lift the corners of the wrapper and pinch them together. Continue with the remaining dumplings. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place half of the dumplings flat-side down in the oil and fry until the bottoms are golden brown, 2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water, cover the skillet and steam the dumplings until the wontons are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm while you cook the rest of the dumplings. Transfer all the dumplings to a platter and serve with the soy chili glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 65115,&quot;Momma&#39;s Slaw 2 to 3 pounds green cabbage, shredded 1/2 cup shredded carrots<br> 1 small or 1/2 large red onion, quartered and thinly sliced 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise 6 tablespoons buttermilk<br> 6 tablespoons Momma&#39;s Dry Rub, recipe follows, or your favorite barbecue rub (see Cook&#39;s Note) 6 tablespoons distilled white vinegar<br> 6 tablespoons buttermilk 2 tablespoons sugar<br> Kosher salt 1 pound brown sugar (light or dark) 3 ounces cornstarch 1 cup paprika 1 cup garlic salt<br> 1 cup seasoned salt<br> 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup chili powder 1/4 cup ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup ground white pepper<br> 2 teaspoons ground allspice<br> 2 teaspoons ground cayenne<br> 2 teaspoons ground cumin<br> 2 teaspoons mustard powder<br> Instructions: For the slaw: Combine the cabbage, carrots and red onions in a large bowl and toss gently.

Bake in the center of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the pastry is firm and golden brown all over. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the eggs together with the sugar until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is pale. Beat in the baking powder, lime zest, lime juice, and salt. Stir in the pistachio nuts. Pour this mixture over the prebaked crust, making sure that the pistachios are evenly distributed, and return to the oven for 20 to 25 minutes more, or until the filling is set and puffy. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool and refrigerate for at least 1 and preferably 2 hours, or overnight, tightly covered. Just before serving, sift a little confectioners sugar over the top and cut into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65121,&quot;Cole Slaw 1 bay leaf 1 cup red wine vinegar 3 tablespoons brown sugar 2 dashes hot pepper sauce 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon caraway seeds, toasted 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup vegetable oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 head red cabbage, thinly sliced 1/4 head green cabbage, thinly sliced 1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced Instructions: In a small saucepan, combine the bay leaf, vinegar, sugar, hot pepper sauce, and garlic, and bring to a boil.

Coat a 12-cavity donut pan with cooking spray and set aside. Whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl. Whisk together the egg, buttermilk, oil, vanilla and water in a medium bowl. Whisk the wet mixture into the dry mixture and stir to combine. Fill a piping bag with the batter and pipe the batter into the donut pans, filling each cavity halfway. This could get a little messy. Bake until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean, about 12 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Remove to a rack and cool completely. To decorate the donuts, dip them halfway into the glaze and then allow excess glaze to drip off. Sprinkle the tops with sprinkles and enjoy. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, honey and 4 tablespoons of the juice in a bowl. Add more juice little by little until the mixture is spreadable (you might not need the full remaining tablespoon). It should be quite thick yet spreadable. Put the rhubarb, granulated sugar and 1/2 cup water into a small pot on a stovetop. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the sugar is dissolved and the rhubarb is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Pour into a blender and puree until smooth, then transfer to a bowl. Add confectioners&#39; sugar as needed for taste and consistency. Put the blueberries, granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water into a small pot on a stovetop and cook over medium heat.

Add the yeast and stir until dissolved. Add the flour and use your hands to stir and knead gently until the dough just comes together and all the flour is incorporated, about 2 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.\\u202f\\u202f Lightly dust a work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough until a smooth ball forms, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled dough box or bowl and cover with a tightly fitting lid. Let rise until slightly puffy, about 1 hour.\\u202f\\u202f Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and divide it into eight 100-gram pieces. Form the pieces into compact balls and transfer to a lightly floured dough box or baking sheet; leave plenty of space between each ball for them to expand. Lightly flour the tops and cover the balls with a lid or plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until puffy, about 2 hours, then refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to overnight. For the pizzas: Two hours before cooking the pizzas, let the dough come to room temperature. Meanwhile combine the tomatoes, cilantro, garlic, chiles, seasoning packet, onion and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the tomatoes start to break down and soften, about 5 minutes. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring often, until everything is very soft, about 20 minutes more. Puree in a blender or with an immersion blender and set aside to cool (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Preheat a pizza oven to about 600 degrees F. (Because the egg on top takes a while to cook, the oven should be on the cooler side.) Lightly flour a pizza peel and stretch out a dough ball to about 8 inches in diameter. Sauce the round with 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce and dollop all over with 1 tablespoon of the beans. Tear 1 ounce of the Oaxacan cheese into small chunks and top the pizza with it, then sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the Cotija. Repeat with a second dough ball, stretching and topping it as above. Transfer the 2 rounds to the oven and cook, rotating them as necessary, until the crusts are set and lightly golden and the cheese has mostly melted, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and using the back of a spoon, make a well about 3 inches wide in the middle of each pizza. Crack an egg into each and return to the coolest part of the oven (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Cook, rotating as needed, until the egg whites are just set and the yolks are still runny, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for a minute; the eggs will continue to cook slightly. Top with the avocado and cilantro leaves. Serve with lime wedges and hot sauce. Repeat with the remaining pizzas. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 65129,&quot;Vegetable Dumplings 1/2 cup carrots, grated 1/2 cup scallions, minced 1/2 cup cabbage, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon ginger, minced 1/2 cup bean sprouts 1 egg white 1 package wonton wrappers Instructions: In large bowl combine carrots, scallions, cabbage, garlic and ginger.

I downloaded an image of a Mayan diety from the internet. A simple design with a lot of color makes the best result. Place your design underneath a piece of acetate. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to trace the outline of the painting with a dark-colored paint. Use other paint colors to fill in the design. This will certainly remind you of paint-by-number. Allow the paint to dry. Make a raplette: I created a homemade chocolate spreader by using poster board and an X-acto knife. Since my painting is 10 by 16-inches, the opening I will cut in the raplette is 10-inches wide by 1/8-inch high. Pour some white chocolate at the edge of the painted acetate. Pull the raplette through the chocolate pulling the chocolate over the painted drawing. This will spread an even 1/8-inch thick layer of chocolate over the painting. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to cut the paint canvas to the finished size of the painting. Let this cool until the chocolate sets. When the chocolate has set completely, simply peel off the acetate. Make the frame: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to cut 2 pieces of chocolate that are 16 inches long and 2 inches wide. Cut 2 more pieces that are 12 inches long by 2 inches wide. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Use a mitre box to trim all 4 ends to 90-degree angles. Just use a gentle sawing motion to cut through each piece. Make the cocoa pods: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many cocoa pods as you would like. Make the leaves: I found plastic leaves at the floral supply store. You can use real leaves if you make sure they are edible. Make sure they are clean and free of dust. Use a dry paintbrush to spread white chocolate on the face of the leaf. When the chocolate sets, peel off the plastic leaf. Now the leaves are ready to paint. I usually use green, yellow and red for leaves and always start with the lightest color first. If you want to paint the cocoa pods and the leaves, there are 2 methods. The first is to mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the inside of the mold, applying color where you are inspired to do so. Then, follow the instructions to make a mold. The second method is to use an airbrush. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired. Assembly: Use tempered chocolate to glue the frame pieces to the outside of the painting. Use more tempered chocolate to adhere the leaves to the frame and the cocoa pods to the leaves. Use vegetable oil to glaze the frame to make it shiny.

Bring the water, butter, salt, and sugar to a boil in a saucepan, over medium-high heat. Pull pan from the heat, add the flour at once and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until all the flour is incorporated, about 1 minute. Return the pan to the heat and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes to evaporate some of the water and \\cook\\ out the flour. The dough will get a bit shiny and stick to the pan a little. Transfer the mixture into an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix together on medium speed, and, while the mixer is running, add 1 egg. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Repeat, adding the other egg. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and eggs are uniformly incorporated. Using a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip, pipe the dough onto the baking sheet, into 1/4 to 1/2-inch balls. (Use a damp finger, to dab down the points of the dough to make perfect balls.) Sprinkle with the turbinado sugar, if desired. Bake 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F (without opening the oven door), and bake until puffed up, and a rich golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Remove and poke with a toothpick. Bake an additional 10 minutes to dry the insides of the puffs. Cool on a rack. Cut puffs in half and fill with Raspberry Cream, ice cream or your favorite filling. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. Mash the berries and sugar in a small saucepan with a wooden spoon. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently until the berries break down and get juicy, about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl; discard the seeds. Cool. Adjust the sweetness or tartness of the sauce with more sugar and lemon juice, as needed. Beat the cream until it holds a light peak. Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into the cream. Continue beating until the cream holds a holds a soft, but firm peak. Gently fold raspberry sauce into the whipped cream until blended.

Halve the tomatoes and place skin-side down on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt. Broil for 5 minutes, then add the garlic and jalapeno and broil until the vegetables are blistered and brown, another 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Put the tomatoes, garlic and jalapeno in a food processor and pulse a few times until combined but still chunky. Pour into a bowl and fold in the cilantro, lime juice and red onions. For the zucchini frita: Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Slice the zucchini on a diagonal into 1/2-inch slices. Brush with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Griddle the zucchini slices until lightly golden, about 2 minutes per side. Slit the Cuban buns and spread the butter on both sides. Place the buns buttered-side down on the griddle and cook until toasted. Spread about 2 ounces of the charred tomato salsa on the bottom of each bun, then layer with cooked zucchini, another 2 ounces of salsa and the potato sticks.

Slice off about 1/4 inch from the top of the garlic head. Place cut-side up on a piece of foil. Top with the olive oil and a pinch of salt; snap a rosemary sprig in half and place on top of the garlic. Wrap in the foil. Roast until the garlic is soft and golden, about 1 hour. Carefully open the foil and let the garlic cool slightly, then squeeze the cloves out of the skin; discard the rosemary. Meanwhile, butter a 2-quart baking dish. Smash the remaining 2 garlic cloves; add to a large pot along with the potatoes and the remaining 3 rosemary sprigs. Cover with cold water by 1 inch and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Drain well; discard the rosemary sprigs. Increase the oven temperature to 450?. Press the potatoes, boiled garlic and roasted garlic through a ricer or food mill back into the pot. (Alternatively, return the potatoes and boiled garlic to the pot along with the roasted garlic and mash with a potato masher.) Fold in the butter until melted. Gradually stir in 3/4 cup milk until smooth. If the potatoes still seem thick, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup milk as needed. Season with salt. Transfer the mashed potatoes to the prepared baking dish. Bake until browned on top, 30 to 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 65139,&quot;Susanna Foo&#39;s Pork Dumplings with Soy Ginger Sauce 1 pound pork butt, coarsely ground 1 cup finely chopped scallions 3 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil 1 tablespoon peeled, grated ginger root 1/2 pound Chinese napa cabbage, finely chopped 1 (1 pound) package round dumpling wrappers (gyoza), 3 inches in diameter 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon peeled, julienned ginger root, soaked in ice water Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the pork, scallions, soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger root. Mix well so that the flavors will penetrate the meat. Then add the cabbage and mix until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. The filling will not taste right if you try to combine all the ingredients at once. Place 1 dumpling wrapper on a plate or a board. (You can buy the wrappers in grocery stores or oriental specialty markets.) Place 1 scant tablespoon pork mixture in the center. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with a little water, then fold them over the filling to form a half moon shape. Pinch the center together first, then stand the dumpling up on its base and pleat one of the sides of the half moon twice, half way between the outer edge and the center. Pleat the other side in the same way and leave the dumpling standing up. Stand the finished dumplings on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper. Do not allow the sides of the dumplings to touch each other, or they will stick together. Repeat, using the remaining dumpling wrappers and pork filling. The dumplings can be made and frozen for up to 3 months or they may be cooked immediately, either boiled or pan fried. Serve hot. Tip: if you cannot get napa cabbage, substitute green cabbage. You will need to add 2 tablespoons of water to the pork filling before adding the cabbage, because green cabbage is not as moist as Chinese cabbage. To Pan Fry Dumplings: Heat 1 tablespoon corn oil in a large non-stick skillet. Add as many dumplings as can fit in a single layer. Pour 1/2 cup cold water over the dumplings. Cover the skillet and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, without turning or stirring, until the water has evaporated and the dumplings are golden and crisp on the bottom. If the dumplings are not browned enough, keep cooking until they are. Remove the dumplings to a heated platter and repeat with the remaining dumplings. Tip: Defrost frozen dumplings before cooking or they will burn. To Boil Dumplings: Fill a large stock pot 2/3 full of water and bring to a boil. Add 1/3 of the prepared dumplings. Using a Chinese strainer or slotted spoon, stir the dumplings to prevent them from sticking together. Return the water to a boil. The dumplings will rise to the top, but at this point the filling will still be raw. Add 1/2 cup cold water and return to a boil again. When the dumplings float, taste one to see if it&#39;s done. If not, add another 1/2 cup cold water and cook until the dumplings rise again. Adding cold water slows the cooking so the dough does not break, allowing enough time for the filling to be thoroughly cooked. Remove the dumplings from the pot using a Chinese strainer or slotted spoon and place them on a plate, being careful to keep them separate from one another. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Mix thoroughly and serve. This sauce will keep up to 1 week in the refrigerator, without the ginger root. Add the ginger root when ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 65140,&quot;Mini Chocolate-Meringue Cupcakes 2 large egg yolks, at room temperature 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2/3 cup sugar 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, melted 1/4 cup cake flour 3 large egg whites, at room temperature 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, melted 1 tablespoon vegetable oil Instructions: For the cupcakes: arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Refrigerate the egg yolks in a small bowl, covered, until ready to use. Pulse the flour, salt, mustard, paprika and turmeric in a food processor to combine. Add the pepper jack cheese spread, butter and Parmesan and pulse until the butter is completely broken up. Add the egg white mixture and pulse until the dough comes together in a ball. (It&#39;s okay if it&#39;s a little wet.) Put the dough on a large piece of plastic wrap, pat into a 1/2-inch-thick square and wrap in the plastic. Refrigerate to chill and firm up, about 1 hour. Cut the dough in half. Dust a sheet of parchment with flour and put one piece of the dough on top. Dust with more flour and top with another sheet of parchment. Roll out the dough into a square about 1/8 inch thick and chill until very firm, about 30 minutes. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough. Position oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. From one piece of rolled dough, measure and cut 6 panels for a box: two 4-inch squares for the top and bottom, two 4-by-2-inch rectangles for the long sides and two 3 1/2-by-2-inch rectangles for the slightly shorter sides. Arrange on one of the prepared baking sheets, cover and refrigerate until the dough firms up again, about 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough. Prick the dough panels with a fork (this will prevent the dough from rising too much during baking). Whisk 2 teaspoons water into the reserved egg yolks, then brush on the dough. Bake, rotating the baking sheets front to back and top to bottom about halfway through, until cooked through and golden brown around the edges, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. For the assembling and decorating: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat; fill a medium bowl with ice and water. Add the chives to the boiling water and cook until bright green and pliable, about 30 seconds. Transfer immediately to the ice water. Once completely cool, press between 2 paper towels to dry.<br> Add the pepper jack cheese spread to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until lightened and smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a medium plain tip. To build a box, put a 4-inch square panel flat-side up on a work surface and pipe the cheese glue around the perimeter. Push a long edge of a 4-by-2-inch side panel into the glue on any side (make sure the golden top is facing out). You can use a can to help prop the panel up. Push the other 4-by-2-inch side panel directly opposite of the first. Now do the same with the remaining 3 1/2-by-2-inch side panels. Pipe more cheese glue up the 4 corners to help the side panels adhere to one another. If any of the panels don&#39;t fit, use a sharp knife to trim the edges. Repeat to form a second box. Tie a chive bow on each of the remaining 4-inch square panels to make them look like the box tops of wrapped presents. These will be the lids. Pipe the remaining pepper jack cheese into the boxes, using a small offset spatula to smooth out the top, then top with the decorated lids.

Take your turkey out of the refrigerator about an hour before you&#39;re ready to cook it so it comes up to room temperature before roasting. Give it a good rinse then pat it dry with some kitchen paper, making sure you soak up any water in the cavity. Drizzle the meat with a good lug of olive oil, add a few good sprinkles of salt and pepper and then rub this seasoning all over the bird, making sure you get in to all the nooks and crannies. Preheat your oven to full whack then get started on your stuffing. For the stuffing: Pour a lug or 2 of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and fry off your chopped onion, for about 10 minutes, or until softened. Stir in a good pinch of salt and pepper, the ground nutmeg and your chopped sage leaves, then continue to fry and stir for another 1 minute or 2. Spoon the onion mixture into a large bowl and let it cool completely. Once cooled, add your pork mince and breadcrumbs and use your hands to really scrunch everything together. Once it&#39;s mixed really well, bring the stuffing together into a ball, then cover and chill until you&#39;re ready to stuff your turkey. Pull the skin at the neck-end back so you can see a cavity and push about 1/2 of your stuffing inside your turkey. Not too much: you don&#39;t want to pack it so tightly it slows down the cooking. Once done, pull and fold the skin over the opening and tuck it under the bird so it looks nice. Turn the turkey around and drop a few small pieces of stuffing into the larger cavity along with your clementine halves and a few sprigs rosemary. Place your roughly chopped onion, celery, and carrots in the bottom of a roasting pan and lay your turkey on top. Cover the turkey with tin foil then put it in the hot oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 350 degrees F/ 180 degrees C/ Gas 4. Cook for about 35 to 40 minutes per kilo/ 2 pounds 2 ounces. The 11 pound/ 5 kg bird in this recipe will take about 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Check on your turkey every 20 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan. After 2 1/2 hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. When the time is up, take your turkey out of the oven and stick a small sharp knife into the fattest part of the thigh. If the juices run clear and the meat pulls apart easily, it&#39;s ready. If not, pop the turkey back in the oven to cook for a bit longer, then check again. Once ready, cover the turkey with tin foil and a few clean tea towels for 30 minutes and let it rest while you get your vegetables and gravy ready. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65153,&quot;Crab Gravy 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) butter 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 cups diced celery<br> 1 1/2 cups chopped leek whites 1 1/2 cups diced onions<br> 1 tablespoon chopped garlic<br> 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> Pinch dried oregano<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 1 small bunch fresh parsley<br> 1 small bunch fresh thyme<br> 12 blue crabs, backs off and cleaned<br> 1 cup white wine<br> 1 gallon canned crushed plum tomatoes<br> Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay<br> 2 pounds linguine Instructions: Combine butter and oil in an 8- to 10-ounce stockpot over medium heat.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay the marshmallows on the foil, long side facing up (as opposed to standing up on the short end). Place under the broiler and cook until the marshmallows are golden brown and toasted, 10 to 15 seconds. Cool completely on the baking sheet. The marshmallows will firm up again in the center so you can skewer them. While the marshmallows cool, put the graham crackers in a resealable plastic bag and seal. Crush with a meat mallet, rolling pin or can until they are fine crumbs with a few small chunks. Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the crumbs and cook, stirring, until toasted and a few shades darker, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, pour onto a plate and cool completely. Once the marshmallows have cooled, skewer them and set aside. Finely chop the chocolate and reserve one-quarter of the chocolate separately. Put the rest in a heatproof bowl and set over a small pot with 2 inches of simmering water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Cook, stirring, until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the reserved chopped chocolate until melted. This technique will help the chocolate set hard without having grey streaks, called bloom, on your pops. Drizzle the skewered marshmallows with some melted chocolate and sprinkle with crumbs. Set the sticks into the open grids in a wire rack, so they stay upright, until the chocolate is set. Repeat with the remaining marshmallows, chocolate and crumbs. Fill a few tall glasses with marshmallows and set the finished pops, stick-side down, into the glasses for serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65158,&quot;Sam and Mary Scolaro&#39;s Stuffing 1 large stale loaf Italian/French bread 1 small stale loaf Italian/French bread<br> 2 boxes Nabisco Uneeda Biscuits 5 celery stalks chopped small (use inside tender stalks) 1/2 can walnuts chopped 1 cup raisins soaked in hot water to soften and then drain 2 cups of chopped Italian parsley 2 onions chopped fine 3 large eggs or 2 jumbo eggs Butter Salt and pepper Instructions: Soak bread for 15 minutes to soften.

Fill a large cast-iron skillet with 1 1/2 inches of oil and heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the steak strips with salt and pepper. In a shallow bowl, add the flour. In another shallow bowl, lightly beat the eggs. In another shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs. Lightly coat both sides of the steak in the flour, then in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs. Pan-fry the steaks, however many can fit at a time, until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the steaks from the oil and onto a baking sheet lined with a wire rack or paper towels. Season the fried steaks with salt and keep warm in the oven while you cook the rest, if need be. For the roasted red pepper sauce: Combine the almonds, Parmesan, oil, paprika, bell peppers, garlic and shallot in a food processor and blend until smooth, about 15 seconds. Season, and then place into a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes to take away the raw garlic bite and intensify the flavors. Set aside.

Add the prepared chicken pieces and leave for 15 minutes. Heat the peanut oil in a large shallow frying pan or casserole (that has a lid) over medium heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken pieces from the marinade to the pan. Saute them until they look cooked on the outside. Add the marinade to the chicken pieces and bring to a bubble, then turn down the heat to a gentle simmer, put the lid on and cook for about 5 minutes. Cut into a piece of chicken to make sure it&#39;s cooked through. Remove the cooked pieces with a slotted spoon (you could keep them in a bowl covered in aluminum foil to keep them warm) and turn the heat up under the pan to let the liquid boil down to a thick dark syrup. Return the chicken pieces back to the pan, stir well so that all the chicken pieces are coated in the sticky savory syrup. Serve with a comforting pile of sushi rice and perhaps some steamed baby bok choy or other veggies of your choice. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 65166,&quot;Peppermint Bonbons 14 ounces heavy cream 4 ounces sugar<br> 3 ounces sorbitol<br> 2 ounces inverted sugar<br> 1 ounce dextrose powder<br> 1 ounce peppermint extract 1 vanilla bean, split and seeded 5 tablespoons butter 7 ounces 65-percent dark chocolate<br> 7 ounces 38-percent milk chocolate<br> Instructions: In a large pot set over medium heat, add the cream, sugar, sorbitol, inverted sugar, dextrose, peppermint and vanilla seeds, and cook until a candy thermometer inserted in the pot reads 113 degrees F.

Toss 1/2 of the lamb cubes generously with salt and half of the flour. Add immediately to the hot oil and brown well on all sides. When the lamb is really brown on all sides, remove it from the pot and reserve. If the oil begins to smoke, lower the heat and continue. Repeat this process with the remaining lamb and flour. Put all the browned lamb on a plate.<br> Remove the excess oil from the pot, add a little fresh oil and heat it over medium-high heat. Add the onions and celery and season with salt. Cook until the onions start to soften and are very aromatic, about 7 to 8 minutes. Add the turnips, stir to combine and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Return the lamb to the pan and add the tomato puree, stout, marjoram, and bay leaves. Stir to combine, taste for seasoning and adjust, if needed. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat it to a simmer. Cover the pot halfway with a lid and simmer the stew for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, checking and stirring occasionally. Remove the lid during the last 15 to 20 minutes of the cooking time to allow the liquid to reduce and thicken. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed (it probably will).

Serve with bowls of olives, mixed peppers and cherry tomatoes, if using. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. Cook the squash: Place the squash halves cut-side up on the prepared sheet pan and brush with the olive oil. Place in the center rack of the oven. Add 1/2 cup water to the sheet pan to create steam and prevent overbrowning. Roast until tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour. Make the pickling liquid: In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, salt, cloves, cinnamon and 1 1/2 cups water. Cook on medium heat, stirring, until the sugar and salt dissolve. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Finish: Transfer the squash halves to a cutting board and set aside until cool enough to handle. Cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer to one or two glass jars with lids and pour the pickling liquid over the squash. Cover and let sit in the refrigerator overnight. Ideally, let it sit 2 to 3 days in the fridge and up to 1 week before serving. Cook the pasta: In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a rolling boil. Add a generous amount of salt. (The pasta water should taste like seawater.) Add the tortellini to the pot and stir so that it doesn\\u2019t stick to the bottom as it cooks. Cook until al dente, chewy but not hard or raw tasting, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain in a colander, reserving a little of the pasta cooking water in case you need it later. Make the parsley sauce: While the pasta is cooking, in the bowl of a food processor, add the flat leaf and curly parsley, garlic and a generous pinch of salt. Pulse to blend. Continue to pulse while slowly streaming in 1/3 cup oil through the top of the machine until almost completely smooth. (Do not overmix.) Add more oil if necessary to loosen the sauce. Transfer to a large serving bowl and stir in half the cheese. Taste for seasoning. Finish the dish: Drain any excess liquid from the tortellini and toss with the parsley sauce. Stir in more cheese if needed. Taste for seasoning. When ready to serve, squeeze a little of the lime juice lightly over the tortellini. Char the peppers: Place the peppers directly on the gas flame of the stove or grill. Char, turning occasionally, until the skin burns and turns black on all sides. Cover and refrigerate immediately to allow them to cool quickly, until the peppers are cool. Peel and discard the skin. I use a kitchen towel to wipe the skin away. Finish: Try to avoid rinsing the peppers, as it washes away flavor. Place on a flat surface. Open, seed and slice the peppers into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Arrange on a platter. Season with salt and drizzle with the vinegar and oil. Refrigerate. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 65210,&quot;Steak Frite with Skin-on-Fries and Roasted Garlic Butter 1 ounce balsamic vinegar 1/2 ounce olive oil Pinch kosher salt Pinch ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, plus 1 tablespoon 5 ounce sirloin steak, pounded into scallopini (can substitute round, London broil, or butt) 10 ounces skin-on french fries 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 4 tablespoons Roasted Garlic Butter, recipe follows 4 ounces butter, room temperature 1 ounce olive oil 2 tablespoons pureed roasted garlic 2 tablespoons chopped basil 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped parsley Instructions: Preheat a fryer to 360 degrees F.

Mix well and marinate in the refrigerator, overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove meat from marinade. In a large braising pot, over a moderately high heat, brown off meat in 2 tablespoons ghee or oil until golden brown on all sides. When done browning all of the meat, pour excess fat from pot. Add the rest of ghee or oil to pot and all of the reserved marinade and some hot sauce and saute for 6 minutes. Then, return meat to pot with enough water to just cover the meat and bring to a boil. Cover and put pot in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Add the potatoes to the pot, return the pot to the oven and cook for anther 1/2 hour, or until meat is tender. Remove the meat from the pot, place on a platter and cover with aluminum foil. Return the pan to the stove over medium heat and cook until sauce is thickened.

Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil in an 8-quart stovetop pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the lamb pieces and bones all over with salt and pepper. Working in batches (to not overcrowd the pot), sear the meat and bones in the hot oil until well browned on all sides. Remove from the pot and set aside. Pour off excess oil from the pot and then add the garlic, fennel, jalapenos, onions and red bell peppers. Sweat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato paste; cook for 2 minutes. Deglaze with the beef stock and balsamic vinegar. Add the seared lamb and bones back the pot, close the pressure cooker and cook on low heat until fork tender, 45 minutes. Remove the lamb from the braising liquid and pull into large chunks. Remove the bones from the pot, and discard. Strain the braising liquid and then add it back to the pot. Cook over medium heat until the liquid is reduced by half. Turn off the heat, add the lamb back to the pot and spoon the reduced liquid over the top to glaze.

Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs in batches, turning to brown all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. No need to cook them all the way as they&#39;ll go back into the soup later. Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside. Now, grab some beef stock and pour it into a pot. Add some salt and pepper. Stir in the tomato paste--it adds so much yummy richness. Make a bouquet garni by adding the peppercorns, bay leaves and remaining 1/4 cup parsley to a piece of cheesecloth and tying it into a bundle using kitchen twine; drop it right into the soup. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the bouquet garni, which now resembles a jellyfish with jaundice. Go ahead and discard it; it&#39;s lived a full life. Add the diced potatoes, carrots, celery and onions and the sliced cabbage. Finally, in go the browned meatballs. Let the soup simmer long enough for the vegetables to get slightly tender and the meatballs to cook all the way through, another 20 minutes or so. You can sprinkle the soup with some freshly grated Parmesan if you&#39;d like one last dose of decadence. Serve with crusty bread. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 65216,&quot;Warm Dijon Potato Salad with Green Beans 3 pounds Yukon or baby white potatoes 1 pound green beans, trimmed 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons whole grain Dijon mustard 1 shallot minced 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 30 grinds black pepper 1/3 cup packed finely chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water by at least a couple inches. Salt the water generously, bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Bring another pot of salted water to a boil and throw the beans in just for a minute or two until they turn bright green. Strain them and run them under cold water to stop the beans from cooking. In a mixing bowl combine the remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then into roughly 1 inch chunks. Cut beans in half. Toss the potato chunks in the dressing and then toss in the green beans and the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65217,&quot;Fried Cadbury Eggs 4 Cadbury Creme Eggs? 1 cup milk 1 large egg 1 tablespoon plus 4 cups canola oil 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 cups all-purpose flour A pinch kosher salt Instructions: Freeze the Cadbury Eggs for at least 2 hours up to overnight. Whisk together the milk, egg and 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl or measuring cup. Whisk together the baking powder, 1 cup of flour and salt in a medium bowl. Put the remaining 1 cup of flour in a small bowl.<br> Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and whisk until combined. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes while the oil heats. Attach a deep fat fry thermometer to a large heavy-bottomed pot (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add the 4 cups of oil and heat to 375 degrees F over medium-high heat. Using two forks (or your hands) dredge an egg in the flour, then coat in the batter, dredge in the flour again and then coat in the batter. (This double batter creates a thicker coating to keep the egg from leaking when fried.) Gently put it into the oil, turn it almost immediately with a slotted spoon, so that it does not stick to the bottom. Repeat with remaining eggs. Cook, turning frequently until the crust is a light golden, about 2 minutes. Remove the eggs to a paper towel-lined plate, let sit for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 65218,&quot;Ginger Lemongrass Pina Colada 1 stalk lemongrass 3/4 cup peeled and sliced fresh ginger 1/2 cup sugar Ice 2 cups pineapple juice, chilled 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup white rum, chilled Pinch kosher salt 4 fresh mint sprigs or 4-inch pieces lemongrass, for garnish Instructions: With the back of a heavy chef&#39;s knife, bruise the lemongrass stalk to expose the inside fibers and cut it into 1-inch lengths. Combine the lemongrass pieces, ginger, sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook a few minutes until the sugar dissolves.

Remove and chop fine. Saute the onions in the olive oil over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, until just starting to brown. Remove from the heat and wait 1 minute for the pan to start to cool. Add the chopped garlic, stir, and place mixture in a bowl to cool - never let the garlic hit the hot oil over the fire - this way the garlic will infuse the remaining moisture and not burn and get bitter. In a large stock pot over medium-low heat add the catsup and bring to a slow simmer, always stirring. After 10 minutes add the onions, garlic, soy sauce, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, yellow mustard, pickapeppa sauce, and wine vinegar, and let simmer for another 10 minutes, covered. Cut all the fruit into quarters and squeeze the juice into the pot. Then, add the fruit to the pot, with the brown sugar, horseradish, and Dr. Pepper. Continue to simmer for at least 40 minutes, covered. Add the dried cl peppers and cayenne, turn off heat and let the chiles go to work for about another 20 minutes. Chicken: Add all items to a very large pot of boiling water. Reduce heat, cover with a plate and simmer for 1 hour. Remove from the pot and let cool to room temperature, covered. Your grill should be very hot. We use a smoke box with wet wood chips in the gas grill to add a nice wood flavor (optional). Lightly spray the grill with nonstick spray. Add the chicken and get nice grill marks on both sides. The bbq sauce should be in a large pot that has just been removed from the heat. Very important: Just paint the chicken lightly with the sauce and let it stay on the grill for 1 minute on each side, just to burn the sauce. Remove from the grill and submerge in the hot bbq sauce for a just a second.

(To make ahead, after shaping the dough into balls, wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, then let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before rolling.) Working with a few balls at a time, roll each out into a thin round (about 1/8 inch thick), flouring the work surface and rolling pin as needed. Sprinkle a pizza peel or wooden cutting board with semolina or cornmeal, and put 1 or 2 pieces of rolled dough on top. Shake the peel back and forth to make sure the dough rounds are not sticking, then slide them onto the hot pizza stone and bake until they puff up and are just golden on the bottom but still soft and pliable, about 3 minutes. Remove the dough with tongs, press any bubbles down and let cool. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough. (The parbaked flatbreads can be topped and baked at this point or cooled, stacked, wrapped and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 months.) For the topping: While the flatbreads bake, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, and stir for 1 minute (add a splash of water if the mixture sticks). Add the remaining 4 tablespoons oil, the chicken, cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, cinnamon, red pepper flakes and allspice, and continue cooking, breaking up the meat, until cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the tomatoes, and cook for 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the yogurt, lemon juice and parsley . Let cool completely. (The topping can be made a day ahead and refrigerated.) For the sauce: Whisk together the yogurt, 3 tablespoons water and a large pinch of salt in a small bowl. To assemble, bake and serve: Brush each parbaked flatbread generously with oil, and top with about 1/4 cup of the topping. Bake them, 1 or 2 at a time, on the hot pizza stone until the bottoms are golden and crispy, about 5 minutes, rotating the flatbreads 180 degrees halfway through so they cook evenly. Drizzle the flatbreads with yogurt sauce, sprinkle with salt and parsley, cut into slices and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 65233,&quot;Garlic Tater Tots with Roasted Garlic A?oli 1 32-ounce bag frozen tater tots 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 head garlic, top trimmed to expose the cloves, plus 3 cloves minced<br> 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 cup mayonnaise Juice of 1 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450?

Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and salt and then combine the mixture with your hands. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the brown sugar, oil, and molasses on medium speed for 5 minutes. Turn the mixer to low speed, add the egg, and beat for 1 minute. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat for 1 more minute. With the mixer still on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add the crystallized ginger and mix until combined. Scoop the dough with 2 spoons or a small ice cream scoop. With your hands, roll each cookie into a 1 3/4-inch ball and then flatten them lightly with your fingers. Press both sides of each cookie in granulated sugar and place them on the sheet pans. Bake for exactly 13 minutes. The cookies will be crackled on the top and soft inside. Let the cookies cool on the sheets for 1 to 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65235,&quot;Chicken Fried Lamb Chops with Creamy Gravy 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cups whole milk Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon sugar (preferably turbinado sugar) Oil, for frying 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cups all-purpose flour 12 single-rib frenched lamb chops, 2 chops per person 2 cups buttermilk Instructions: For the gravy: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add flour and oil. Cook over medium heat for about 10 to 12 minutes whisking constantly until a peanut-brown color. Whisk in milk, salt, pepper, and sugar. Bring to a boil, continuing to whisk.

Add the chicken and refrigerate for 4 hours, turning every hour to distribute the marinade. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place, skin-side up, on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt on both sides. Roast until the juices run clear when the leg is pierced or the chicken reaches an internal temperature 165 degrees F, 25 to 30 minutes. Let rest at room temperature for about 45 minutes. Cut the chicken off the bone and dice into large bite-size pieces. Set aside. For the white sauce: Whisk together the yogurt, mayonnaise, parsley, lemon juice, vinegar, sugar and some salt in a bowl. Set aside. For the rice: Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the cumin and lightly toast, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes (do not let the butter brown). Add the rice and bay leaf, stirring to coat in the butter. Stir in the chicken broth, and season with salt. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Cover and cook for 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let sit, still covered, for another 10 minutes. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a small skillet. Stir in the turmeric and lightly toast to infuse the butter, about 1 minute. Stir the turmeric butter into the rice just before serving. Finish the chicken: Heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander, cumin, ginger and crushed red pepper, 1 teaspoon turmeric and 1 clove minced garlic, along with 1 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 3 minutes (turn down the heat if the garlic starts to brown). Add the reserved chicken to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt as necessary. With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a shallow bowl and keep warm. Keep the heat at medium. Slip the eggs into the same skillet and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still soft, 2 to 3 minutes. To serve: While the eggs are cooking, divide the rice among 4 plates. Spoon the chicken over the rice, top with a fried egg and a very generous drizzle of the white sauce. Serve immediately, with pita if using, tomatoes and lettuce for diners to add as they wish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 65237,&quot;Black and White Chocolate Mousse 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate 1/2 cup milk 1 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks 6 ounces white chocolate 1/2 cup creme fraiche 1 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks Milk chocolate, optional Instructions: Dark Mousse: In a bowl over barely simmering water, melt the bittersweet chocolate.

Place on a waxed paper lined sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Freeze for at least 2 hours. In a bowl, combine the cornflake crumbs with either the coconut, walnuts or cookie crumbs (or any combination). Spread the mixture in a shallow dish. Dip the ice cream balls in the crumb mixture and freeze for 30 minutes. In a bowl, beat the eggs and sugar. Dip the coated ice cream balls into the eggs, then roll in the crumb mixture, coating completely. Freeze for 1 hour. (If necessary, or for a thicker crust, roll again in eggs and crumbs until the balls are completely coated.) Heat the oil in a large pot or fryer to 400 degrees F. One at a time, lower the balls into the oil and fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the oil and place in a dessert bowl.

Peel the potatoes and cut them into slices, neither especially thin nor especially thick (approximately 1/2-inch) and put them into a large saucepan with the milk, cream, onion, minced garlic and salt. Bring to the boil and cook at a robust simmer or gentle boil (however you like to think of it) until verging on tender, but not dissolving into mush. The pan might be hell to clean afterward, but any excuse for long, lazy soaking rather than brisk pre-or postprandial scrubbing always appeals to me. And, for what it&#39;s worth, I find that when pans are really, dauntingly, stuck with cooked-on gunge, it&#39;s more effective to soak them in hot water and detergent (i.e., the stuff you put in the washing machine, though I haven&#39;t tried, and don&#39;t think I would, with tablets) rather than dish liquid. Use some of the butter to grease a large roasting pan (15 by 12-inches) and then pour the almost sludgy milk and potato mixture into it. Dot with remaining butter and cook in the oven for 15 minutes or until the potato is bubbly and browned on top. Remove, let stand for 10 to 20 minutes and then serve. This is not the most labor saving way of cooking potatoes, to be sure, but one of the most seductive. And it reheats well as an accompaniment to cold roast pork, or indeed anything in the days that follow. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 65245,&quot;Chili Mango Agua Fresca 3 ripe mangos, peeled, pitted and diced 3 sprigs fresh mint<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons honey<br> 1 tablespoon chili powder<br> 4 to 6 shots tequila, optional<br> Instructions: Add the mangoes, mint, honey, chili powder and 4 cups water to a blender.

Cook 1 minute, then add ground beef, tomato sauce, adobo, salt and olives. Mix well and let cook until brown, about 6 minutes. Set aside to cool. For the fritters: With a knife, cut the skin off the taro root and peel the bananas. Grate the taro root and bananas on the small holes of a box grater. Mix them with the annatto oil, adobo and salt in a bowl. Refrigerate for 1 hour, since the chilled dough is easier to assemble. (This is optional.) To assemble the fritters, use wax paper as your base. Cover the center with some annatto oil. Take a heaping 1/4 cup dough and set it in the center of the paper. Spread thinly, then add 3 tablespoons ground beef mixture to the center. Wrap both ends of the paper over each other to make a cylinder-shaped fritter. Push down on the dough to seal the meat inside the fritter. Make sure the dough is sealed completely on both ends and the center. If there are holes, seal them with extra dough, using your finger. Heat several inches of canola oil in a Dutch oven or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Slide the fritters into the hot oil for 5 to 6 minutes. Place them on a plate with a paper towel so the grease is absorbed. Serve immediately with hot sauce if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 65281,&quot;Roast Chicken with Potatoes and Vegetables 1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 sprigs fresh rosemary 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1 onion, cut in half 1/2 head garlic 1/2 lemon, cut in half Olive oil 6 small Yukon gold potatoes, cut in half 6 whole shallots, peeled 2 carrots, peeled and cut on the bias 2 heads escarole, rinsed, and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Rinse the chicken inside and out and pat dry.

Cover with plastic and set aside at room temperature for 12 hours or overnight. To make the dough: Whisk the all-purpose, whole wheat, and oat flour, flaxseed, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the poolish, water, and olive oil. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour with a wooden spoon to make a very sticky loose dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand for 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a well-floured work surface or prep mat. Coat your hands with flour and press dough into a 12 by 8-inch rectangle (long side towards you). Using a bench scraper, fold the dough as you would a business letter. (The dough is very wet and this may seem odd, but just move quickly with the scraper and fold 1 end of the dough over the other. Make sure you brush any raw flour from the surface of the dough before you fold over the second end). Spray with cooking spray and cover with a kitchen towel. Let stand 30 minutes. Fold the dough again like a letter, and rest for another 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Divide the olive oil among 2 pans and swirl to coat the pan. Divide dough in half and transfer a piece to each pan, turn dough over to coat both sides with oil, then press dough evenly into the pans. Scatter the garlic, thyme, and rosemary over the top and press the toppings into the dough with your fingers. Sprinkle with sea salt and scatter the cheese on top. (See Cook&#39;s Note.)

Line two 18-by-13-inch baking sheets with parchment. Add the egg whites to a CLEAN stand mixer bowl. Using the whisk attachment, whisk on high speed, adding the cream of tartar, salt and 6 to 8 generous drops of blue food coloring. Whisk until combined. Slowly add half the granulated sugar and continue to whisk on high until the meringue achieves medium-stiff peaks. Don&#39;t overmix so the meringue becomes \\dry.\\ Remove the meringue to a separate bowl; replace the mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and the remaining sugar to the new mixing bowl. Beat with the whisk attachment on high speed until light and doubled in volume. Add the water, oil, vanilla extract and almond extract and mix until well combined. Sift in the cake flour and mix on low until just combined. Increase the speed to high and mix for another 2 minutes. With a rubber spatula, gently fold in the egg whites. Divide the batter between the prepared baking sheets and spread evenly using a large offset spatula. Give the baking sheets a gentle tap on the countertop to fill any gaps and remove air pockets. Bake until the cakes spring back when gently poked, 20 to 25 minutes. Ten minutes into the bake, rotate the sheets for even baking. When the cakes come out of the oven, gently run a paring knife around their edges to release them from the baking sheets. Sprinkle both with confectioners&#39; sugar and top each with a clean kitchen towel. Place a second baking sheet on top of each cake and then flip the cakes over. Remove the parchment. While the cakes are still warm, roll them up in the towels, starting at the short ends. Let cool about 20 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, add the cream cheese and confectioners&#39; sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low to combine until smooth. Add the cream and vanilla extract and mix on low to combine. Increase the speed to high and whisk until stiff. Transfer a scant 1/2 cup of the filling to a small bowl. Fold in the strawberries and a drop of red food coloring. To assemble: Carefully unroll the cakes. Cut both cake sheets in half lengthwise. Spread the strawberry filling along the short edge of one strip of cake, covering about 2 to 3 inches. Spread the rest of the strip with plain filling. Cover the remaining 3 cake strips with plain filling. Start rolling the cake with the strawberry filling like a jellyroll, starting at the end with the strawberry filling. Once it&#39;s rolled up, move it over to the next strip of cake, lining it up with the edge. Continue rolling up the cake into an even bigger jellyroll. Continue with the remaining strips of cake. Wrap the cake in plastic wrap and transfer it to the freezer for 30 to 40 minutes to set. In the meantime, make the buttercream. For the Swiss meringue buttercream: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the egg whites, granulated sugar and salt. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn&#39;t touch the water, and whisk until the sugar is completely melted and the mixture reaches 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer the mixing bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk on high until the meringue holds stiff peaks and the bowl is cool to the touch. Add the vanilla and whisk to combine. Add the butter, a tablespoon at a time, counting to 10 between each addition. When the buttercream comes together, thickening and smoothing out into a spreadable consistency, continue whisking for 2 to 3 minutes more. (Makes 5 cups.) Place 1 1/2 cups buttercream in one bowl and add 2 drops blue food coloring; stir to combine. Add another 1 1/2 cups buttercream to a second bowl and add 2 drops of red food coloring; stir to combine. Leave the remaining buttercream plain. To finish the cake: Stand the cake vertically on a cake stand and remove the plastic wrap. Using a large offset spatula, spread an even layer of plain buttercream onto the top of the cake. Put the remaining plain buttercream, and the red and blue buttercream into separate pastry bags (or zip-top bags) and snip off about 1/4 inch from the tip. Pipe stripes of buttercream around the sides of the cake, alternating between the 3 colors. Use a hot bench scraper to smooth the sides of the cake (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65297,&quot;Mashed Potatoes with Buttermilk and Dill 2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4 medium), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed 1/4 cup low-fat milk 3/4 cup buttermilk 2 teaspoons finely chopped dill 1 teaspoon thinly sliced chives Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, and enough cold water to cover.

With clean dry beaters, beat the egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute, then increase the speed to medium high and gradually add the remaining 1/3 cup sugar; continue beating until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 more minutes. If the mixture gets too hot, remove the bowl from the pan. Gently fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture with a rubber spatula in four batches, sifting in the flour in alternating batches. It&#39;s OK if some streaks remain -- do not overmix. Remove 1/2 cup of the batter to a small bowl and whisk in the melted butter, then gently fold back into the batter. Divide the batter among the muffin cups. Bake until the centers spring back when pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan on a rack, then loosen with a paring knife and remove to the rack to cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, make the filling: Place a fine-mesh sieve in a medium bowl and set in a larger bowl of ice water. Whisk 1/4 cup milk, 2 tablespoons sugar, the egg yolks and cornstarch in a separate medium bowl until smooth. Heat 1 cup milk, 2 tablespoons sugar and the salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming, whisking to dissolve the sugar. Whisking constantly, gradually pour the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes, then continue whisking for 30 more seconds. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Immediately strain into the bowl set in the ice water and let cool, stirring occasionally, until lukewarm. Remove from the ice water, press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling and refrigerate until completely cooled. When ready to assemble the cakes, whisk in the lemon curd, limoncello and lemon juice. Whip the heavy cream in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form and fold into the filling.<br> Make the lemon syrup: Combine the water, sugar and lemon zest in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then remove from the heat. Stir in the limoncello. Let the syrup cool.<br> Fill the cakes: Trim the domed tops of the cakes to make them level (this will be the bottom). With a paring knife, cut a 1 1/2-inch-wide hole in the cakes; scoop out some of the inside to make a cavity, reserving the scraps. Brush the insides with some of the lemon syrup, then fill with the lemon filling, reserving the rest of the filling for the glaze. Close the hole with the cake scraps. Brush the cakes all over with the syrup until all the syrup is used.<br> Glaze the cakes: Place the cakes trimmed-side down on a rack set on a baking sheet. Whisk 5 to 6 tablespoons milk into the reserved lemon filling until pourable. Spoon over each cake to completely cover. Transfer to a platter and refrigerate, uncovered, at least 4 hours or overnight.<br> Garnish the cakes: Beat the heavy cream and sugar in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe around and on top of each cake. Top with candied lemon peel.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65327,&quot;Chicken and Wild Rice Casserole 3 cups cooked, chopped chicken breasts 1 package quick cooking wild rice, cooked according to package directions 1 package frozen French green beans, thawed and drained 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup chopped onion 3 tablespoons flour 1 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup cream or milk 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/4 cup slivered almonds Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Alternatively, preheat a grill. Next, pour the seasoning into a shallow pan and dip or roll the meat in it, making sure to completely cover all sides. Quickly sear the meat to seal in the flavorful juices and then raise the pit screen to prevent burning while slowly cooking the meat to your desired doneness. When the meat is finished cooking, remove it from the pit and let it rest 10 to 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Combine all ingredients in proportions according to your taste.

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add the allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon stick and orange zest and juice. Stir to combine and simmer until the cranberries fall apart, an additional 10 to 12 minutes. Strain the cranberries. Refrigerate the cranberries until chilled, at least 1 hour, then discard the cinnamon stick. (Save the strained cranberry liquid to use like a simple syrup in drinks or drizzled over the sliced strudel.) For the phyllo: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Spread the walnuts on one of the sheet pans and bake until golden brown and toasty, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then chop. Raise the oven to 375 degrees F. On a flat, clean surface, lay one sheet of phyllo flat with the long side closest to you. Brush lightly with the butter. Sprinkle with some of the sugar. Add another layer of phyllo and repeat with the butter and sugar. Do this 6 more times so you have 8 evenly stacked layers of buttered, sugared phyllo. (Make sure to save some butter for the outside of the rolled strudel.) Roll the strudel: Spread the cranberry mixture on the stack of phyllo, leaving about an inch border on all edges filling-free. Combine the walnuts, honey and a pinch of salt in a bowl and sprinkle in an even layer over the cranberries. Working from the long edge closest to you, roll the phyllo and filling up gently (but firmly) away from you, like a long newspaper. (It should look like a cranberry log!) Transfer to a lined sheet pan. Brush the strudel with the remaining butter. Place the strudel in the oven and bake until the exterior is golden brown and the filling is hot, about 30 minutes.

Place the tofu in a medium bowl. Add the black salt and turmeric and stir well with a fork, crumbling the tofu and fully combining the spices. Melt the vegan butter in a medium nonstick pan over medium-high heat, swirling the pan to coat evenly. Add the tofu mixture and spread it out evenly in the pan using a rubber spatula. Season with a pinch of kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook undisturbed until the edges begin to turn yellow from the turmeric and some moisture is bubbling up, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Gently stir the scramble, folding the cooked side over and redistributing the tofu to allow it to cook in an even layer. Continue to cook, stirring every 1 minute 30 seconds, until most of the moisture is evaporated and the tofu is the consistency of custardy scrambled eggs, 7 to 9 minutes. As it simmers, more liquid will bubble up and then it will dry out and the scramble will turn a uniform pale yellow color. Meanwhile, toast the bread.

Using a large rubber spatula, gently give the batter a few quick strokes to make sure there are no pockets of flour remaining. Fold in the blueberries. Fill each muffin cavity three-quarters full. For the crumble: In a large bowl, combine the flour, butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt using a wooden spoon or your fingers. Keep working the mixture until the butter is absorbed and the mixture starts to clump. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of the crumble on top of each muffin. Bake until the muffins just spring back when gently poked, 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65348,&quot;Roasted Chatham Cod Provencal Style 2 cups new potatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil<br> Four 5-ounce cod fillets (preferably Chatham cod), skin removed 1 medium bulb fennel, cored and julienned 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br> 1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped<br> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped<br> 1/4 cup pitted Nicoise olives<br> 2 tablespoons brined capers, drained<br> 15 canned whole, peeled San Marzano tomatoes<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with 1 inch of cold water, add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes until they are fork-tender, 5 to 8 minutes (depending on how big they are). Drain the potatoes and set aside until cool enough to handle; thinly slice the potatoes into rounds and set aside. Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the grapeseed oil and cod and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer the fish to a large plate and set aside. Arrange the fennel, garlic, potatoes, oregano, thyme, olives, capers and tomatoes in a medium broiler-proof casserole dish. Place the cod seared-side up and in the center of the dish and cover the cod with some of the vegetables. Drizzle with some olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Bake until the cod feels semi-firm to light pressure and the vegetables are caramelized, about 15 minutes. Heat the broiler to high and finish the fish under the broiler for 1 minute, until the crust is extra browned. Serve garnished with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65349,&quot;Calypso Beans, Tomato and Poblano Stew 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 3 garlic cloves, chopped 1 bay leaf 1 ham hock 1 pound dried calypso beans (or black-eyed peas), soaked overnight and drained 1 tablespoon ground cumin 3 canned chipotle peppers in adobe sauce 4 poblano chiles, roasted, seeded and chopped 4 tomatoes, seeded and chopped 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Lime wedges, for garnish Instructions: In a large pot over medium-high heat add olive oil.

Add the flour, then pulse until all of the liquid is absorbed and a large, soft dough ball forms (it&#39;s okay if there are some crumbles, the dough will come together when it&#39;s kneaded). Transfer the dough to a work surface dusted with flour and gently gather into a ball, sprinkling with flour as needed to avoid the dough sticking to your hands. Take care not to overwork the dough.<br> Dust a baking sheet with flour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Cover with plastic wrap. Dust the work surface with flour again and roll 1 piece of dough out to about 1/16-inch thick in a roughly 18- by 6- inch rectangle. Cut into 1/4-inch strips using a paring knife or pizza cutter. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with more flour to keep the noodles from sticking to each other. Cover with plastic wrap and roll out and cut the remaining dough. You can also use a pasta maker to roll out your dough and cut into noodles with the fettuccine attachment. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Whisk together the vinegar, sesame oil and ginger in a large bowl. Add the carrot and cabbage, toss to combine and let sit for a few minutes until the dressing becomes magenta.<br> Shake off the excess flour from the pasta, drop into the boiling water and cook until tender and no longer floury (it should rise to the top of the pot), 1 to 2 minutes.

Water should be warm but not hot to the touch. Stir in the yeast and allow to dissolve. Stir in 1 cup flour, stirring constantly in the same direction. Stir in another cup flour, then stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute). This helps develop the gluten. You now have a sponge. Cover, and let stand for half an hour or up to three hours. When you are ready to continue, sprinkle on salt and oil, then add more flour, stirring it in a half cup at a time. The dough will be getting heavier and harder to stir. When you can stir no longer, flour a kneading surface well and have more flour handy beside your work surface. Turn dough out and knead, adding extra flour to your work surface as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. The dough will gradually become smooth and easy to work. Knead for 10 minutes, clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, and place the ball of dough into the bowl to rise, covered with plastic wrap. Let rise until more than doubled, almost three hours. When the volume of the dough has approximately doubled, you can proceed to the next step.<br> Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored. If you wish postpone baking, gently push dough down, and leave covered in the bowl to rise again. If delay will be more than several hours, instead store dough in a plastic bag in the refrigerator (for not more than five days). Bring out of the cold and take out of the plastic bag at least an hour before you want to work with it.Lightly flour your work surface and lightly oil a 12 by 18-inch baking sheet. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Turn dough out onto work surface and flatten with the lightly floured palm of your hand. Pull and stretch the dough gently out into the rectangular shape you need to fit your baking sheet. Take your time and give the dough time to rest if it is resisting stretching. It will need to get quite thin. When you have stretched the dough to approximately the shape and size you need, transfer it to baking sheet and continue to gently press and stretch it to fit. Don&#39;t worry if it tears, just patch the hole with another piece of dough and press firmly to join the edges. If you have extra dough hanging over the edge, trim it off and use it to make another small pizza. Dough should be of an even thinness across the flat part of the baking sheet and should form a slight rounded rim as it meets the edge (which is for many people the best part of the pizza).<br> Brush top of pizza with oil, then dimple the surface all over with your fingers. Sprinkle garlic, sea salt and then optional rosemary leaves. Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and bake until the crust around the edge is slightly golden, 5 to 8 minutes, depending on how thin the pizza is. Remove from oven, brush crusts lightly with olive oil and also the center if you wish. Cut into large squares and serve warm or hot. We have often made pizza bianca several hours ahead, then wrapped it in a clean kitchen towel to keep it moist until we are ready to reheat it for serving. To reheat, place in a dampened paper bag in a 300 degree F oven for about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 65358,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Dip ? cup Buffalo wing sauce ? cup Mozzarella cheese, shredded ? cup Blue cheese, crumbled As needed Buffalo wing sauce 18 oz. bag Mission?

Set aside. For the pasta dough: Fit a stand mixer with the dough hook, then generously oil the hook to prevent dough from sticking. Whisk the egg, milk, salt and 1 tablespoon water together in a mixing bowl. Pour egg and milk mixture into the stand mixer bowl and add half the flour. Beat the dough over medium-low speed until the flour begins to incorporate into the mixture. Gradually add the rest of the flour until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Once the dough is mixed, turn out onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 2 portions. Using a pasta machine or pasta attachment for your stand mixer, sheet the dough: Begin with the machine on the thickest setting and run one of the dough pieces through. Gradually reduce the setting number until the dough has been sheeted through the lowest number. Scoop roughly 1/2-tablespoon dollops of filling on the pasta layer, leaving 1 inch of space from the edge of the pasta and in between each. Lightly sprinkle water over the pasta. This will help the top layer adhere. Using the same process as before, run the second portion of dough through the pasta machine, gradually thinning it to match the same thinness as the bottom layer. Carefully lay the top layer over the pasta and filling. Gently press the dough around the scoops of filling to seal the ravioli. Using a pasta cutter, cut the ravioli into 2-inch squares. Place cut ravioli on a parchment-lined sheet pan and cover. Freeze until completely solid, at least 3 hours. (Make sure your raviolis are fully frozen before breading, as the dough has a tendency to thaw quickly. If the raviolis are soft during breading, they can become misshapen.) For the breading: Whisk the eggs and milk together in a medium bowl. Add the cracker meal to a second medium bowl. Working in batches, dip ravioli into the egg and milk mixture, then toss into the cracker meal, coating well. Put breaded ravioli back on the lined sheet pan, cover and freeze for another 3 hours. Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pan halfway with canola oil and heat oil to 350 degrees F. Cook the ravioli in batches, being sure not to overcrowd the pan, and flipping during cooking, until golden brown all over, about 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 65360,&quot;Nana&#39;s Traditional Christmas Steamed Plum Pudding with Hard Sauce 1 cup light molasses 3/4 cup melted butter 1/2 cup warm milk 2 eggs, beaten 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus additional for tossing fruit 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1 pint candied mixed fruit (or diced dried fruit such as pineapple, pears, apples, and plums) 1 cup raisins 1 1/2 ounces brandy Holly sprig, for garnish Hard Sauce, recipe follows 1/4 pound butter 1 cup sugar 1 pinch salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-ounce brandy or rum Instructions: Combine the molasses, butter, milk, and eggs in a mixing bowl.

Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</p><p>Roll out half of the dough on a lightly-floured work surface into a large 1/8-inch-thick rectangle. Trim the sides with a knife so that you have a 9- by 8-inch rectangle with straight edges. Along the length, cut the rectangle into thirds so that you have three 3-inch strips. Then, cut the strips into fourths so that you have twelve small 3- by 2-inch rectangles in total. Carefully transfer these rectangles to one of your prepared baking sheets. Repeat this with the other half of dough. Gather the scraps of both halves and re-roll to create more rectangles (you will get 6 to 8 more).</p><p>Spoon a heaping teaspoon of strawberry filling in the center of half of the rectangles so that it is slightly heaped (do not spread it out).

With the flat beater attachment of an electric mixer, pastry blender or your fingertips, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle in 3 or 4 tablespoons of the eggy water and mix it in until the dough comes together in a ball. On a lightly floured surface, take walnut-sized pieces of dough and, with the heel of your hand, smear them away from you into 6-inch streaks. Pat the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat a 9 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom with nonstick vegetable spray. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into an 11 1/2-inch circle. Fit the dough into the pan. Trim the dough to a 1-inch overhang and double the dough over itself to reinforce the sides. Freeze for 30 minutes.

Melt 4 tablespoons of the fat in a large flameproof casserole. Add the onions and saute them over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Spread half of the sauerkraut over the onions, first squeezing it in your fists to extract all the water. Set the apple, both kinds of bacon, the smoked sausages, and smoked pork loin to top. Sprinkle with juniper berries and add seasoning, mainly pepper. Cover the meat with the rest of the sauerkraut, squeezing it dry also, and pour over the wine. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit inside the casserole and press it directly on top of the sauerkraut. Cover and simmer on top of the stove until the sauerkraut is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. About halfway through cooking, pour over the schnapps. Half an hour before the sauerkraut is cooked, put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water, cover and bring them to a boil. Simmer until tender when pierced with a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and keep them warm, peeling them just before serving. Heat 1 tablespoon fat in a frying pan and cook the cured pork chops until well done, 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Add them to the casserole 15 minutes before the sauerkraut is cooked. Warm the frankfurters in very hot water until heated through, about 1 minute. Leave them in the water to keep warm, draining them just before serving. To serve, taste the sauerkraut and adjust the seasoning. Lift out both kinds of bacon and the pork loin and carve them in generous slices. Drain the sauerkraut well and pile it on a large heated platter. Arrange the meats and sausages on top, with the potatoes around the edge. Pass mustard at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65367,&quot;Neely&#39;s Peach Iced Tea 8 bags English Breakfast Tea 1 bag hibiscus tea 8 cups water 1 (16-ounce) bag sliced frozen peaches, thawed, divided 1 (12-ounce) can peach nectar, chilled 1/4 cup peach liquor Fresh Mint, for garnish Instructions: Bring the water to a boil in a large pot.

Once mixture is thoroughly frozen, fluff with a fork and allow flakes to \\dry\\ in freezer another half hour before serving. When served, the granita should look like a fluffy pile of dry brown crystals. Scoop into goblets and top with barely sweetened whipped cream, add additional citrus zest if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 65397,&quot;Peter Paul Pancakes Recipe 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut, divided 1 cup chocolate in pieces or chips about 6 ounces 4-grain pancake batter, recipe follows Maple syrup 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 heaping tablespoons old-fashioned oats 2 heaping tablespoons toasted wheat germ 2 tablespoons coarse yellow cornmeal 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, or substitute soured milk 1/4 cup whole milk (or 2 percent, 1 percent, skim) 5 tablespoons melted butter, divided Instructions: Preheat griddle to medium or medium-high and oven to 350 degrees F. Toast 1/2 cup of the coconut by spreading it out on a cookie sheet and place in preheated oven for about 10 minutes or until golden brown. Shake or move the coconut around with tongs to get even toasting. Portion out the chocolate and coconut for 10 pancakes. (How chocolately or coconutty you want them to be is up to you - experiment, and don&#39;t get too picky about the portioning!) For the 4-grain pancake batter: Thoroughly mix all dry ingredients. Combine with the beaten eggs, buttermilk, and milk in a bowl, cutting together with a fork. Cut 4 tablespoons of the melted butter into the batter. Drizzle the remaining butter over the griddle and spoon on the batter. Immediately distribute the chocolate and untoasted coconut evenly over the surface. This is done quickly so they will sink into the batter. (Don&#39;t mix the chocolate into the batter beforehand!) Proceed to the next pancake, and so on. Go back and check your first pancake. The pancakes should cook about 2 minutes per side, but watch them. Remember my early admonition about not patting the pancakes with the spatula or turning them more than once. Top the finished Peter Pauls with some toasted coconut and serve with maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 65398,&quot;Beef Satay 2 1/2 pounds top round or London broil 1/2 cup light soy sauce 1/4 cup canola oil, plus more for grill 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon lime juice 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon brown sugar 2 teaspoons minced garlic 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger 4 scallions, thinly sliced Special equipment: 24 bamboo skewers, soaked in water 20 minutes Instructions: Slice the beef against the grain into 1/2-inch wide strips and place into a large resealable bag.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Puree in a blender and allow to cool. Place the sliced tenderloin and the butterflied shrimp in separate shallow dishes. Pour the puree over them, cover, and allow to marinate for 20 minutes.<br> Combine the chili paste, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and scallions. Place the short ribs meat side down on a cutting board. With a sharp knife slice between the bone and the meat but do not cut all the way through. Open like a book and carefully run the knife in the opposite direction to cut the meat in half, again not going all the way through. You should now have a long flat piece of meat, about the thickness of the bone. You can grill the short ribs in large pieces or cut the meat into smaller bite-sized pieces. Place the short ribs and lamb chops in separate shallow dishes and toss with the spicy marinade. Cover and marinate for 20 minutes.<br> Heat the grill, a grill pan, a cast iron skillet, or an electric tabletop grill. Grill the meats and shrimp until they are cooked to your liking. Serve as you cook them accompanied by a platter of mixed lettuce leaves, mint leaves, shiso or basil leaves, and sliced hot peppers, as well as small bowls of soy sauce and hot sauce. Also serve the Quick Spicy Kimchee, Sweet Pickled Daikon, and Cool Sesame Cucumbers in their own dishes.<br> Take a lettuce leaf in your hand. Put 1 or 2 pieces of meat or shrimp and top this with any combination of the condiments. Wrap the lettuce around the meat and eat out of hand. Remove outer leaves from cabbage. Cut cabbage in quarters and remove the tough inner core. Slice across sections into 1/2-inch slices. Put into a colander, add salt, and mix well. Place over a bowl and let drain, covered, until wilted, about 2 hours.<br> In a large bowl combine the vinegar and sugar and stir to dissolve. Add the chili paste, ginger, garlic, and scallions and stir. Rinse the salt off the cabbage with a couple of changes of water. Dry well and add to the vinegar mixture; stir well to combine. Put into a sterilized glass jar and pack the cabbage down; add enough water to cover. Close the jar and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. This is spicy and gets spicier the longer it sits - add or subtract chili paste to your taste.<br> In a small saucepan over medium heat add the vinegar, water, sugar, and turmeric. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat and allow it to cool. Meanwhile, peel the daikon radish and slice into 1/4-inch thick rounds. (If your daikon is very large, slice the rounds into semicircles.) Place in a colander with salt and mix well. Place the colander over a bowl and let drain for 1 hour. Rinse the salt off with a couple of changes of water and dry the daikon well. Put into a sterilized glass jar. Pour the cooled brine through a coffee filter (or a cheesecloth lined strainer) into the jar to cover the radish slices. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Will keep for about 2 weeks.<br> Slice the cucumber into thin rounds. Put them into a bowl and toss them with the soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, mint leaves and salt, to taste.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 65422,&quot;Sheet Pan Ratatouille Pizza 2 cups (240 grams) bread flour, plus more as needed 1 3/4 cups (180 grams) whole wheat flour<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar<br> One 1/4-ounce packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) instant dry yeast<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups (355 grams) warm water (90 to 110 degrees F, just warm to the touch)<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl<br> 2 small heads garlic, peeled (about 1/2 heaping cup cloves) 2 sprigs fresh rosemary plus 2 teaspoons chopped<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme plus 2 teaspoons chopped<br> 1 dried bay leaf<br> 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 plum tomatoes (12 ounces/340 grams), thinly sliced<br> 1 small Italian eggplant (8 ounces/225 grams), thinly sliced crosswise<br> 1 small orange bell pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips<br> 1 small yellow squash (6 ounces/170 grams), thinly sliced crosswise<br> 1 small zucchini (6 ounces/170 grams), thinly sliced crosswise<br> Kosher salt 1/2 cup prepared marinara or other smooth tomato sauce<br> One 8-ounce/225-gram burrata, drained well<br> 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly torn<br> 1 cup baby arugula<br> Freshly grated Parmesan, for sprinkling<br> Flaky salt, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: For the dough: Combine the bread flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, yeast and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix with the dough hook attachment to combine. Add the water and olive oil and mix on low speed just until the dough comes together. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix, adding just enough additional flour so that the dough no longer sticks to the bowl, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, 7 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, mix by hand and knead on a lightly floured surface.) Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn it once or twice to coat it in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until it has doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. For the garlic oil: Meanwhile, combine the garlic cloves, rosemary sprigs, thyme sprigs, bay leaf and oil in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over the lowest heat and cook until the cloves are light golden and completely tender, about 30 minutes. Let cool. Remove the herbs and stir in the red pepper flakes. For the pizza: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Punch the dough down. Brush a half-sheet pan with the olive oil (not the garlic oil) and pat out the dough to the edge. (This might seem like a lot of olive oil, but it&#39;ll make it good.) Set aside to rise, uncovered, for another 20 minutes or so. Combine the tomatoes, eggplant, bell pepper, squash and zucchini in a large colander. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and toss well. Let drain in the sink while the dough rises. Brush the dough with 2 tablespoons garlic oil and spread the marinara over the top in a very thin layer. Sprinkle with the chopped rosemary and thyme (reserved from making the garlic oil). Fish the garlic cloves from the oil and smooth and scatter them over the top. Pat the vegetables dry, then alternate the slices of the tomatoes, eggplant, bell pepper, yellow squash and zucchini over the sauce, shingling them in a pretty pattern. Tear the burrata in small shreds over the top. Drizzle with another tablespoon or two of the garlic oil. Bake the pizza on the bottom rack of the oven until the bottom crust is crisp and the top is golden, about 25 minutes. Scatter the basil and arugula over the top. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil and sprinkle with the Parmesan and flaky salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 65423,&quot;Strawberry Shortcake Cake 1/2 cup (1 stick) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened 1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 3 large eggs 1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 pound strawberries, hulled and halved 3 tablespoons granulated sugar One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter 1 1/2 pounds powdered sugar, sifted 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan that&#39;s at least 2 inches deep (or you can split the batter between 2 pans if they&#39;re not deep enough). To make the cake batter, beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the sour cream and vanilla, then mix until just combined. Sift together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda and add it to the bowl. Mix it together until just combined. Spread it in the pan or pans and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the cake is no longer jiggly like my bottom. Carefully remove the cake from the pan and allow it to cool completely. Next, mash the strawberries with a potato masher or a fork (reserve a few for garnish if you like). Sprinkle the strawberries with the sugar. Toss them around and allow them to sit for a little while. They&#39;ll give off this beautiful liquid after several minutes. Try not to drink it with a straw. To make the frosting, combine the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix until very light and fluffy. Warning: You&#39;ll feel like eating this bowl of icing before you even get it on the cake. To assemble the cake, use a sharp knife to cut it in half through the middle. It&#39;s easier if you go all around the perimeter of the cake, slicing only halfway through the circle the whole way. Lay the two halves cut side up. And cover both halves with an equal amount of strawberries. Then--this is an important step!--place the cake halves in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. This&#39;ll firm up the surface of the strawberries just a bit so that it&#39;s easier to spread on the icing. Remove the cakes from the freezer and place one layer on a cake stand or platter. Cover with a little less than a third of the icing. Place the second layer on top, then spread the top with icing. Carefully ice the outside of the cake with the remaining icing. Lovely! You can certainly decorate the top of the cake with strawberry slices, too. But I&#39;m hungry and want to eat, so I&#39;ll skip that part. Store leftovers in the fridge. The cake can be made up to 24 hours in advance. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 65424,&quot;Cherry Almond Crisp 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt Dash nutmeg 1 1/2 sticks cold butter 1/2 cup slivered almonds Four 12-ounce bags frozen tart cherries 1/4 cup cornstarch 2 teaspoons almond extract 2 cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons granulated sugar Vanilla ice cream, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Start with the crumb mixture. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Cut the cold butter into pieces. Add the butter to the bowl and use a fork or pastry blender to cut it into the flour mixture. The mixture should resemble a moist, coarse meal. Add the slivered almonds and combine thoroughly. Place the still-frozen cherries in a bowl, add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, cornstarch and almond extract and gently stir the cherries to combine. Divide the cherries between 8 ramekins (about 1/2 cup each). Top with the crumb mixture, evening out the surface. Bake until the topping is crisp and golden brown, about 45 minutes. If the topping appears underdone, continue baking in 10 minute increments until it&#39;s done. To serve: Add the heavy cream and granulated sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip. Keep in the fridge until ready to serve. Serve the individual crisps warm or at room temperature with a dollop of freshly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 65425,&quot;Lemon Parmesan Risotto Balls 5 cups vegetable stock 1 medium onion, finely diced 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 lemon, zested and juiced<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus 1/2 cup for garnish 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella 1 cup half-and-half 5 cups panko bread crumbs 4 cups vegetable oil Instructions: For the risotto: Heat the vegetable stock in a pot next to the risotto pot. Keep a ladle in it to use.<br> Saute the onion in the olive oil until wilted, add in the garlic and cook for another minute or so. Add in the Arborio rice and saute for a few minutes. Add in just enough stock to cover the rice and stir frequently.<br> As the rice absorbs the stock add the remainder of the stock and let the risotto cook through. (16 to 20 minutes). If it is not tender add some hot water until the risotto is tender.<br> When cooked through add in the lemon juice, lemon peel, Parmesan, mozzarella and half-and-half. Mix thoroughly. Let it cool for 1 hour or so.<br> To fry the balls: Heat the oil to 375 degrees F in a large pot. Place the panko bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Using a small spoon or small ice cream scooper form the risotto into 1-inch balls and roll them in the bread crumbs. Set aside until complete. Place a few balls in the hot oil at a time.

Stir in lemon juice, Worcestershire, salt and 4 quarts cold water. Remove giblets from turkey (if included) and trim excess skin. Submerge the turkey in the brine and refrigerate for 24 hours. If the turkey is not fully submerged, turn it every 8 hours. Remove the turkey from the brine, rinse well and pat dry. Discard the brine. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the remaining 4 cloves garlic, lemon zest, oregano, oil, pepper and 2 tablespoons water in a food processor and pulse until it becomes a paste. (Alternatively, chop garlic, lemon zest and oregano on a cutting board until finely minced, then place in a small bowl and stir in oil, pepper and water.) Loosen the skin over the breast and thigh meat. Rub the paste all over the turkey, under the skin onto the breast meat and leg meat and a little inside the cavity. Tuck the wing tips under the turkey. Tie the legs together with kitchen string. Place the turkey breast-side down in a roasting rack set in a large roasting pan. Roast the turkey for 1 hour. Turn it breast-side up on the rack, add 1 cup water to the pan, and continue roasting 1 hour more. Baste the turkey with pan drippings, tent with foil and continue roasting, basting every 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh without touching bone registers 165degreesF, 30 to 45 minutes more. Transfer the turkey to a large cutting board; let rest for 20 minutes before removing the string and carving. Meanwhile, pour any pan juices and fat into a large glass measuring cup and place in the freezer until the fat rises to the top, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, pour the pan juices and fat into a fat separator then pour the defatted juices into a large measuring cup.) Whisk flour with 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Set the roasting pan over two burners on medium heat. Add wine (or vermouth); bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Continue cooking until reduced, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan juices from the freezer, skim off the fat with a spoon and discard. Add the defatted juices and broth to the roasting pan; return to a simmer, whisking often. Cook for 1 minute, then whisk in the flour mixture and simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the gravy through a fine-mesh sieve and serve with the turkey.

Place the brown sugar in a pie dish. Gently press each slice of bacon into the sugar until coated (there can be small patches of uncoated bacon). Line a baking sheet with a wire rack and spray with cooking spray. Arrange the bacon on the rack. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through baking, until the bacon is super crisp and golden, 30 to 50 minutes (depending on the thickness of the bacon). Remove the rack from the pan and let the bacon cool on the rack. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place the vegetable oil and onions in the pan and gently cook, stirring only occasionally to let the sugars develop, until the onions are a deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. If necessary, deglaze the pan with red wine a couple of times. Season with the vinegar, salt and pepper and set aside. Combine the mayonnaise, barbecue rub and hot sauce in a small bowl to make an aioli. Build the sandwiches: Season the tomato slices with salt; cut the bacon slices in half. On each toasted bun, place a layer of caramelized onions, followed by about 6 half slices of bacon, a tomato slice, a romaine leaf and a nice schmear of the aioli on the bun top only. Close and serve with extra aioli on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 65428,&quot;Crispy Fingerling Potatoes 1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes Kosher salt 1/4 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon grill seasoning 2 teaspoons paprika Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the potatoes into a large pot and cover them with water. Add a big pinch of salt, then cover, and put over high heat. Bring to a boil, uncover, and cook just until the potatoes start to soften but are not cooked all the way through, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the warm pot. Shake the potatoes around to roughen up the sides and to let them dry out. Put them into a bowl. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put a baking sheet in the oven to preheat. Add the olive oil, grill seasoning, paprika and pepper, to taste, to the potatoes and toss to coat. Spread the potatoes out onto the preheated baking sheet and roast them until they are cooked through and crispy, about 20 to 25 minutes, flipping the potatoes once halfway through the cooking time.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Toss the squash with 2 tablespoons of the oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring once or twice, until golden brown and tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add both cans of tomatoes and 1 cup of water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat slightly, add the basil and simmer rapidly, uncovered, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the basil and season with salt and black pepper. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl with a slotted spoon. Cook the fusilli in the salted boiling water until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than the package directions. Drain the pasta and add it to the bowl. Add the tomato sauce, butternut squash, half of the mozzarella and half of the Parmesan to the bowl and stir well to combine. Transfer the pasta to a 3- to 4-quart baking dish and top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan. Bake, uncovered, until browned, about 15 minutes.

Placed in an airtight container, this rub will keep for about three months.<br> Pork Ribs: pare the grill: Place a drip pan filled with water in the barbecue - the ribs will cook above it. If using a gas grill, place the pan to one side and only light half of the burners. If using charcoal, get the coals hot and spread them out from the middle, creating a well for the drip pan to sit in. Rub pork spareribs with dry rub mixture. Note: It is not necessary to apply the dry rub hours beforehand; applying just before cooking yields the same results.<br> Check grill to see if it&#39;s reached the proper temperature, 200 degrees F. Place ribs on grill over drip pan, close barbecue lid and cook for about 1 1/2-2 hours at 200 degrees F. Turn ribs every 20-30 minutes, adding coals or adjusting gas to maintain a steady 200 degrees F. Some fluctuation is okay (and unavoidable if using charcoal), but the goal is to stay between 190 degrees F-220 degrees F.<br> Begin basting ribs with sauce in the final 10 minutes of grill time (after about 1 1/2 hours). Any earlier and the sauce will simply dry out. Once the ribs are cooked, wrap them tightly in aluminum foil and place inside paper bags. Set aside for 30 minutes to allow them to steam and tenderize the meat further without overcooking. Remove and serve with remaining sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 65436,&quot;Griddle Burger with 18000 Island Dressing and Quick Pickles 2 cups champagne vinegar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 cloves garlic, lightly smashed 1 bay leaf 1 English cucumber, cut into 1/8-inch slices 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill 1 cup mayo 1/4 cup ketchup 2 tablespoons sliced pickled jalapenos 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds ground chuck 8 ounces ground brisket 1 to 2 tablespoons canola oil 4 sesame seed buns 4 to 8 slices white American cheese Tomato slices, for serving Iceberg lettuce, for serving Instructions: For the quick pickles: Add the vinegar, 1/2 cup water, sugar, mustard seeds, salt, garlic and bay leaf to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Once the sugar has dissolved in the simmering liquid, add the cucumbers and dill to a heat-proof container and pour over the pickling liquid. Let sit for at least 10 minutes. Chop 2 tablespoons for the dressing, and reserve the rest for serving. For the 18000 island dressing: In a food processor add the mayonnaise, ketchup, jalapenos, chopped quick pickles, Dijon, garlic and some salt. Puree, taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. For the burgers: Heat a cast-iron skillet or large heavy griddle pan over medium-high heat. Combine the chuck and brisket and form into 4 balls with your hands. Add the canola oil to the heated griddle. Place the burger balls on the griddle and sear for 1 to 2 minutes per side. Then, using a spatula, press the balls down, flattening them down as you spread them out. You want a thin, crusty burger and that&#39;s all about creating surface area, so press away. Let the burger get a nice char on one side, and then flip so they get nice and crusty brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Butter and toast, or griddle, the sesame seed buns. Once toasted, add 1 to 2 slices cheese to each bottom bun. Place the burger on the bottom bun with the cheese. Top the burger with some tomato slices, quick pickles and iceberg lettuce. Spread some of the 18000 island dressing on the top bun and top the burger.

Lower a grilling grate so that it sits above the coals and you have nice, even medium heat. Wash the potatoes well in cold water, prick each all over with the tip of a knife and rub them all over with olive oil. Rub salt all over the potatoes; this will help crisp the skin. Tightly wrap each potato in aluminum foil. Place the potatoes on the grill grate over red coals (medium heat) and cook about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, turning halfway through. (Feed the fire with more wood as needed.) When done, the tip of a paring knife will go straight through the potato without resistance (you can do this through the foil). In a small bowl, combine the scallions, chopped herbs and sour cream. Set aside. Cut the potatoes open through the foil and peel back the foil to expose the potato. Squeeze the potatoes gently from the bottom to expose the soft, fluffy insides. Season with salt and pepper, top with butter and finish with a big spoonful of the herbed sour cream.

Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and rub with the olive oil. Bake until soft enough to yield to gentle pressure, about 1 hour. Let cool for 10 minutes. Heat the milk and butter in a small pot over low heat. Slice the potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh into a bowl, leaving just a little bit behind to give the skins some structure. Place the scooped-out potato skins back on the baking sheet and set aside. Mash the potatoes with a masher until there are no large clumps. Add the heated milk and butter as well as the Gruyere, sour cream, half of the chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix with a wooden spoon until well blended and smooth. Scoop the mashed potatoes back into the potato skins and top each with some of the Cheddar. Return the potatoes to the oven; bake for 20 minutes.

Whisk the granulated sugar and espresso powder in another bowl. Butter a 12-cup muffin pan. Divide the dough into 12 pieces; roll each piece into an 8-to-9-inch rope. Dip 1 piece of dough in the butter, letting the excess drip off, then roll in the espresso sugar. Tie the dough into a knot. Place in a muffin cup with one end of the knot facing up. Repeat with the remaining dough. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the knots until puffed and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pan. Meanwhile, make the glazes: Whisk 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar and the espresso powder in a medium bowl; add 1/4 cup heavy cream and whisk until smooth, adding more cream if necessary. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar with the remaining 2 tablespoons cream until smooth. Transfer the white glaze to a resealable plastic bag. Remove the knots from the pan and dip the tops in the espresso glaze; let set 5 minutes. Snip a small corner of the bag with the white glaze and pipe over the knots. Warm 1/2 cup water and the milk in a saucepan over low heat until a thermometer registers 100 degrees F to 110 degrees F. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast on top, then sprinkle with a pinch of the sugar; set aside, undisturbed, until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture until combined. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, the salt and nutmeg. Make a well in the center, then add the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon to make a thick and slightly sticky dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape into a ball. Brush a large bowl with butter. Add the dough, turning to coat lightly with the butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough is doubled in size, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and knead briefly to release excess air; re-form into a ball and return to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap and lay it directly on the surface of the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65442,&quot;Mushroom Enchiladas 1/2 cup olive oil, divided 1 pound shiitakes, chanterelles or portobellos (or a combination), sliced 1 small onion, finely chopped 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 tablespoon chopped oregano or 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 1 1/2 cups grated Jack cheese 8 corn tortillas 2 cups roasted vegetable sauce (recipe follows) 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

While the oil is heating, add the bacon to a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook until crispy and brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in a small bowl and set aside to cool. Place the onions in the buttermilk. Add the flour to a bowl or shallow baking dish. Scoop out a few onions at a time and dredge in the flour, shaking to remove any excess flour. Add to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes, then remove to a baking sheet with a wire rack and sprinkle with House Seasoning while still hot. Repeat with the remaining onions and set aside. Using your hands, mix the ground beef along with the cooled, reserved bacon fat and the garlic powder. Form the mixture into 4 loosely packed equal-sized patties with a slight dimple in the center to prevent them from doming. Place onto a baking sheet or large plate and sprinkle both sides of each patty generously with salt and pepper. Heat the skillet that was used to cook the bacon over medium heat. Add the burger patties, dimple side up, and cook on the first side, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip the patties and cook until the internal temperature of the burger is 135 to 140 degrees F for medium (the internal temperature will continue to rise when you remove the burger from heat to reach the ideal temperature of 145 degrees F), about 5 minutes more. Remove the patties from the skillet. Add the brioche buns to the same skillet and toast until lightly browned. To build the burgers, add one patty on top of a toasted brioche bun half. Drizzle over a couple tablespoons of the Blue Cheese Dressing. Top with a few fried onions, a slice of iceberg lettuce, another drizzle of Blue Cheese Dressing and two slices bacon. Top with the second half of the bun and place a cherry tomato on top, using a steak knife as a skewer to hold the burger together. Serve immediately. Stir together the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Keep in an airtight container for up to 6 months. Whisk together the buttermilk, sour cream, minced chives, garlic salt and black pepper in a small bowl until well combined. Stir in the blue cheese crumbles.

Combine the vegetable stock, salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and candied ginger in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve solids and bring to a boil. Then remove the brine from the heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. Early on the day or the night before you&#39;d like to eat: Combine the brine, water and ice in the 5-gallon bucket. Place the thawed turkey (with innards removed) breast side down in brine. If necessary, weigh down the bird to ensure it is fully immersed, cover, and refrigerate or set in cool area for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird once half way through brining. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Remove the bird from brine and rinse inside and out with cold water. Discard the brine. Place the bird on roasting rack inside a half sheet pan and pat dry with paper towels. Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and 1 cup of water in a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add steeped aromatics to the turkey&#39;s cavity along with the rosemary and sage. Tuck the wings underneath the bird and coat the skin liberally with canola oil. Roast the turkey on lowest level of the oven at 500 degrees F for 30 minutes. Insert a probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Set the thermometer alarm (if available) to 151 degrees F. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours of roasting.

Add the onion and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the pork, ground sirloin, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, salt and pepper and cook at medium heat until meat loses its pink color and is cooked through, about 7 minutes. Add the dried apples, apricots, and sweetened pineapple and remove from the heat. Add the ground cinnamon and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Set aside. Remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaf and discard. Sauce: Put the walnuts, Mexican crema and goat cheese in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth and silky, about 2 minutes. Sauce should coat the back of a spoon. (If the sauce is too thin, add more walnuts and puree. If too thick, add more cream.) Season with salt, to taste. Cut a lengthwise slit into each cl and carefully cut out seeds with kitchen shears, leaving the stem intact. (For less spice, carefully remove the veins.) Spoon the filling into the chiles, then close, slightly overlapping the sides of the openings. Transfer the stuffed chiles, seam sides up, to plates and pour about 1/3 cup the walnut sauce over each cl, leaving some of the cl visible. Sprinkle with parsley leaves and pomegranate seeds. Serve warm or at room temperature. *Cook&#39;s Note: To peel the walnuts: Cook in boiling water for 1 minute and drain. When cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to remove the skins. Peeling the walnuts before adding them to the sauce will make a smoother, whiter sauce. Unpeeled walnuts can be used, but the texture will be a little grainy and slightly bitter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 65452,&quot;Serrano Piquillo Manchego Panini 4 slices good quality ciabatta or sandwich bread 4 slices thinly sliced serrano ham, if not available use any good quality smoked ham 4 slices manchego cheese 4 piquillo peppers, roughly chopped, if not available use regular roasted peppers Instructions: Preheat your panini press or sandwich maker or nonstick skillet.

Once heated, add: ground beef, onions, rice and garlic and saute until the hamburger has browned. Remove from heat; stir in parsley, dill, salt, pepper and oregano. Set aside to cool a bit. Place grape leaves in a bowl and pour water over leaves. Soak for 15 minutes and drain. Transfer leaves, dull-side down, to paper towels to dry. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Stuff grape leaves using 1 heaping tablespoon mixture in center of the dull-side of the leaf and fold outer parts toward the center; and roll up like you would a burrito. Do not roll too tightly. Arrange rolls in side by side layers in a deep baking pan. Once complete, fill the pan with water to the top of the grape leaves and place the butter on top. Cover with foil and bake 1 hour or until the water has been absorbed by the grape leaves. To make the lemon sauce: In large pot bring chicken broth to a boil, reduce heat and add cornstarch slurry so it has a consistency of gravy. Have egg whites you have whipped up in a large bowl and add gravy to them slowly folding in. Be careful not to cook the whites, only temper them. Whip until you have a creamy consistency and add in lemon juice. For that lemony flavor may have to add more lemon juice to get the right lemon flavor. Plate up the grape leaves, and pour sauce on top. Should be off the hook. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 65459,&quot;Grilled Sweet Potatoes with Lime and Cilantro 3 sweet potatoes, unpeeled Kosher salt 2 teaspoons finely grated lime zest Pinch of cayenne pepper 1/4 cup canola oil Freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Parcook the potatoes: Place in a pot of water and boil until fork-tender; let cool. Slice each potato lengthwise into eighths. Preheat a grill to medium or place a cast-iron grill pan over medium heat. Mix 1 tablespoon salt, the lime zest and cayenne in a small bowl. Brush the potato wedges with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown on all sides (including the skin) and just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; immediately season with the salt mixture and sprinkle with cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o, Riesling]&quot; 65460,&quot;Buttermilk Nutmeg Drop Doughnuts 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 large egg white 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled Mild-flavored vegetable oil, for deep-frying 1 cup granulated sugar blended with 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, for rolling the hot fritters Instructions: Add vegetable oil to a large, heavy Dutch oven or deep-fryer to a depth of about 3 inches. Slowly heat the oil until it registers 365 to 375 degrees on a candy or deep-fry thermometer. Meanwhile, sift 1 cup of the flour and the salt, baking powder and baking soda into a large mixing bowl. Add the nutmeg and sugar and stir well with a wire whisk to thoroughly blend. Sift the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour into a small bowl and set aside. In a third bowl, lightly beat the egg and the egg white, then stir in the buttermilk and cooled melted butter. Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients all at once, then stir with a large looped whisk or a wooden spoon until the batter is almost smooth. Gradually beat in the remaining flour, stirring just enough to moisten the flour and smooth out most of the lumps. Do not overbeat the batter or it may become gluey and the fritters will be tough. Have a large plate lined with several layers of paper towel near the stove. Place the cinnamon sugar in a shallow bowl and have a second platter ready to hold the finished doughnuts. When the oil has reached the right temperature, gently drop spoonfuls of the batter about the size of a large egg into the hot oil in batches of three or four. Cooking more fritters at a time may cause the oil temperature to drop too severely. Keep an eye on the thermometer--the temperature will initially jump when the batter is added, then drop slightly. Try to keep it within 5 or 10 degrees of 365 by playing with the number of fritters in the pot. Too low a heat will cause the fritters to absorb too much oil, while too high a heat will burn the outsides before the insides are properly cooked. Fry the doughnuts for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, turning once or twice so they cook evenly. When they are a deep amber brown, transfer them to the paper towels with a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon. Let the fritters cool for a minute or so, then roll them in the cinnamon sugar and set them on the platter (or, as in my house, directly into somebody&#39;s open, waiting hand). Allow the temperature of the oil to recover before adding the next batch of doughnuts and repeat until all of the batter is used. Like most fritters, these doughnuts are best eaten as soon as they are fried, as they tend to get soggy and unappetizing with standing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65461,&quot;Easter Punch 25 ounces gin, such as Plymouth 20 ounces Acacia Honey Syrup, recipe follows 15 ounces freshly squeezed lime juice<br> 10 ounces velvet falernum<br> 10 ounces freshly squeezed grapefruit juice<br> 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> Rock candy sticks, for garnish<br> 2 cups acacia honey Instructions: Mix together the gin, Acacia Honey Syrup, lime juice, velvet falernum, grapefruit juice and nutmeg in a punch bowl.

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and reduce the heat to simmer until soft and plump, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, discard the cinnamon stick and rosemary sprigs. Strain the dried fruit mixture, reserving the infused chicken stock. Transfer the dried fruit mixture to a medium bowl and stir in the vinegar, sugar, walnuts and a pinch of salt. For the pork: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Slice the pork lengthwise, cutting to, but not through, the other side. Open the halves, laying the pork flat like a book. Place plastic wrap over the pork; pound to an even thickness, about 1/2 inch thick, using a meat mallet. Season the pork with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Spread the chutney mixture on the pork. Roll up, jelly-roll fashion. Truss the rolled pork with butcher&#39;s twine. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork, seam-side down; cook 4 minutes or until browned, carefully turning occasionally. If the pan gets too dark, deglaze with 1/4 cup chicken stock, discarding the stock in a heatproof bowl after the deglazing. Place the pan in the oven. Roast until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pork from the pan to a cutting board; let stand 5 minutes before slicing. Return the pan to medium-high heat and deglaze with 1 cup of the reserved infused chicken stock. Cook, stirring constantly, until the stock has reduced and thickened. Stir in the butter and season the sauce with salt and pepper, strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Drizzle around the pork. Serve with Garlic Rosemary Mashed Potatoes and Celery Salad. Put the potatoes in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Very generously salt the water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the potatoes are very soft, about 18 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine the heavy cream, garlic, rosemary, shallots and a pinch of salt. Simmer uncovered for about 15 minutes or until the cream reduces to 1/2 cup. Strain, set aside and keep warm. Drain the potatoes then put them through a food mill or ricer into a large bowl. Immediately stir in the butter and gradually pour in the warm cream. Stir until smooth. Season to taste with salt. Add all ingredients into a medium bowl; toss gently to coat.

Cut in the lard with a pastry blender or 2 knives until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then whisk in the stock. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and knead until a dough forms. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, for the empanada filling: In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and garlic salt and cook until the beef is cooked completely. Drain the grease and set the beef aside. In the same pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the tomato paste, vinegar, cumin, chili powder, oregano, seasoned salt, garlic, bell peppers and onions. Cook until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the beef and let them love each other with fire over low heat for about 5 more minutes. The mixture should be moist but not dripping wet. Now you are ready to fill the empanadas. Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out 4-, 5- or 6-inch rounds, depending on how large you prefer. Add some meat filling to each empanada and fold the dough over in half to enclose the filling. Use a fork to press and seal the edges closed. You can refrigerate the uncooked empanadas for up to 3 hours. Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F. Fry the empanadas until golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes.

Simmer gently for 1 hour over a low flame. Strain, transfer to a large container and reserve (cool completely if making ahead of time). For the minestrone: Add the oil to a Dutch oven and bring to medium heat. Sweat the carrots, celery and onions until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the potatoes, zucchini, cabbage and season with salt and pepper. Sweat the vegetables slowly until all are crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. Pour in the reserved stock and the tomatoes. Add the Parmesan rind and simmer 12 to 15 minutes; the vegetables should be tender. Remove from the heat. Add the navy beans and shredded chicken and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the minestrone into deep bowls and garnish with the shaved parmesan and chopped parsley and basil. Serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the chicken: Using kitchen shears, remove the backbone of the chicken and set aside. Cut the chicken in half, straight through the breastbone. By separating the chicken into two pieces it will ensure that the chicken gets smoked more thoroughly. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, the granulated garlic and smoked paprika. Place 1 deep aluminum roasting pan over the stove top. Line with aluminum foil. Add the soaked wood chips to a large piece of foil, and then fold in the sides to make a pouch.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the marinara sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook until reduced to a thick, jam-like consistency, about 30 minutes. There should be 1 1/2 to 2 cups of reduced sauce. Let the sauce cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Stir in the mozzarella cheese and prosciutto. Meanwhile, place 1 piece of dough on a work surface. Roll the dough out gently until you can cut an 8 1/2 by 9 1/2-inch rectangle. Press the scraps into a small rectangle and roll it out to the same thickness as the other rectangle. Cut 3 rectangles from the large rectangle and 1 rectangle from the small rectangle. Each should measure 8 1/2 by 3 inches. Continue rolling and cutting the remaining pie dough. To form the tarts, place the rectangles on a work surface. Brush each rectangle with egg wash. Place a large spoonful of the marinara mixture in the middle of the bottom half of the rectangle. Fold the dough in half over the marinara mixture to make a 3 by 4-inch rectangle. Press the edges to seal. Using a scalloped ravioli cutter, trim the rectangles to make a decorative edge. Place the tarts on the baking sheets.

Rinse the chicken and pat dry. If using 2 large breasts, then place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and halve them horizontally so you end up with 4 pieces of even thickness (if using chicken cutlets, skip this step). If the chicken pieces are thicker than 1/2 inch, place a large sheet of plastic wrap on a cutting board and set 1 piece of chicken on top. Cover with another sheet of plastic wrap and then pound the chicken to a 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or a heavy-bottomed pot. Season the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.<br> Add the chicken to the bowl with the mustard mixture and turn to coat. In a second medium bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, thyme, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.<br> Dredge each piece of chicken through the bread crumbs, gently pressing the crumbs into each side. Place a metal cooling rack on top of a baking sheet, and mist the rack with spray. Spray each piece of chicken on both sides and set it on the rack.

Slice potatoes and onions very thin. Salt potatoes and onions. Add oil and butter to the pan. When the butter foams, add potatoes and onions to the skillet. Place a dinner plate on top of potatoes and weight it with any heavy object: a sack of flour, heavy canned goods, etc. Let the potatoes and onions crust, 2 to 3 minutes, then turn, replace weights, and let them crust again. Keep turning the potatoes and onions over for about 20 minutes, until they are evenly golden and crusted. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65491,&quot;Almond Drops 1 cup (500 grams) almond paste, recipe follows 3 tablespoons (50 grams) corn syrup 3 tablespoons (50 grams) apricot puree 1 to 3 egg whites Whole blanched almonds, optional 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons (250 grams) sugar 1/4 cup (75 grams) honey 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons (100 grams) water 3 cups plus 3 tablespoons (500 grams) blanched, whole, almonds 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (50 grams) Kirsch or simple syrup, optional 1/4 cup (50 grams) butter Instructions: Place the almond paste, corn syrup and apricot puree in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle. Turn on the mixer to medium speed and add about 1 egg white, continue adding egg white gradually until the mixture can be piped through a piping bag. You will need to adjust the amount of egg whites added to the mixture depending on the consistency of the almond paste. Place the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe the mixture onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Use any design you like when you are piping the mixture. You can place whole almonds on top of some to achieve a different design. Preheat the oven to 380 degrees F and bake for 8 to10 minutes, until lightly golden brown. Place the sugar, honey and water in a saucepan and bring to a strong boil. Place the almonds in the food processor and grind until coarse. Remove the boiling sugar from the heat and pour over the coarse almonds. Blend until smooth. This may take 10 minutes or more, depending on the strength of the food processor. Remember, food processors are not usually strong enough to yield the same consistency as the almond paste that you can buy. If your mixture is too thick and the food processor is straining, you can add a little Kirsch or simple syrup to the processor. Add the liquid slowly and stop when the processor is moving more freely. The quality of almond paste is determined by how smooth the consistency is. Wrap the almond paste in plastic wrap and allow it to cool. When you are ready to use it, knead in the butter. The butter makes it smooth and not so sticky.

Mix together and then add the oil. Once combined, slowly add the water, a little at a time, and mix with your hands until a soft dough forms, (you may not need all of the water). Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth and bounces back when poked with a finger, about 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll out into 1/4-inch thick disks. Let rest while you make the orange honey syrup. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oranges with the syrup and toss to coat with the butter. When the butter starts to brown just a bit, remove the pan from the heat and add the orange liqueur and the remaining cinnamon. Pour the honey over the oranges and heat just until the honey starts to foam, about 3 minutes. Heat 2 inches of oil in a large cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F. Add the dough disks to the hot oil, in batches, until they are golden and have puffed up, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel to drain.

Season the pork shanks liberally with salt and pepper. In an oven-safe large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the blended oil over medium-high heat to nearly smoking. Sear the shanks on all sides until deeply caramelized and browned, about 10 minutes. Remove to a plate and reserve. Reduce the heat to medium and carefully remove any excess oil from the pot; only about 1 tablespoon is needed. Cook the carrots, onions, celery, garlic and anchovies over medium heat until the vegetables are translucent and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Stir in the rosemary, sage and thyme. Add the canned tomatoes and allow to cook until the tomatoes are a rust color (this draws the sweetness out of the tomatoes), 12 to 15 minutes. Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan, then reduce the heat and keep warm. Bring the wine to a boil in a small saucepan, then reduce the heat and keep warm. Return the shanks to the pot and nestle them at the bottom. Pour the chicken broth and wine over the shanks and vegetables. Cover with a lid and braise in the oven until fork-tender, about 4 hours. For the risotto: Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan, then reduce the heat and keep warm. Bring the wine to a boil in a saucepan, then reduce the heat and keep warm. Heat the oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a pot over medium heat until the butter melts. Add the onions and cook just until translucent; do not allow the onions to become golden. Using a wooden spoon, add the arborio rice and toast in the butter, oil and onions for a few minutes. Add the wine and allow the rice to soak it up and release its creamy starch into the pot. When the rice is nearly dry, add enough of the warm chicken broth to cover (about 3/4 cup) and cook, stirring, until the rice soaks it up. Repeat the process of adding broth and stirring as needed until the rice is tender and dry, 20 to 30 minutes. To finish the risotto, stir in a few pats of cold butter and the Parmigiano. Spoon the risotto into bowls, top with the osso buco and the braising liquid. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 65531,&quot;Rack of Lamb with Spring Potato and Cheese Gateau, English Pea Fricassee 1 (8 bone) rack of lamb, approximately 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds fully frenched 3 ounces olive oil 2 cloves of garlic, crushed with the flat end of a knife 2 ounces thyme 3 tablespoons butter 12 ounces lamb stock, reduced by 1/2 (lamb jus) 10 ounces yellow flesh spring potatoes, peeled 4 tablespoons butter, cold and cubed 1-ounce goat cheese, rolled into balls Salt and pepper 1-ounce bacon, diced 2 ounces pearl onions, sliced very thin 2 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper 5 ounces peas, shucked, blanched and peeled (approximately 1 pound in the pod) 1-ounce garlic puree (see recipe below Instructions: Cut the rack of lamb in 1/2, just to the right of the 4th bone.

Turn it on and drizzle in the olive oil until fully incorporated (emulsified). Marinate the chicken breasts overnight in this mixture. Preheat grill or grill pan on high. Remove chicken breasts from the marinade and transfer to a plate. Season them with salt and pepper. Mark the chicken breasts by grilling them only long enough to make grill marks and then rotating them about 45 degrees to make crosshatch marks. Do this on 1 side only. The chicken breasts should still be completely raw inside. Hold breasts in refrigerator until ready to stuff. For the stuffing: Peel, core, and very roughly chop the apples. Melt the butter in a saute pan over medium/high heat and add the apples. Cook the apples for roughly 5 to 10 minutes or until they are deeply browned. Remove from heat and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add the fontina and cherries and mix. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. For the chicken: Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.

It is the most creamy and tangy.) Instructions: For the pickled turnips: In a small saucepan on high heat, bring the vinegar, salt, mustard seeds, ras al hanout, bay leaves, garlic, beets, jalapeno if using and 2 cups water to a boil. Pour over the turnips in a heatproof bowl. Allow to cool to room temperature and refrigerate for 8 hours before using. They will last over a month in the fridge. For the pork belly: With a sharp paring knife, pierce the skin of the pork belly all over. Take care to go all the way through the skin, just into the fat, but not into the meat. The more perforations there are, the better the skin will crisp. Generously sprinkle both sides with salt. Place on a rack in a baking dish skin-side up, uncovered, overnight, in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (300 degrees F for convection ovens). Wipe off the salt and any juice with a paper towel. Place the pork belly skin-side up in a baking dish. Add 1/4-inch water on the sides (do not pour on the skin you attempted to dry). Bake for 1 hour. Add another 1/4-inch water and continue to bake for another hour. Repeat 1 more time, for a total cook time of about 3 hours. Turn the oven&#39;s broiler on high heat and broil the skin about 8 inches away from the heat source. The skin should puff up and crisp within 7 to 8 minutes. (Make sure to keep an eye on the skin while broiling in order to prevent it from burning.) Remove from the oven and cut into pieces about 1 1/2-inches long by 3/4-inch thick. For the tzatziki: In a small bowl, combine the yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, mint, lemon zest and juice and salt to taste. To assemble: Place 3 to 4 pieces pork belly on each pita, then top with arugula, turnip pickles and feta, and dollop with tzatziki. Wrap with parchment paper, then hand off and dig in. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65550,&quot;Almost Flourless Chocolate Cake 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Confectioners&#39; sugar, for garnish 1 pound fine quality bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 10 tablespoons butter 5 eggs Serving suggestions: sweetened whipped cream or crme anglaise Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Fill a very large wide-bottomed pot with water and add the vinegar, carrots, onion, celery, anise seed, fennel seed, coriander seed, bay leaf, and cayenne. Bring to a boil, submerge the lobsters (cook one at a time if they don&#39;t all fit) in the pot and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lobsters and immediately place in the ice bath to stop further cooking. Lay a lobster on a towel; pull the legs off and snap off the knuckles. Remove the thin part of the claws and the bone inside the claw meat by twisting and pulling it out. Lay the claw flat on a towel, cover, and gently pound with a wide mallet or heel of a knife. Use your fingers to gently push the meat through the large opening at the other end. Lay the tail meat flat and use shears to cut in half lengthwise through the middle. Remove the vein running through the inside of the tail but leave the meat inside the tail. For the knuckles, cut off the top joint of each knuckle and use scissors to cut away the shell along the smooth outside edge of the knuckle. Use your finger to open up the shell and remove the meat.

Bake until the pumpkin is very soft, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan, reserving the liquid in the pan. Scrape the flesh from the rind; discard the rind and the cinnamon stick. Blend the pumpkin with the remaining liquid in the pan, strain, and refrigerate until ready to use. Lay out a wonton wrapper, brush with the beaten egg, and place 1 teaspoon of muscade de Provence filling in the center of the wrapper. Cover with a second wrapper and press down the edges around the filling, making sure to push all air bubbles away from the center towards the outer edges. Press on the edges to seal. Use a cutter in order to shape the ravioli or trim the edges to the desired from. Dust with flour to prevent sticking, and chill until ready to use. To cook, blanch the ravioli in boiling water for 1 minute. To make the truffle butter sauce: Mix 1 1/2 cups of the beurre fondue with the truffle and veal stock, if using. To make the salad: In a bowl, mix together the frisee, celery root, microgreens, almonds, and apples. Toss with the vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. To serve: Immerse the lobster in the warm beurre fondue and leave for 2 minutes, off the heat, just long enough to warm up the lobster and finish the cooking. Put a spoonful of truffle butter sauce on the bottom of a plate to make a circle. Put the warm ravioli on top. Season with salt, pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Then set the lobster on the ravioli, pulled somewhat out of its shell.

Return a list of the wine types only. recipe: Baked Brie with Fig Jam and Honey 1 (1 lb) round of brie cheese 1/4 cup fig jam 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 1/4&quot; 65584,&quot;Strawberries and Cream Eclairs 80 grams (1/3 cup) water 80 grams (1/3 cup) whole milk 72 grams (5 tablespoons) unsalted butter 3 grams (3/4 teaspoon) superfine sugar 2.5 grams (1/2 teaspoon) salt 90 grams (3/4 cup) white bread flour 155 grams (5 1/2 ounces) beaten eggs (3 medium eggs)<br> 300 milliliters (1 1/4 cups) heavy cream 1 tablespoon superfine sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> Powdered sugar, to dust<br> 8 to 10 strawberries, sliced<br> Instructions: For the eclairs: Put the water, milk, butter, superfine sugar and salt into a saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil; this should take about a minute. As soon as it reaches a boil, add the flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it forms a glossy ball of dough, about 2 minutes. Put the ball of dough into a large bowl and allow it to cool for 2 minutes. Next, slowly add one-quarter of the beaten egg mixture and mix together with a wooden spoon until the mixture is homogeneous. Keep adding the egg a little at a time until the dough reaches the dropping stage--when you lift the wooden spoon out of the bowl, the mixture should fall off the spoon in 3 seconds. You may not need all of the egg, so be careful to add it slowly as to not make the mixture too runny. Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a French star tip nozzle (see Cook&#39;s Note). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper and pipe ten 5-inch lines of dough on it. Put the baking sheet in the freezer for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 205 degrees C/400 degrees F. Just before you add the eclairs, throw 2 tablespoons of water in the bottom of the oven to create some steam. Immediately place the eclairs in the oven and lower the temperature to 160 degrees C/320 degrees F. Bake until the eclairs are golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool. For the filling: Add the cream, superfine sugar and vanilla to a bowl and whisk until it reaches very soft peaks. Place the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a French star tip nozzle or other decorative tip. Assembly: Slice the cooled eclair shells in half lengthwise to make top and bottom shells. Dust the top shells lightly with powdered sugar. On the bottom shells, lay down some sliced strawberries, then pipe the whipped cream in a swirling motion on top. Place the top shells on the cream, then pipe more whipped cream on the tops in small dollops and decorate with more fresh strawberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 65585,&quot;Baked Apples with Bacon Streusel and Maple Cream 1/4 cup rolled oats 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 strip bacon, chopped 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 Macintosh apples, cored and halved 1/3 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup Fresh mint leaves, for garnish (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the oats, flour, sugar, cinnamon and bacon in a food processor and pulse until the bacon is finely chopped and the ingredients are well combined. Add the butter and pulse until incorporated and the topping starts to clump together. Mound clumps of the streusel on the cut-side of the apples and place in a small baking dish. Add about 1/2 inch water to the dish, and then bake until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown and crisp, about 45 minutes (loosely cover with foil if the topping is getting too brown before the apples are cooked). Whisk the cream and maple syrup together. Serve the apples with the maple cream and garnish with mint if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65586,&quot;Plantains, Sweet Potato and Asparagus Succotash 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large plantain 1 sweet potato, peeled and diced 1 bunch asparagus Chayote squash, sliced 4 tomotillos, chopped 1 tablespoon herb butter Instructions: Saute all ingredients in hot pan with olive oil for 6 to 8 minutes until sweet potatoes are tender.

Lay out 4 pieces of parchment paper, 16 inches long and the width of your roll. Toss the peppers, celery, leek and shallot with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Divide evenly and place on one half of each parchment piece. Toss the shrimp with the remaining tablespoon oil, the thyme, herbs de Provence and salt to taste. Divide evenly and put on top of the vegetables on the parchment. Put a lemon round on each and drizzle each with 1 teaspoon of wine or water. Fold the parchment paper over the ingredients, crimping and folding to seal, making parchment packages. Arrange the packages on a baking pan and bake until the shrimp are cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Cut a slit in each packet to release the steam, then open the packets. Drizzle each with olive oil and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 65588,&quot;Chocolate Cherry Icebox Cake 1 1/2 quarts heavy whipping cream 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/2 cup cocoa powder<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Two 9-ounce sleeves thin chocolate wafers (72 cookies)<br> One 16-ounce bag frozen dark sweet cherries 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons tart cherry juice<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> Instructions: Pour 3 cups whipping cream in the bowl of a stand mixer, then add 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar. Whip on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Scrape the whipped cream out of the bowl and set aside for cake assembly. Pour the remaining 3 cups whipping cream into the stand mixer bowl, then add the cocoa powder, vanilla extract and remaining 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar. Whip on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Set this chocolate whipped cream aside for cake assembly. Assemble the cake on a round serving platter or cake stand. Place 2 tablespoons of the plain whipped cream in the center of the platter. Spread it into a very thin layer, forming a 10-inch round to secure the first layer of wafers. Place 9 wafers, side by side, around the inner edge of whipped cream. Fill the center of the wafer circle with 3 more wafers (break 1 of the 3 wafers in half to fill the center neatly like a puzzle). Spread a third of the chocolate whipped cream (about 1 cup) in an even layer on top of the wafers using a small offset spatula. Be sure to push the whipped cream almost to the edge of the wafers, leaving just a bit of the wafers exposed. Repeating the same pattern, make another wafer layer with 12 wafers. Next, place a third of the whipped cream (about 1 cup) on top of the wafers in an even layer. Top the whipped cream with another layer of wafers. Repeat this process to create 4 more layers, alternating between the plain whipped cream and chocolate whipped cream, each separated by a layer of 12 wafers. Place the cake into the refrigerator to set up 8 hours or up to overnight. For the cherry sauce: Meanwhile, combine the frozen cherries, granulated sugar, honey, salt, lemon juice and 1/2 cup tart cherry juice in a medium saucepot. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and the cherries soften, about 8 minutes. Whisk the cornstarch with the remaining 1 to 2 tablespoons of tart cherry juice in a small mixing bowl to create a slurry. Drizzle the slurry into the cherry mixture, stirring constantly, then cook at a low simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce develops a smooth velvety texture, 2 to 3 minutes. Put the sauce in the refrigerator to cool until the icebox cake is ready to serve. Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Top with the cold cherry sauce and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel]&quot; 65589,&quot;Shoofly Pie One 9-inch store-bought frozen pie crust dough, defrosted 3/4 cup unsulphured molasses 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1 egg, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 cup hot water 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces Sweetened whipped cream or ice cream, for serving, optional Instructions: For the pie: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
