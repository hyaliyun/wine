Allow to soak overnight in the refrigerator. Drain the beans and place them in a large pot with 8 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and continue to simmer for about 15 minutes, until the beans are tender. Set the beans aside to cool in their liquid. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large stockpot. Add the pancetta and onions and cook over medium-low heat for 7 to 10 minutes, until the onions are translucent. Add the carrots, celery, garlic, 1 tablespoon of salt, the pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium-low heat for 7 to 10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Add the tomatoes with their puree, the cabbage, if using, the kale, and basil and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for another 7 to 10 minutes. Drain the beans, reserving their cooking liquid. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, puree half of the beans with a little of their liquid. Add to the stockpot, along with the remaining whole beans. Pour the bean cooking liquid into a large measuring cup and add enough chicken stock to make 8 cups. Add to the soup and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Add the bread to the soup and simmer for 10 more minutes.

Put the tails into a large pot of boiling water and parboil for about 5 to 7 minutes. (We only want to cook them 3/4 of the way through, because the lobster tails will finish cooking on the grill.) Once parboiled, remove the skewers. Using kitchen shears, cut lengthwise down the underside shell of the tail to remove the meat. Discard the shells. Wrap the lobster tails crosswise with slices of pancetta. Tip: When wrapping the lobster meat in pancetta, wrap tightly and squeeze to make it stick. The fat from the pancetta acts as a glue. Once wrapped, put the lobster tail on the LOWEST HEAT of the grill. Remove the lobster tails from the grill to a serving platter. Mango Salad: Dice the avocado, mango, and jicama and add them to a serving bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, then stir in a little olive oil, the lime juice and the mint. Keep chilled until ready to serve. Summer Salad: Grill the jalapeno and green onions for 2 to 3 minutes, and the corn for 5 to 7 minutes on the HOTTEST HEAT of the grill. Remove the vegetables from the grill to a cutting board. Slice the green onion, cut the corn off the cob, and dice the jalapeno pepper and add them to a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Melt the butter in a cast iron pan and stir in the seasoned vegetables. Keep the vegetables warm on the grill. When ready to serve transfer the vegetables to a serving bowl. Serve the lobster with the Mango Salad and Summer Salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 69939,&quot;Butternut Squash and Sausage Lasagna 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 pounds sweet Italian sausage (if links, casings removed)<br> 1 large yellow onion, diced<br> 8 ounces white button mushrooms, chopped<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> Pinch of crushed red pepper<br> Two 15-ounce cans butternut squash puree<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 1/2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese 1 cup finely grated Parmesan 1 cup chopped cooked kale (use a kitchen towel to squeeze out any excess moisture from the kale)<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh sage<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br> Pinch of ground nutmeg<br> Sea salt 1 pound lasagna noodles Olive oil, for drizzling Nonstick cooking spray, for the casserole dish 4 cups shredded mozzarella<br> 1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan Instructions: For the sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and use a wooden spoon to break up the meat as it browns. When the sausage has cooked to golden brown, about 8 minutes, transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Return the skillet to medium heat and add the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Add the onions and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits left on the bottom of the skillet. Deglaze with 2 tablespoons water. Cook until the onions are translucent, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper and cook about 2 minutes. Add the sausage back to the skillet. Stir in the canned butternut squash, cream, salt and pepper. Set aside. For the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, kale, sage, garlic powder, salt, pepper, eggs and nutmeg. Stir to combine and set aside. For the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles in the boiling water for half the time the package recommends. Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent them from sticking together. Spray a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon about a cup of the sauce into the dish, spreading it to cover the bottom. Arrange half the lasagna noodles over the sauce, then begin layering first with half of the ricotta filling, then half of the sauce, then half of the mozzarella. Continue layering with the remaining noodles, filling and sauce, finishing with mozzarella on top. Sprinkle with the Parmesan. Tap the casserole on the counter to force out any air bubbles. Bake until the cheese is golden brown and the lasagna is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes. Let it rest for 15 minutes so it can set and be cut easily. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 69940,&quot;Frittata 8 extra-large eggs 2 tablespoons whole milk Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon butter 1 small onion, diced 4 small red potatoes, diced 1 cup diced Canadian bacon 1/4 cup sour cream 1/4 cup prepared salsa 1 bunch chives, chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

After the dough has taken its first rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (or overnight) it can be shaped into a fougasse. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a long narrow rectangle. Sprinkle a layer of chopped rosemary over the surface of the dough being careful to cover the edges too. Fold the dough in thirds like a business letter, the top third over the middle of the dough, then the bottom third over that, completely overlapping the two. Press the 3 open sides of the fougasse tightly shut. Cover the bread well with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone. Sprinkle a peel or upsidedown baking sheet generously with cornmeal and place the fougasse on top, stretching it slightly to make it into a square. Cut a decorative pattern, such as a leaf or a ladder, into the dough with a dough cutter. Spread and stretch the loaf until the cuts form large openings. Be sure the fougasse is loosened from the peel, then carefully slide it onto the baking stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the bread with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later. Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaf sounds slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not brown enough, the bread will soften as it cools.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 69945,&quot;Spinach Salad with Pomegranate Dressing and Crispy Won Ton \\Croutons<br> 1/3 cup fresh orange juice 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon black pepper Croutons, recipe follows 12 cups torn spinach (about 6 ounces) 1 cup thinly sliced red onion Two 11-ounce cans mandarin oranges in light syrup, drained 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon salt 12 ounces won ton wrappers, cut into 1/4-inch strips 2 teaspoons vegetable oil Instructions: To prepare salad, combine juice, molasses, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk.

For the Broth: Put the rest of the 2 chickens into a large pot. Cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat, but do not let it boil. Skim off any fat and scum that rises to the surface. Once the water is simmering add the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and white wine. Simmer slowly for 3 to 4 hours. Remove the chicken from the pot, set it aside to cool, cover, and refrigerate it. Strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer and refrigerate until ready for use. The broth can also be frozen. For the Poached Breasts: Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Place each breast into a small resealable plastic bag. Divide the butter, thyme, wine, garlic, and chicken broth evenly into the bags. Press out all of the air and seal the bags tightly. Keep refrigerated until ready to cook. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and bring it to a simmer. Add the bags to the water and submerge them; don&#39;t let the plastic catch the rim of the pan or they will melt.

Blend on high until completely smooth, then allow the batter to rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a 12-cup muffin tin in the oven over a baking sheet and allow the pan to preheat while the oven is preheating. After 20 minutes, remove the muffin tin from the oven and evenly pour the fat amongst the 12 cups (about 1 teaspoon of fat in each cup). Place the muffin tin back in the oven for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the fat to heat up. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully fill each cup a third of the way with the batter. Immediately place the baking sheet back in the oven and bake until golden brown and puffed, about 15 minutes.

Cover with about 3 quarts of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the pork is tender, about 1 hour. Let cool in the liquid to room temperature. This allows the pork to stay moist and absorb more flavor. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and pat dry. Set a grill for indirect cooking and heat to medium-high, about 400 degrees F. Place the pork skin-side down over the indirect heat portion of the grill. Close the lid and cook, until some of the fat is rendered and the skin is starting to crisp, about 20 minutes (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Move the pork to the direct heat portion of the grill. Continue to cook until slightly charred and the skin is crisp, moving the pork when flare-ups occur, 15 to 20 minutes.<br> Skewer the chicken livers if using. Lightly brush with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper.<br> Remove the pork from the grill and let cool. Place the livers on the direct heat portion of the grill and cook, turning every 2 to 3 minutes. Cook until firm and well done, about 12 minutes.<br> Cut the pork into 1/4-inch cubes and set aside. Finely chop the chicken livers and set aside.<br> Combine the calamansi juice, liquid aminos and soy sauce in a small bowl and set aside. Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and pork and cook, continuously stirring and scraping any bits that stick to the pan as the pork begins to crisp, about 10 minutes. Be careful of any fat that splatters from the pan. Discard all but about 3 tablespoons from the skillet. Add the chopped livers, onions and minced garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are slightly crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the calamansi mixture and cook until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the Thai chiles and scallions.

Grease a loaf pan with butter and dust with flour; set aside. Combine the dates, baking soda and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and set aside. Place the salt and flour in a medium bowl and whisk to combine; set aside. Combine the butter and brown sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until light and airy, about 5 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla extract; then beat in the eggs, one at a time, just until incorporated. Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the date mixture until well combined. Add the flour mixture and the cranberries, and stir just until incorporated (don&#39;t overmix). Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Arrange the reserved cranberries, evenly spaced, on top. Bake on the center rack of the oven until the center of the cake is set and a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the toffee sauce. For the toffee sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When it foams, add the brown sugar and vanilla extract; stir once. Heat until the mixture is bubbling and has turned the color of maple syrup, about 5 minutes. While stirring, carefully add the cream in a slow stream. Cook until the sauce bubbles up and increases in volume, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. When the cake is finished cooking, remove the pan from the oven and place on a cooling rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, run a knife around the perimeter of the cake and invert the pan to unmold the cake. Place the cake upright on a serving plate. Serve at room temperature or slightly warmed, covered in warm toffee sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 69965,&quot;Baked Apples with Rum 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 cup dark rum 1/2 cup water Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 6 whole cloves 6 small to medium-size apples, preferably a \\sturdy\\ variety like Rome or Granny Smith, washed and cored 6 cinnamon sticks 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces 1 cup apple cider Rum raisin ice cream, optional Sour cream, optional Instructions: These are so satisfying and don&#39;t break the calorie bank if eaten without the ice cream. They can also be made without the rum. I have suggested rum raisin ice cream because I love the combination, but vanilla ice cream or even lemon sorbet would be just as delicious. For the glaze: In a medium saucepan, combine the dark brown sugar, rum, water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. Stir to blend and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and reduce for 3 to 4 minutes to allow the sugar and other ingredients to blend together. Prepare the apples: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a baking dish large enough to hold all of the apples, arrange the apples in a single layer. Put a cinnamon stick inside the cavity made from coring each apple. Pour the glaze over the apples and top each with pieces of butter. Add the cider to the bottom of the dish and place it in the center of the oven. Cook the apples, basting them from time to time, 25 to 30 minutes, or until they are tender but not mushy. Cook&#39;s Note: Smaller apples will take less time. Serve with scoops of ice cream or sour cream, if desired or just by themselves. They are also delicious leftover. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 69966,&quot;Chocolate Cups with Whipped Cream 2/3 cup whole milk 1 egg 2 tablespoons sugar Pinch salt 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 2 tablespoons hazelnut liqueur or dark rum 1 cup whipping cream Mint sprigs, for garnish, optional Instructions: Heat milk in a small pan over moderate heat until it comes to a boil.

Remove and allow to cool. Roast the seeds until toasted and crunchy, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove and allow to cool on the baking sheet so they get extra crispy. For the hummus: In a blender, combine the chickpeas with an equal amount (by volume) of the roasted squash pieces. Add the tahini, olive oil, paprika, cumin and garlic. Start the blender on low, then increase the speed, using the blender tamper to push down the ingredients into the blades to get a smooth consistency without having to water down the mixture too much. If you need to, stop and scrape down the sides occasionally. Season with salt and pepper and continue to blend until you have a smooth puree. Add a little water if needed to get the mixture moving. Scrape out the hummus and place into a wide serving bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with paprika and fresh parsley and scatter the spicy seeds around the edge.

Stir with a wooden spoon until some of the fat is rendered. Add the onion and saute until tender and the bacon is cooked and crisp, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, milk, and salt and pepper, to taste, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, gradually add the grits in a low steady stream, whisking continually. Reduce the heat to low and stir frequently until the liquid is almost absorbed and the grits are thick, about 10 minutes. Add the smoked Gouda, whisking all the while to melt the cheese. Stir in heavy cream and butter. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper, if needed. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately with the Collard Greens. For the Collard Greens: Remove and discard the tough stems and center ribs of the collard greens. Stack the leaves and roll tightly into a cylinder. Thinly slice the collards into ribbons about 1/16th of an inch thick. Repeat with any remaining collard greens. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. When the oil shimmers add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add the collard greens, toss quickly with tongs, and saute until bright green, about 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the chicken stock and cook until the liquid evaporates, another 2 minutes.

Place whole potatoes in saucepan of cold water. Bring to the boil, add a good pinch of salt, and cook for about 12 minutes, or until just tender. Drain, allow to cool completely, and thinly slice. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in an 8-inch nonstick (ovenproof) frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until soft and translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Continue cooking until the onions become a little caramelized, and are reduced to a quarter in volume. You don&#39;t want to let anything get too brown. Remove the onions from the pan, and set aside. Prepare the mackerel by peeling the skin off one side and breaking into smallish pieces with your hands. Add the remaining oil to the pan, and layer up, alternating the potato slices, onions and mackerel chunks. Aim for at least 3 or 4 layers. Whisk the eggs, cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl, and pour over the layers, lifting the bottom a little to encourage even distribution. Let cook 2 minutes or so on the burner to get a nice base and start to cook the sides. Place the pan in the oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until browned, and cooked through. When it&#39;s ready the edges will be browning, and the top will be puffed up with no signs of runny egg. Run a sharp knife around the edge and inverting a serving platter on top of the pan, flip the tortilla over, and turn out onto the platter, and slice into wedges.

Rub the spice blend all over the pork. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Put the pork in a roasting pan and roast it for about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer stuck into the thickest part of the pork should register 170 degrees F, but basically, what you want to do is to roast it until it&#39;s falling apart. While the pork is roasting, make the barbecue sauce. Combine the vinegar, mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, salt, cayenne, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer gently, stirring, for 10 minutes until the sugar dissolves. Take it off the heat and let it sit until you&#39;re ready for it. When the pork is done, take it out of the oven and put it on a large platter. Allow the meat to rest for about 10 minutes. While it&#39;s resting, deglaze the pan over medium heat with 3/4 cup water, scraping with a wooden spoon to pick up all of the browned bits. Reduce by about half. Pour that into the saucepan with the sauce and cook 5 minutes. While the pork is still warm, you want to \\pull\\ the meat: Grab 2 forks. Using 1 to steady the meat, use the other to \\pull\\ shreds of meat off the roast. Put the shredded pork in a bowl and pour half of the sauce over. Stir it all up well so that the pork is coated with the sauce. To serve, spoon the pulled pork mixture onto the bottom half of each hamburger bun, and top with some slaw. Serve with pickle spears and the remaining sauce on the side. Combine the cabbage, carrots, red onion, green onions, and cl in a large bowl. In another bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, and sugar. Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss gently to mix. Season the cole slaw with the celery seed, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper. Chill for 2 hours in the refrigerator before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 69996,&quot;Chocolate Pots de Creme 6.5 ounces 72 percent bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1 1/4 cups heavy cream<br> 3/4 cup whole milk<br> 5 large egg yolks<br> 2/3 cup sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste<br> Instructions: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 325 degrees F. Put the chocolate into a medium bowl. Combine the cream and milk in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let sit for 30 seconds or so to allow the chocolate to melt, then stir together until smooth. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla paste. Slowly stream the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture, whisking constantly. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl or pitcher, then pour into six 4-ounce ramekins or ceramic cups or bowls. Arrange the ramekins in a baking dish or pan and carefully add enough hot water to come about two-thirds of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Carefully place the baking dish in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and let the pots de creme sit in the hot water for 5 minutes. If they still appear very jiggly in the middle, let them sit for another 5 minutes in the hot water. You want the custards to be very firm around the edges and to barely move toward the center when gently shaken. Remove the ramekins from the hot water and let cool in a cool area of the kitchen before serving, or chill to serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Gris, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 69997,&quot;Vegetable Fried Rice 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large egg, beaten Kosher salt 2 cups baby spinach 1/2 cup chopped broccoli florets 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper 1/4 cup shredded carrots 1/4 cup thinly sliced snow peas 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger 1 teaspoon soy sauce 3 cups cold cooked long-grain white rice 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil Instructions: Heat a large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat and then swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil.

Keep the gnocchi covered and refrigerated until ready to use. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Combine the lamb, onion, bay leaves, garlic, and rosemary in a roasting pan (see Cook?s Note for clay roasting alternative). Drizzle the lamb mixture with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and mix well. Roast the lamb turning it after about 20 minutes. Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 40 minutes. Add the wine and stock, stir to coat, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Braise until the lamb is tender and cooked through, about 30 minutes more. Meanwhile, peel and trim the eggplant then cut it into ?-inch cubes. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant, turning it frequently, until golden. Remove the eggplant from the skillet using a slotted spoon. Allow the eggplant to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Add the eggplant and the gnocchi to the lamb stew. Top the stew with both the grated and broken pieces of Pecorino Romano cheese. Return the pot to the oven and cook until the liquid has reduced and is thickened by the melted cheese, about 15 minutes more. Remove the lamb from the oven and allow the stew to rest for 10 minutes. Spoon lamb with gnocchi, eggplant and sauce into warm bowls and serve. Place the potatoes in a medium size saucepan. Add a pinch of salt and enough water to cover the potatoes by 2 inches. Bring the contents of the pot to a boil over high heat. Reduce the temperature and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes and allow them to cool just enough to handle. Peel, then mash or rice them. Place the flour and the salt in a mixing bowl. Add the warm smoothly mashed potatoes. Using a wooden spoon, mix the ingredients together. Drizzle the potato dough with olive oil and 1/4-cup of water. Mix well, incorporating all of the ingredients and forming a smooth ball. Set the dough aside for 10 minutes to relax. Working on a floured surface, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each portion of dough into a rope about 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut each rope into 1/4-inch pieces. Shape each piece of dough into a small ball. Roll the dough balls over the tines of a fork then set them aside on a lightly floured baking sheet. Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so that the water is at a simmer. Working in batches, add gnocchi to the pot (shaking off any excess flour). Stir gently and cook the gnocchi until they float then remove them with a slotted spoon. They can be dressed and served at this point or chilled in an ice bath, drained then dressed with a little olive oil if they are to be held for several hours. Once cooked gnocchi can be stored in the refrigerator but should be eaten the same day they are made. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 70000,&quot;Thermos of Grok/Hot Toddy 1 cup boiling water 2 count pour of rum, or to taste 2 teaspoons honey 3 thin lemon slices Instructions: Combine ingredients in thermos and shake. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Brandy, Whiskey]&quot; 70001,&quot;Mango-Raspberry Margarita Float 2 shots silver tequila 1 scoop mango sorbet<br> 1 scoop raspberry sorbet<br> Juice of 1 lime<br> Lemon-lime soda, for topping Instructions: Pour the tequila into a tall glass.

Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of EVOO. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, then drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the potatoes to the fat in the skillet and season with a little salt and lots of pepper. Cook until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Cover with foil and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the foil and cook until crisp, 7 to 8 more minutes. Mix the sour cream, chives, dill, garlic, horseradish, 2 tablespoons parsley and half-and-half or milk in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix the beef, Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard cayenne or hot sauce and the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and lots of pepper. Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Brush with oil, then add the beef mixture in 4 loose balls of equal size (do not shape them with your hands). Flatten with a spatula into 3/4-inch-thick patties. Scatter the onion slices over the top and press in with the spatula. Cook for 3 minutes, then flip and press the onion into the patties. Cook for 2 more minutes. Douse the pan with the beer and lay the cheese over the patties. Cover and cook until the cheese melts, about 1 minute. Serve the burgers on the rolls with pickles and watercress.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. For the craquelin: Add the butter and sugar to a stand mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until combined. Add the flour and beat to combine. Stir in a few drops of food coloring of choice and beat until uniform in color. Scoop the paste out onto a sheet of parchment paper with a rubber spatula. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and use your hands to press out into an even sheet. Then roll gently a few times with a rolling pin to flatten to an even 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet and freeze for 20 minutes. When the craquelin is frozen, remove it from the freezer. Peel the top piece of parchment off and cut rounds with a 3/4-inch round cutter. For the choux dough: Meanwhile, combine the butter, sugar, salt and 2 cups water in a medium saucepan over low heat. Once the butter has melted, bring it to a boil over medium heat. As soon as it boils, remove the pan from the heat and sift the flour directly into the pan. Stir the mixture into a paste with a wooden spoon; you will have to beat it hard. Return the pan to medium heat. Stir the batter continuously until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and is slightly shiny, about 3 minutes. Transfer the batter to a stand mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until slightly cooled, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one thoroughly before adding the next. Fit a large pastry bag with a plain round tip and fill with the choux dough. Pipe twelve 2-inch circular mounds, about 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the batter has a peak, dab it smooth with a wet fingertip. Beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water and brush the surface of the puffs with the beaten yolk. Using a small offset spatula, gently lift the craqulin rounds off the parchment and place on top of the cream puffs. Bake on the middle rack for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and continue baking until the puffs are golden brown, light, airy and crisp, 30 to 35 more minutes. If the cream puffs still don&#39;t feel completely dry and crisp at the end of the baking time, poke a hole in the bottom with a paring knife and place them back into the oven for a few more minutes to crisp up. Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack. Fill a pastry bag with a small plain tip with the Vanilla Pastry Cream. Fill each puff with the pastry cream from the hole in the bottom. To assemble: Mix the sugar, corn syrup and 1 cup water together in a heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a boil. Continue to boil until it reaches the hard crack stage at 300 degrees F. Use the hot syrup to adhere the puffs to about a 16-inch foam cone covered in foil, or pile up to form a mound. If the hard candy caramel gets too thick, heat it gently. Whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. Add the milk, eggs and vanilla bean seeds and whisk to combine. Turn the heat to medium-high.Whisk often to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Once thick, after about 10 minutes, turn off the heat, add the butter and stir until combined. Pour the pastry cream into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface. Place in the fridge to cool completely, about 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70005,&quot;Ultimate Ham Sandwich 1 large egg yolk (from a pasteurized egg) 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar Kosher salt 1/2 cup vegetable or grapeseed oil 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Spread Homemade Mayonnaise (recipe follows) on a thick slice of crusty white or rye bread. Top with Bibb lettuce, sliced tomato, thick slices of leftover ham, a few dill pickle slices and sliced cheddar cheese. Spread whole-grain mustard on another slice of bread, then close the sandwich. Whisk the egg yolk, vinegar and 1 tablespoon water in a medium nonreactive heatproof bowl (glass or ceramic). Fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside. Bring 2 inches water to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Set the bowl with the yolk mixture over the saucepan (do not let the bowl touch the water). Slowly whisk until a thermometer inserted into the yolk mixture registers 150 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes. Set the bowl with the yolk mixture in the ice water to stop the cooking; whisk just until the mixture is lukewarm (do not let it get cold). Put the bowl with the yolk mixture on a damp towel. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt. Combine the oils in a measuring cup. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle the oil into the bowl in a thin stream until smooth and thick. If at any point the oil is not emulsifying into the mixture, stop adding the oil and whisk to combine before continuing. Whisk in 1 to 2 teaspoons water if the mayonnaise is too thick.

Add wild rice and 1 tablespoon butter (reserving the rest of the butter), cover, reduce heat to low and let simmer undisturbed for 50 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes before removing lid. Stir and allow to cool to room temperature. While the wild rice is cooking, melt another tablespoon of butter over medium heat (reserving the rest of the butter) in a large skillet and cook the sausage until browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage to a bowl. Pour most of the sausage fat from the pan, leaving about 1 tablespoon of fat. Add the apples and saute until tender. Using a slotted spoon, remove them to the bowl with the sausage. To the same pan, add oil if the pan is too dry and cook the onion until translucent. Cook the liver until cooked through and remove to a carving board to cool to room temperature. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan and saute the celery, thyme, sage, marjoram, and parsley over medium heat until tender. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat. Cut the liver down into 1/4-inch cubes. Combine the liver with the wild rice, sausage, apples, and sauteed herbs. Add beaten eggs and mix well. Set aside briefly.

It&#39;s a version of a recipe I learned from Shirley Corriher but I like mine a little less sweet and not quite as rich as hers. All you need is an ice cream scoop for shaping. And use Lily White Flour if you can get it.

Pulse to combine. With the machine running, gradually add the oil then 1/3 to 1/2 cup water until the mixture forms a dough (the dough should stick together if pinched between your fingers). If necessary, add additional water, 1 teaspoon at a time if the dough is too dry. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Gather the dough into a ball and knead until the dough is smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough into quarters and press flat. Run each piece of pasta dough several times through a pasta-rolling machine, adjusting the setting each time, until the pasta is about 1/8 to 1/16-inch thick. Cut the pasta into the desired shape and use as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 70018,&quot;Pasta-Rella Highlander Style 3 pounds part-skim mozzarella block 3 egg yolks 5 cups bread crumbs 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning 10 sheets fresh egg pasta (7-by-10 inches per sheet) Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup favorite marinara or pizza sauce 3 tablespoons Parmesan Instructions: Slice cheese into 1/2-by-1/2-by-6-inch long cubes and set aside.

For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Halve the onions through the root and peel. Cut one half into two wedges. Slice the remaining onion half into 1/8-inch half-moons and reserve for pickling. Drizzle the tomato halves and onion wedges with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the tomato and onion wedges on the hot side of the grill, covered, until dark grill marks appear, about 5 minutes per side. Place the grilled tomato and onion in a food processor, along with the 1/4 cup vegetable oil, chopped cilantro, smoked paprika, brown sugar, cumin, oregano, garlic, chipotle peppers, 1 tablespoon cider vinegar, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Blend until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and add the beef chunks. Toss to coat. Lay out a large double-layered sheet of extra-wide heavy-duty foil. Put the beef in the center. (If using regular-width foil, divide the beef into 2 foil packets.) Bring the short ends of the foil together and fold twice to seal; fold in the other sides to seal, leaving room for steam. Place on the indirect side of the grill and cover. Cook until the meat is tender and shreddable, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Meanwhile, combine 3/4 cup cider vinegar, 3/4 cup water and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. When the liquid comes to a boil, stir in the reserved sliced onions and turn off the heat. Let cool completely and refrigerate until ready to use. Shred the beef and return to the sauce; toss well to coat. Serve with warm grilled tortillas, pickled red onions, and other desired toppings. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 70020,&quot;Penne alla Vodka 1 pound penne 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 whole medium onion, chopped finely 3 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup vodka One 14-ounce can tomato puree or tomato sauce 1 cup heavy cream 1 generous pinch red pepper flakes, plus more if needed 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper Grated Parmesan, for serving Instructions: Cook the pasta according to package directions.

In a small bowl combine the cayenne, rosemary, and garlic. Add enough olive oil until it becomes a loose paste. Schmear the roast with the rosemary-garlic paste and really massage it into the meat. Season generously with kosher salt. Put the onions, baby carrots, celery and mushrooms in the bottom of a roasting pan. Toss with a little olive oil and salt, to taste. Add the wine, 1 cup of chicken stock and the bay leaves. Put the roast on top of the veggies and put into the preheated oven until the roast is really brown and lovely, about 25 to 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F for another 1 3/4 to 2 hours. Occasionally during the cooking time, spoon some of the juices over the meat. If the liquid level in the pan goes down too much, add the remaining 1 cup of stock. It also would be a great idea to rotate the roasting pan about halfway through the cooking process. Check the temperature of the meat by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the center of the roast. For medium-rare it should be 125 degrees F and 130 for medium. Remove the roast from the oven to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Taste the veggies in the pan juices and season with salt, to taste, if needed. Skim off any excess fat. Slice the roast and arrange on a serving platter.

Measure the oil into a very large (12-inch) skillet and set over medium-high heat. If the skin of the 2 halves of the trout is still connected, cut them apart, making 2 fillets. Sprinkle the fish generously with salt and lay skin side up in the hot oil. Cook until golden underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. (If they don&#39;t fit comfortably in the pan, cook them in 2 batches.) Use a spatula to turn the fish and cook for a minute longer, until the flesh separates from the skin (use a corner of your spatula check at 1 edge). With the spatula, transfer a pair of fillets to each of 4 dinner plates, flipping them skin side down. Keep warm in the oven. Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium. Add the garlic and cook a few seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly. Pour the broth into the skillet, and add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the green beans. Cover the skillet (a cookie sheet works, if you don&#39;t have a lid large enough) and cook until the green beans are barely tender, 6 to 7 minutes. While the green beans are cooking, cut the cl(s) in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Chop finely. When the beans are ready, uncover the skillet and add the cl(s). Increase the heat to high and cook for a minute or so to concentrate the broth. Then add the macadamias, cilantro, and lime juice and mix well. Taste and season with salt, probably another 1/2 teaspoon. Spoon a portion over each fillet and dinner&#39;s ready. Serve with Roasted Poblano Mashed Potatoes, if desired. In a large saucepan over high heat, add potatoes, salt, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, uncovered until soft, about 20 minutes.

Line the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside. Turn an 8-inch bowl upside down and spray the outside with nonstick cooking spray. Cover the outside of the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside. Prepare the vanilla mousse mix with the whole milk in another bowl according to package instructions. (The milk amount is reduced from package instructions.) Pour the mousse into the lined 9.5-inch bowl. Place the smaller bowl inside and press gently to spread the filling up the sides of the bowl until just below the rim. Put the bowls in the freezer until firmly set, at least 4 hours. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the watermelon cubes out onto the baking sheet in an even layer. Put in the freezer until frozen, at least 3 hours. Combine the frozen watermelon cubes, sweetened condensed milk and red food coloring in a food processor. Pulse to break up the watermelon cubes, then let the processor run until the mixture is smooth with a texture like soft serve ice cream. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and mix in the mini chocolate chips. Remove the bowls from the freezer. Remove the smaller bowl, revealing a well in the frozen mousse layer. Transfer the watermelon mixture into the well and spread with an offset spatula so the watermelon is smooth and is level with the mousse layer. Place a 10-inch cardboard cake board on top of the cake. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the freezer until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. This can be done up to 2 weeks in advance. When ready to decorate, prepare the Watermelon Mirror Glaze. Fit a cooling rack into a baking sheet. Put 3 ramekins on the cooling rack so that the cake can be elevated over the rack. Remove the bowl from the freezer. Discard the plastic wrap covering the cake. Invert the bowl and remove the cake. (If you have trouble removing the cake you can place the bowl in warm water to help loosen it.) Place the cake on the ramekins on the cooling rack. Pour the green mirror glaze over the frozen cake, then squeeze on lines of the yellow mirror glaze. Put in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before serving.

Roast it in the marinade in the center rack of the oven until an instant-read thermometer shows an internal temperature of 165 degrees, about 40 minutes. Let the chicken cool slightly, then pull off the meat in large shreds, discarding the bones. Toss the shredded chicken with any leftover juices in the pan. Sandwich build: Spread some Pickapeppa Sour Cream on both sides of the bread. Place some of the Mango Chutney on the bread. Put on a layer of shredded chicken and top with some Fried Plaintains and cilantro. Serve extra plantains on the side. Enjoy, man! Mix together the sour cream, pickapeppa sauce and lime zest in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix together the mangos, sugar, raisins, ginger, garlic, jalapeno and salt to taste in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Combine the mango mixture with the vinegar and turmeric in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent the chutney from sticking to the pan until thickened and thoroughly combined, about 20 minutes. Fill a Dutch oven halfway with canola oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Peel the plantain and slice it lengthwise into long thin strips. (A mandolin slicer will give you the best results.) You can crack the peppercorns by crushing them with a heavy pan on a cutting board; you are looking for a very coarse grind. Drop the plantain strips in the hot oil and allow them to fry up crispy, about 1 minute. Transfer the plantains directly to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with salt and the cracked black peppercorns. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70041,&quot;Flourless Chocolate Cakes 4 ounces unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces 5 eggs, separated Pinch salt 2/3 cup sugar Powdered sugar, for garnish Unsweetened whipped cream, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Pat the meat dry and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and brown the meat well on all sides in 2 batches. Transfer the short ribs to a plate. Drain off the fat from the pot and add the remaining oil. Add the carrots, celery and onions and cook until softened, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the flour 1 minute, then add the tomato paste and continue stirring until fragrant. Pour in the port and return the ribs to the pot. Bring to boil, then lower to a simmer and reduce the port by half, about 30 minutes. Stir in the stock, thyme, sage, rosemary, marjoram, garlic and the handful of parsley. Return to a boil, then cover and place in the oven, 2 hours 30 minutes. As soon as you remove the beef from the oven, bring the potatoes to a boil in salted water and cook until tender. Transfer the beef to a platter and strain the sauce. Skim the fat by either quickly placing ice cubes into a metal ladleful of sauce (the fat will stick to the bottom of the ladle), or by carefully spooning the fat from the surface with a large spoon. Return the sauce to the heat to reduce and thicken a bit while the potatoes cook. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Drain the potatoes and return to the hot pot. Mash the potatoes with the cream and butter and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Serve the ribs with the potatoes and top with the sauce, pomegranate seeds, if using, and the chopped parsley. Serve with steamed green beans or green salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 70064,&quot;Brown Butter Mashed Potatoes 5 pounds Yukon gold potatoes 2 1/2 sticks (1 1/4 cups) salted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 packages cream cheese (12 ounces total), at room temperature<br> 1/2 cup half-and-half<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Milk, if needed, for thinning<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish<br> Instructions: Peel the potatoes, rinse in cold water and cut into fourths. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, add the butter to a saucepan over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to burn it. Swirl the pan as you go, stopping when the solids turn medium to deep golden brown. Drain the potatoes, then return them to the pot. With the burner on low heat, mash the potatoes with a potato masher; the more steam that&#39;s released while you mash, the better. Mash for about 5 minutes. Turn off the burner. Add the cream cheese, half-and-half, cream, some salt and pepper and three-quarters of the brown butter to the pot and stir to combine. If the mixture needs thinning, add some milk. Check the seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the remaining brown butter over the top. Sprinkle with fresh parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70065,&quot;Brussels Sprouts with Bacon 4 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Instructions: Set a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Kosher salt Olive oil All-purpose flour for dusting 8 ounces pound slab bacon, cut into lardons 3 ribs celery, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1 pound cremini or white button mushrooms, quartered 1/2 cup brandy 1/4 cup tomato paste 3 cups hearty red wine 1/2 pound small cipollini onions, (If you can&#39;t find cipollini onions, pearl onions are a good substitute) 4 to 6 cups chicken stock 3 bay leaves 1 bundle of fresh thyme 12 ounces pound fingerling potatoes, cut in 1-inch slices Fresh chives, finely chopped, for garnish Instructions: Coat a large 7-quart Dutch oven or rondeau with olive oil and bring to a medium high heat. Pat the capon dry and sprinkle generously with salt, to taste. Working in batches if necessary, coat the capon gently with flour and put immediately in the hot oil. Only flour the capon that you are working with in that batch- no premature flouring. Premature flouring will result in doughy, gritty, mealy capon rather than crispy. Brown on all sides, and then remove from the pan to paper towels. Remove any excess oil from the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and add the bacon lardons to the pan with a tiny splash of new olive oil. Cook the bacon until it is brown and crispy. Add the celery and onions, season with salt and cook until the veggies are starting to soften, are very aromatic and have no color, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms give off their juices, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the brandy and cook until it has reduced down. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine. The mixture will become very thick--that is good! Stir in the wine and bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Toss in the cipollini onions, skin and all! Cook the onions for 3 to 4 minutes and then strain. When the onions are cool enough to handle, remove the skin and discard, reserving the onions. Return the legs and thighs of the capon to the pan, reserving the breasts. Stir in enough chicken stock until the chicken is three-quarters covered. Add the bay leaves and thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Taste for seasoning and adjust, if needed. Add the cipollini onions and the potatoes. Partially cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes. After the capon has simmered for 20 minutes, turn the legs and thighs over and add the breasts. Check the level of liquid and add more chicken stock if needed. Partially cover the pan and simmer for another 15 minutes. Remove the capon from the pan and skim the sauce, if necessary. If the sauce is on the thin side reduce it down until it becomes a sauce-like consistency. Season. Transfer the capon to a serving platter, garnish with chopped chives and serve with lots of the sauce.

When it&#39;s cold, place the mango sorbet in the bowl and press it against the sides of the bowl. If you have a 6 1/2-inch bowl the same shape as the 8-inch bowl (such as from a set of nesting bowls), cover it with plastic wrap and press it into the sorbet to make the layer even. Freeze the sorbet for 30 minutes or until firm. Remove the 6 1/2-inch bowl. Spread an even layer of softened raspberry sorbet on top of the mango sorbet (a 4 1/2-inch nesting bowl wrapped in plastic wrap helps with this) and freeze for another 30 minutes or until firm. Remove the 4 1/2 inch bowl. Finally, spoon in enough softened strawberry ice cream to fill the bowl. Freeze until hard. To unmold, dip the bowl up to the rim in warm water. Run a knife around the edge to loosen the bombe and unmold upside down onto a flat plate. You may need to run a flexible metal spatula along the edge of the bombe to release it.

Cook the brisket: Tie the circumference of the brisket with butcher\\u2019s twine. In a large Dutch oven or other wide heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, sprinkle both sides of the brisket with salt and pepper. Use metal tongs to add the meat to the pot. If the oil is hot enough, the meat won\\u2019t stick. Cook, undisturbed, on its first side, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn on the other side and brown, 3 to 5 additional minutes. Remove the meat from the pot and place it on a baking sheet. Cook the vegetables: Lower the heat to medium. In the same pot, add the carrots, shallots and garlic and sprinkle them with another pinch of salt. Brown for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the sugar and vinegar and simmer over very low heat until the liquid reduces and starts to coat the carrots, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the vegetables and cooking liquid into a bowl. Cook the meat: Return the brisket to the pot and add the beef stock. Bring the stock to a gentle simmer. Cover, then place the pot in the center of the oven and cook for 1 hour. Remove the pot from the oven and add the vegetables and their liquid back in. Return the pot to the oven, uncovered, and cook until the meat is tender when pierced with a fork, an additional 1 to 2 hours. (If the meat looks dry or begins to get overly browned, cover the pot with the lid or a layer of aluminum foil for the remaining oven time.) Make the gremolata: In a small skillet, toast the coriander seeds in 1 teaspoon olive oil until lightly colored and fragrant. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the parsley, garlic, lemon zest and juice and a generous pinch of salt. Add the coriander seeds warm, straight from the skillet. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, then stir and set aside. Finish: Remove the pot from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, blend half the cooking liquid and half of the remaining vegetables in a blender until smooth, then pour back into the pot. Whisk in the mayonnaise and mustard. Taste for seasoning. Slice the meat against the grain. (It should be fork-tender without being dry.) Transfer the meat and the remaining vegetables to a serving platter. Pour the sauce over the meat.

Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Scoop out half of the onion and set aside. Add the broth and potato, partially cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes. The blossoms: While the broth is simmering, clean the squash blossoms: break off the stems, then the little green sepals that come out from the base of the blossoms (they originally covered the buds). Use your fingers to break loose the long pistils in the center of each flower and discard. With a very sharp knife, cut the blossoms cross-wise into 1/4-inch strips, including the bulbous base. Add half the blossoms to the broth and simmer 3 minutes. In a food processor or in batches in a loosely covered blender (or using an immersion blender), puree the mixture; return to the pot. The chiles: Roast the chiles directly over the gas flame, on a medium-hot gas grill, or 4 inches below a very hot broiler. Turn occasionally, until blistered and blackened on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes for the flame or grill, about 10 minutes for the broiler. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand about 5 minutes. Peel off the charred skin, cut out the seed pod, then quickly rinse to remove straggling bits of skin and seeds. Cut into 1/4-inch dice. Finishing the soup: Add the chiles to the soup along with the milk and reserved onion; bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Add the zucchini and corn, simmer a couple of minutes, then add the remaining squash blossoms. Simmer a couple of minutes longer (the strips of blossom will soften into deep-golden \\streamers), remove from the heat, stir in the cream, taste, and season with salt.

Lower the heat and simmer 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool completely. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a sheet pan. Cover the phyllo sheets with a piece of plastic wrap and a damp paper towel. Arrange 1 sheet of phyllo on a work surface with the short side nearest you (keep the remaining sheets covered) and brush with some butter. Top with 2 more phyllo sheets, brushing each sheet with butter. Place a heaping 1/4 cup blueberry mixture over the lower third of the buttered phyllo, leaving a 2-inch border along the bottom and sides. Fold the bottom edge of the phyllo up over the blueberry mixture and fold in the sides to enclose the filling completely. Roll up the phyllo to form a strudel, about 4 by 2 inches. Transfer, seam-side down, to the prepared sheet pan. Brush the top with some butter and sprinkle with sugar. Using a paring knife, cut 2 vents across the top of the strudel.

Cut the salmon into paper-thin slices. Reserve. Roll or stretch the dough into 4 (8-inch) circles. Place the pizzas on a lightly floured wooden peel. Brush the center of each pizza to within 1 inch of the edge with olive oil and sprinkle it with some of the red onion. Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake 8 to 12 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven. Mix the dill with the sour cream or creme fraiche and freshly ground pepper, to taste. Transfer the pizzas to heated dinner plates and spread them with the sour cream mixture. Divide the salmon, and arrange decoratively over the cream. Place a spoonful of golden caviar in the center of each pizza, then spoon a little of the black caviar into the center of the golden caviar. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough.

Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70118,&quot;Onion-Crusted Chicken with Caramel Citrus Glaze 1 quart plus 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> Salt and pepper<br> 1 red onion, julienne, plus 1/2 red onion, minced<br> 1/4 pound bacon, diced<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon tomato puree<br> 1 orange, juiced<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 1 lime, juiced<br> Two 8-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts or cutlets<br> 1 large egg, beaten<br> 1/4 cup milk<br> Instructions: Make the fried onions: Heat up to 1 quart of vegetable oil (2 to 3 inches deep) in a deep saute pan or skillet until it reaches about 350 degrees F. Put the flour in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the julienne onions and toss to coat. In batches, being careful not to crowd, add the onions to the hot oil to fry, making sure to lightly shake off excess flour prior to putting them in. When they are golden brown but not dark brown, 3 to 4 minutes per batch, use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the onions to paper towels. When the onions are done, give them a rough chop and set aside. Add the bacon and minced red onion to a nonstick saute pan and cook over medium heat until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sugar, 2 cups water and the tomato puree and reduce the mixture until it thickens, another 5 to 8 minutes. Add all the citrus juices and stir well to combine. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper. Fill one shallow bowl with the beaten egg and milk, and fill a second with the fried onions. Individually, dip the chicken breasts into the egg, then press into the fried onion. Place the chicken breasts in the heated skillet and cook until golden, about 10 minutes per side, carefully turning once. Pour the glaze over the breasts to serve. It goes great with rice or mashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 70119,&quot;Bananas with Sugar and Creme Fraiche 8 bananas 2 cups creme fraiche Unprocessed sugar, for sprinkling Instructions: Peel and cut bananas into 1/4-inch slices on the bias.

Line an 8-inch springform pan or cake pan with parchment. In a food processor combine the graham crackers, butter, sugar and salt, until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or just until it starts to turn golden brown. Cool the crust completely, then freeze the crust. To Make the Cheesecake Batter: Cream together the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, salt, eggs, vanilla, lemon juice and cornstarch, until very smooth, scraping down the bowl as needed. Divide the batter equally into 3 bowls. Add the raspberry preserves and a drop of red dye to one. Add the scraped vanilla bean to the next. Add the blueberry preserves and blue dye to the last bowl. Pour the red layer over the frozen crust and return to the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the batter is slightly firm to the touch. While this layer is chilling, place the other bowls of batter in the freezer to allow them to set as well. Once the red layer feels thick, but not frozen solid, very carefully pour the white batter over the red. Do this very slowly, in small amounts, so that it doesn&#39;t break the surface of the red layer. Freeze the pan again for about 20 minutes. Check to make sure the blue batter isn&#39;t setting too firmly in the freezer; if it is, move it to the refrigerator. Turn the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Add the blue layer in the same careful way. Place the pan on a baking sheet. Place in the oven, then pour hot water in the baking sheet, which will help the cake bake evenly. (If you are using the springform pan, you will need to cover the bottom of the springform pan with foil, to prevent any water from seeping in). Bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or when it is set in the middle. When the cake is set in the middle, remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for several hours. Run a hot knife blade around the edge before removing the cake from the pan. If you are using a regular cake pan, you will need to heat the bottom quickly over the stove, then cover the top with plastic, invert onto a plate and finally transfer to the serving platter. Refrigerate the cake while you make the topping. In a small bowl add the gelatin to the cold water, stir to combine and allow to bloom for several minutes. Once the water has absorbed all the gelatin, add it to the hot simple syrup. If you made the simple syrup ahead, heat it. Add the blueberry preserves and transfer to a clean bowl to cool. Once the glaze has come to room temperature, it will thicken, but still be pourable. Place the blueberries on top of the cake. Pour the thickened glaze over the berries. It will run down the sides, which I think is quite pretty. Refrigerate until the glaze has set a bit. If you prefer clean sides, use a hot metal spatula to scrape the excess off the sides (this is very easy to do). Use a hot blade to cut the cake to keep the stripes distinct, and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70121,&quot;Berry Ricotta Tartlets 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus extra, for dusting 1/2 cup almond flour 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 medium strawberries, chopped into 1/4 to 1/2-inch pieces to yield 1/2 cup 1/2 cup blackberries or raspberries, halved 1/2 cup blueberries 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon powdered sugar 1 1/2 cups whole milk ricotta 1/4 cup powdered sugar 2 teaspoons lemon zest Special equipment: a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter Instructions: For the crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, almond flour, and salt. Set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the honey and vanilla. With the machine running, gradually add the dry ingredients and blend until incorporated. Transfer the mixture to a work surface and knead into a dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone liner. Set aside. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 12-inch diameter circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out circles of the dough and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Gather any scraps of dough and gently knead together. Roll out until 1/4-inch thick. Cut out additional circles of dough and place on the baking sheet (there should be a total of 15 to 18 circles). Bake until slightly golden around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 15 minutes. For the berries: In a medium bowl toss together the strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, lemon juice, and sugar. Let the mixture stand for 30 minutes. For the ricotta topping: In a medium bowl, mix together the cheese, powdered sugar, and lemon zest. To assemble the tartlets: Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of the ricotta topping in the center of each crust. Using a small spoon, make a shallow well in the ricotta topping and fill with a little of the berry mixture. Arrange on a platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 70122,&quot;Peppermint Cocoa Swirl Cookies 2 1/2 cups cake flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 6 ounces good-quality white chocolate, roughly chopped Finely crushed peppermint candies, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: For the cookie dough: Sift the cake flour, baking powder and salt onto a piece of parchment or into a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg and beat until incorporated. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the flour mixture in 2 batches until just incorporated. Remove half of the dough, shape into a rectangle, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br> For the filling: Add the cocoa powder to the remaining dough and use your hands to knead it in until completely combined. Shape the chocolate dough into a rectangle, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate with for 30 minutes. Roll each dough piece between 2 pieces of parchment to a roughly 11-by-8-inch rectangle. Refrigerate the rolled dough for an additional 20 minutes.<br> Stack the vanilla dough on top of the chocolate, then peel away all of the parchment except the piece on the bottom of the chocolate dough. Use the parchment to help roll the dough into a tight spiral to form a tight log. Cover the log in plastic wrap and freeze until solid, 1 to 2 hours.<br> Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.<br> Cut 1/4 inch off each end of the log with a sharp knife to reveal the swirled pattern. Slice the log into 1/4-inch-thick slices, about 34 total. Divide the slices between the prepared baking sheets. Bake, rotating the baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through the cooking time, until the tops of the cookies are no longer tacky, about 10 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. For the add-ins: Once the cookies are cooled, microwave the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring every 15 seconds, until completely melted. Dip the cookies halfway into the chocolate, then sprinkle or dip in the crushed peppermint candies. Allow the chocolate to set before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70123,&quot;Tex-Mex Chicken and Corn Soup 4 ears corn, shucked 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large poblano cl pepper, stemmed and seeded, thinly sliced 1 onion, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 teaspoon chili powder 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 10-ounce can diced tomatoes with green chiles 1 15-ounce can hominy, drained and rinsed 4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken (about 12 ounces) 1 1/2 cups crushed tortilla chips 2 scallions, thinly sliced Instructions: Cut the corn kernels off the cobs and transfer to a small bowl.

Lightly spray a large, oven-safe bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Mix the flour, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, cloves and salt in a medium bowl. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar. Mix in the molasses and egg, and then stir in the flour mixture. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thick. Carefully cover the bowl with the dough, trimming the excess. Roll out the remaining dough and cut out small gingerbread men. Chill the bowl and the gingerbread men in the freezer for 20 minutes. Place the bowl and gingerbread men on a sheet tray, and bake until just golden at the edges and no longer translucent looking, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool completely. For the cream: In a medium bowl, whisk 1/2 cup milk into the cornstarch until blended and smooth. Add the egg yolks and whisk until blended, set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining 3 1/2 cups milk with the granulated sugar. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, whisking occasionally. Pour three-quarters of the hot milk very slowly in a steady stream into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Then whisk the tempered egg mixture back into the remaining milk in the saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla until blended and smooth. Divide the pastry cream among 3 mixing bowls. Add the nutmeg to one bowl. In the next bowl, add the cherry puree and some red gel if using. In the last bowl, add the pistachio paste and some green gel if using. Cover the surface of each pastry cream with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until cooled. Whip the cream to stiff peaks, then gently fold one-third of the whipped cream into each pastry cream. For the icing: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and egg whites. Mix at a slow speed until the mixture is stiff enough to form peaks; keep beating until the icing is pure white, fluffy and shiny. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the icing to a pastry bag, and hold it at room temperature until ready to decorate. To assemble, use a knife or small offset spatula to remove the gingerbread from the bowl. Cut the tip of the pastry bag of royal icing and pipe festive designs around the outside of the bowl and the gingerbread men. Decorate with candies as desired, then set aside to dry completely.

Add the basil leaves to the boiling water and cook for exactly 15 seconds. Remove the basil with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge the leaves into the ice water to set the bright green color. Drain and set aside. Peel the potatoes and cut them in quarters. Add the potatoes to the same pot of boiling water and return to a boil. Cook the potatoes for 20 to 25 minutes, until very tender. Drain well, return to the saucepan, and steam over low heat until any remaining water evaporates. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the half-and-half and Parmesan cheese until the cream simmers. Place the basil in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and puree. Add the hot cream mixture and process until smooth. With a handheld mixer with the beater attachment, beat the hot potatoes in the pot until they are broken up. Slowly add the hot basil cream, the salt, and pepper and beat until smooth. If the potatoes need to be reheated, cover and cook gently over low heat for a few minutes. Pour into a serving bowl, sprinkle with extra Parmesan cheese, season to taste, and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70146,&quot;Carrot Salad 6 large carrots, peeled 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for water 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the whole carrots (cut them in half if they don&#39;t fit in the pot) and cook until just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and cut carrots into 1/2-inch thick slices. Whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, cumin, cayenne, and salt in a large bowl. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil until emulsified and stir in the parsley. Add the cooked carrots and toss to combine. Serve cold or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 70147,&quot;Cinnamon Stars: Zimtsterne (Germany) 15 ounces sliced almonds, with skin (about 4 1/2 cups) 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 3 large egg whites, room temperature 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest 2 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for rolling* (please see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar. Put 1/2 cup of the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar, 10 ounces (3 heaping cups) of the almonds and all the cinnamon in a food processor. Process until the nuts are finely ground, with just a few larger pieces. Whip the egg whites in a large, clean bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until they hold soft peaks, about 1 minute. Gradually add the remaining confectioners&#39; sugar while whipping, until the whites are thick, creamy and somewhat stiff, about 2 minutes more. Set aside 2/3 cup of this meringue for topping the cookies. Fold the ground almond mixture and the lemon zest into the remaining meringue to make a stiff dough. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Lay a sheet of parchment or waxed paper on the work surface and lightly dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Turn the dough out onto the dusted paper, flatten and dust with more sugar as needed, and then lay another sheet of parchment or waxed paper on top. Roll the dough between the papers until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Flip the dough over and gently peel off a sheet of the paper. For ease when cutting, lay the paper back on the dough, flip again and gently pull off the other side of the paper so that the dough is fully released from it. Cut cookies with a 3-inch star cutter and place about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. (Excess dough can be rerolled.) Use a small spoon, brush or offset spatula to spread the reserved meringue over the top of each cookie, taking care not to let the meringue drip over the sides. Press or sprinkle remaining sliced almonds in a decorative pattern into the meringue. Bake cookies until bottoms are light golden brown and meringue is set and crisp, about 30 minutes. Turn off the oven and open the oven door to release heat and dry cookies out in the oven for 10 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70148,&quot;Ginger Tuna on Rice Crackers with Wasabi Aioli 3/4 pound fresh tuna steak 1-inch-long knob fresh ginger, peeled 2 cloves garlic, 1 sliced and 1 minced 1 teaspoon soy sauce 1/4 cup soy or vegetable oil 1 teaspoon wasabi powder 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 drop green food coloring (optional) 30 tamari-flavored rice crackers 1 teaspoon black sesame seeds 1 small red bell pepper, finely diced Instructions: Using a sharp knife, slice the tuna into 1/2-inch strips with the grain, then cut the strips into triangular pieces and place them in a mixing bowl. Puree the ginger with the sliced garlic in the bowl of a food processor. Scrape the sides of the bowl, add the soy sauce, and slowly pour the oil in with the machine running. Drizzle this mixture over the fish and gently toss to cool. Marinate the tuna for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a bowl, combine the wasabi with a few drops of water, then add the minced garlic and mayonnaise. Add salt and pepper to taste and the green food coloring (if desired) to intensify the color of wasabi. Place the wasabi mayonnaise in a squeeze bottle if available. Remove the tuna from the marinade, place on a greased baking sheet, and bake it for 3 to 4 minutes, until the inside is pink. Or pan-sear in a hot skillet over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Place the pieces of tuna on rice crackers, and top each with a little wasabi aioli.

Holding the tip and stem of each asparagus spear, snap the asparagus where it will naturally break. Discard the ends. Toss the asparagus with oil and salt to taste. Grill the asparagus until slightly charred and pliable on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes for pencil or 5 to 7 minutes for standard. Remove to a platter and reserve at room temperature. Grill each slice of bread until crispy and slightly charred on both sides. Rub each piece of bread vigorously with the raw garlic clove. Reserve with the asparagus. Fill a bowl with cold tap water and the ice cubes. This will be the holding area for the eggs after they have been poached. Keep the bowl near the stove. Fill a medium saucepan two-thirds of the way with water. Add the white vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat on the burner until the bubbles in the water have subsided. Gently crack and drop each egg into the water. Cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes. When done, the whites will be cooked through and the yolks will be warm but still liquid. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the saucepan and place in the bowl of cold water. Reserve. To assemble the salad: Toss the arugula with half of the lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Gently toss the salad until coated with the lemon and olive oil. Add more lemon juice and oil if needed. TASTE IT! The salad should be dressed and flavorful but not soggy. Divide the arugula among 4 individual plates. Arrange the asparagus on top of the arugula on each plate. While dressing the salad, bring the saucepan of poaching water to a simmer. Gently return the eggs to the saucepan until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. When the eggs are hot, remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and gently blot on a tea towel to remove any excess water. Immediately place 1 egg on top of the asparagus on each plate. Sprinkle each with some salt, Parmigiano and lemon zest. Drizzle each piece of grilled bread generously with olive oil and cut in half on the bias. Lean the toast halves against each egg.

Stir in the cinnamon. Remove the double boiler insert, holding the melted chocolate, from the saucepan. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes.<br> In the frozen mixing bowl, whip the cream to firm peaks. (Do not overbeat.)<br> With a rubber spatula, fold 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate. Gently fold the remaining whipped cream into the chocolate, 1/4 at a time. (Mix just enough to get the chocolate incorporated into the whipped cream.) Set aside in the refrigerator. For the cream puffs: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a medium size heavy saucepan, combine the milk, butter and salt. Bring to a boil. Add the flour all at once. Mix quickly with a wooden spoon until a ball forms on the spoon and the flour is evenly moistened. Transfer to a bowl and add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Place the cream puff dough in a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip. Pipe out 6 round puffs on a parchment lined baking sheet. With a finger dipped in cold water, flatten the point on top of each puff. Drop the pan on the counter to set the puffs. Bake the puffs until puffed and golden, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake 20 to 25 minutes longer, or until puffed, golden, and done. Set aside to cool on a rack. For the assembly: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip with the Chocolate Mousse. Split the puffs in half lengthwise and fill them with the mousse. Using the tips of your fingers, drizzle melted chocolate (about 3 ounces melted over hot water) across the tops of the filled cream puffs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70169,&quot;Take to Work Scrambled Egg Breakfast Burritto 1 (13-ounce) can tomatillos or 6 medium peeled and cored tomatillos, cut into quarters 6 medium peeled and cored tomatillos, cut into quarters 1/4 jalapeno, seeded and cut into several pieces 1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves 1/2 lime, juiced 1/8 cup water 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt 2 eggs 4 egg whites Coarse salt and cracked black pepper 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 (6-inch) flour tortillas Instructions: For the salsa: Place all ingredients in food processor or blend and pulse until smooth.

Drizzle on the cookies and let set, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 70171,&quot;Corn Creme Brulee with Duck Prosciutto 2 cups heavy cream 1/3 of a fresh vanilla bean 3 egg yolks 1/8 cup sugar 26 ounces corn pudding, recipe follows Pinch salt 1 3/4 teaspoons sugar 42 medium-sized arugula leaves, cleaned and with stems removed 35 thin slices duck proscuitto <em>see note Chopped chives 1 tablespoon pure olive oil 1 1/2 cups chopped red onion 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced ginger 1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg 6 cups frozen corn kernels 1/2 cup white wine 2 cups milk 1/2 teaspoon salt Pinch freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To Finish: Put cream and vanilla bean in a saucepan over medium heat and scald. Place egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, and while whisking vigorously, slowly add 8 ounces of the hot cream mixture. Pour the yolks and cream mixture back into custard saucepan and return to high heat, whisking constantly for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the corn pudding, whisking to integrate all ingredients, and return to medium heat for 1 minute. At this point stop whisking and stir with a wooden spoon. Add a pinch of salt, to taste. Lower the heat to a simmer and let the foam calm down from whisking. Remove the vanilla bean and halve lengthwise. Scrape the vanilla seeds out of the pod and stir them into the custard. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place 7 shallow creme brulee tureens on a sheet tray and ladle the corn custard into the dishes (each dish should be about 4/5 full). Put the tray in the oven and add about 1/2-inch of water to the tray, creating a water bath. Bake for 40 minutes or until creme brulee is set to the consistency of custard. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat the broiler. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of sugar on top of each dish and put under broiler until sugar begins to brown and caramelizes. This should take about 1 minute, but watch closely so that the sugar doesn&#39;t burn. Remove from broiler and top with 6 arugula leaves and 5 slices of duck prosciutto on each serving. Sprinkle with chives. Warm a medium saucepan over high heat. Add oil, onion, garlic, ginger, nutmeg, and corn, stirring until the onions and corn has begun to brown. Stir in the wine and continue cooking over high heat until wine is absorbed. Add milk, salt, and pepper; bring to boil while stirring, then turn heat down and simmer for 5 minutes. Put mixture into a food processor in small batches and puree for about 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Take the pureed mixture and push it through a sieve or a strainer using a rubber spatula or the back of either a ladle or a large spoon. The goal is to strain out the skin of the corn kernels and onions in order to get as smooth a pudding as possible, so there&#39;s no break in texture between the pudding and the custard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70172,&quot;Prime Rib with Red Wine-Thyme Butter Sauce 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup fresh thyme leaves<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 12- to 14-pound prime rib, trimmed of some excess fat 11 large cloves garlic, 8 whole and 3 chopped Canola oil, for brushing Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 shallots, chopped<br> 1 bottle Cabernet Sauvignon<br> Few splashes Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar<br> 4 cups homemade roasted chicken stock, warmed<br> 12 whole black peppercorns<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish Instructions: For the butter: Combine the butter and thyme in a food processor and process until smooth, then season with salt and pepper. Scrape the butter into a ramekin, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold and the flavors meld, at least 2 hours and up to 48 hours. For the prime rib: Remove the prime rib from the refrigerator 2 hours before roasting. Pat the surface dry with paper towels. Make 8 small slits over the surface of the fat cap and fill each slit with a whole garlic clove. Place the roast on a large cutting board, then brush with oil and season heavily with salt and pepper 15 minutes before roasting. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the roast, bone-side down (fat-side up), in a large roasting pan fitted with a rack. Roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting until a digital instant-read thermometer inserted into the center and ends of the meat registers 125 degrees F for medium-rare doneness, about 3 hours. Start checking the temperature after 2 hours. Transfer the meat to a cutting board with a juice groove. Pour off all but a few tablespoons of the fat from the pan, and place the roasting pan over two burners set to high heat. Add the shallots and the remaining 3 cloves chopped garlic, and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the wine and vinegar and cook until reduced by three-quarters, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and peppercorns, and bring to a boil. Cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Strain the sauce into a medium saucepan set over low heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced a bit further. Slowly whisk in the cold thyme butter and cook until the sauce thickens (do not boil or the sauce will break). Season with salt and pepper.

Remove the saucepan from the heat, and sprinkle the yeast over the the liquid. Sprinkle a pinch of the sugar over the top, and set aside without stirring until foamy, about 5 minutes. Then whisk in the butter and egg yolk. Whisk together the flour, remaining sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon until you have a thick and slightly sticky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Add the dough ball, turning to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough ball on the plastic and note the time. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl, and knead briefly to release excess air; re-form it into a ball, and return it to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap, and lay it on the dough. Cover the entire bowl tightly with the rest of the plastic, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to let the dough proof. For the filling: Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a small bowl, and remove all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the skillet. Return the skillet to medium heat. Whisk the flour into the bacon fat, and cook, whisking, until light brown, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the milk, and continue whisking until thickened, about 1 minute more. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl, add the egg yolk, Cheddar, chives, cooked bacon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and stir to combine. Let cool completely. (The filling will firm up a bit, but if it&#39;s too warm, it will be difficult to form the buns.) To fill and form the buns: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and press it flat. Roll it into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle, with a long edge facing you. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the side opposite you. Starting from the side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight roll. Lightly brush the 1-inch border with water, and continue rolling to seal the roll. Fold the ends in just a bit, and if any spots look thicker than others, even out the roll with your hands. Cut the roll every 1 1/2 inches with a serrated knife, to make 12 buns. Place the buns cut-side down (except for the end pieces) in the prepared pan, spacing them 1 inch apart. Cover the buns loosely with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place to rise until the buns double in size, leaving no gaps in between, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. For the topping: Stir the butter, chives and Parmesan in a small bowl; set aside. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns until they&#39;re golden brown and the tops spring back when pressed lightly, 25 to 30 minutes. Spread the topping evenly over the buns, and return them to the oven for 5 minutes more. Let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70177,&quot;Hottie Sangria 3 1/4 cups rioja (Spanish red wine) 3 1/4 cups white wine 1 cup brandy 1 orange, sliced 1 cup frozen cherries 1 cup frozen peaches 2 cinnamon sticks, plus 1 for each glass for garnish 1/2 cup simple syrup</em> Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a slow cooker.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the softened cream cheese, sour cream, ricotta cheese, lime juice, 2 cups sugar substitute, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup hot water, and zest of 1 lime on medium speed until well combined. Using a fork to mix, thoroughly dissolve the 3 envelopes of gelatin in 3/4 cup boiling water. Do not let cool and move onto the next step immediately. (It is important that the water be boiling hot and that you mix the gelatin powder in quickly so it is completely dissolved. If not, you will have gummy bear-type lumps.) With the mixer on high and working very quickly so the gelatin does not set, blend the hot dissolved gelatin thoroughly into cheesecake mixture. Immediately pour mixture into the prepared pie pan and sprinkle with the zest of the other lime. Chill in the refrigerator for about 3 to 4 hours or until firm.

Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is very liquid about 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk the blueberry and sugar mixture into it. Return everything to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over low heat, until the mixture comes to a boil, thickens and becomes clear. If it does not become clear, continue to cook over low heat for a few more minutes, until it does. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the remaining filling ingredients, except the blueberries, then add the remaining 3 cups blueberries. Cool.<br> Set a rack at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.<br> Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in pan. Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Prepare a lattice top crust. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush it with egg wash. If you wish, sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar. Place the pie in the oven on the lower rack and reduce the temperature to 375 degrees. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is baked through and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently bubbling. If the top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30 minutes of baking, move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10 minutes. Cool the pie on a rack. To mix the dough by hand, combine the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and stir well to combine. Cut the butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to the dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat the pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Occasionally reach down to the bottom of the bowl and mix all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visable. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter mixture. Stir in with a fork until the dough begins to hold together but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. To mix the dough in the food processor, combine the dry ingredients in the work bowl fitted with a metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut the butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to the work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal, and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all. Add the eggs to the work bowl and pulse 10 times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. Press the dough into two equal-sized disks. Sandwich the disks of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press them into 6-inch circles. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70190,&quot;Wild Berry Freeze Cocktail 2 ounces raspberry Schnapps 1-ounce raspberry vodka Splash of grenadine Splash of ginger ale Ice cubes Fresh raspberries, for garnish Instructions: Combine Schnapps, vodka, and a splash of grenadine and ginger ale over ice.

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Place the beef in large pan or roaster, fat-side up. Salt and pepper liberally. Put 1-inch water in the bottom of the pan and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 12 hours. Remove the beef from the pan and place on a large cutting board. Try to use one with a drip well. Allow the beef to rest at least 30 minutes so that the juices will redistribute. Set aside the juices to cool and reserve for the gravy. The roast will be super tender and all will become debris. Be sure to remove all fat, veins and tendons. All leftovers can be frozen for later use. Separate the beef fat from the juices. Place about half of the fat in a heavy-bottomed saucepot and melt with a low heat. Freeze the remainder for later use. Use just enough flour to soak up the fat. You are now making a roux. Allow the flour to cook, stirring continually, to brown slightly. Add salt and pepper. Careful, you can always add salt. Add about half of the juice from the beef and stir. This will thicken. Adjust as needed. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.

Add the kosher salt, peppercorns and garlic; remove from heat. Let cool 30 minutes, then transfer to a large pot or ice chest lined with a large garbage bag. Add another 8 cups water, then add the wings and twist the bag closed. Refrigerate for 4 hours. Mix all the rub ingredients in a resealable plastic bag. Drain the wings. Rinse under cool water, pat very dry and put in the bag with the rub. Mix to coat evenly. Seal the bag and refrigerate until ready to cook. (You can do this a day ahead.) Preheat the broiler. Remove the wings from the bag and place in a single layer on a lightly oiled foil-lined pan. Broil for 8 minutes, then turn and cook for an additional 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Meanwhile, combine all the ingredients for the salsa, except the olive oil, in a food processor, using salt to taste. Slowly add the oil and puree until smooth. Serve the wings with the salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 70208,&quot;Aioli 2 or 3 fresh garlic cloves, peeled and chopped. (If they&#39;ve started to sprout, don&#39;t use them for aioli.) Large pinch coarse sea or kosher salt 1 egg yolk, at room temperature 1/2 lemon, juiced 2/3 cup pure olive oil (not extra virgin) 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place garlic and salt in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, or in a blender. Pulse for 2 seconds. Add the egg yolk and lemon juice, and pulse on and off until blended. Turn on and begin adding the olive oil (pure first, then extra-virgin) in a thin stream. If it becomes too thick, thin it out with some room-temperature water and continue adding oil until you&#39;ve used it all. Finish with pepper and (if necessary) a bit more salt. The reason for using 2/3 pure olive oil is to keep the flavor of the oil from becoming overpowering. This is a perfect example of how by using a fully-flavored extra virgin oil you can use much less, thereby saving money and getting better flavor. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 70209,&quot;Sausage, Clam and Calamari Saute Extra-virgin olive oil, for cooking 1 cup ground spicy sausage<br> 1 pound small fresh clams in their shells<br> 1/4 cup white wine<br> 1 tablespoon liquid aminos, preferably Bragg<br> 2 cups favorite jarred tomato sauce 1 cup fresh calamari, full tentacles and bodies cut into 1/2-inch rings<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br> Instructions: Heat a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, and coat the bottom with olive oil.

Whisk the flour, sugar, yeast and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the egg but don&#39;t stir it in yet. Heat the milk and coconut oil in a saucepan until a thermometer reads 110 degrees F. (If the milk is too hot when you add it to the flour mixture, it will kill the yeast.) Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture. Avoid pouring it directly on the egg-you don&#39;t want the hot milk to cook it. Using the dough hook, mix on medium speed until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, if needed. The dough will look a little irregular in texture. Knead the dough. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, soft and elastic, 3 to 4 minutes. Shape into a ball and place in a large bowl lightly oiled with coconut oil; rub the top of the dough with a little more coconut oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Form the muffins. Sprinkle 2 baking sheets with cornmeal and set aside. After the dough rises, punch it down and divide into 16 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then flatten into a 3-inch disk. Place the disks on the baking sheets. Cook the muffins. Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the skillet with cooking spray and liberally sprinkle with cornmeal. Working in batches, cook the muffins until they are deep golden brown, 5 to 9 minutes per side. If they start to rise in a domed fashion, flatten them with a spatula. Let the English muffins cool completely, then split open, toast and serve with butter and jam. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70211,&quot;Castagnaccio: Chestnut Flour Cake 14 ounces/400 g chestnut flour 2 tablespoons/30 ml sugar Pinch salt 2 cups/1/2 l water 4 tablespoons/60 ml extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup/125 ml raisins 1/2 cup/125 ml pine nuts Sprig fresh rosemary Zest of 1 orange Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the white wine and stir to combine. Stir in the mustard, paprika, and salt and pepper. Gradually add the cheeses, reserving about 1/4 cup of each cheese for the top of the casserole. Stir the sauce thoroughly between each addition of the cheese. Simmer until the cheese is well blended. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the elbow macaroni and cook to al dente. Drain. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large casserole dish (or in numerous smaller dishes) add a 1/2-inch of the warm cheese sauce. Fill the casserole with the drained elbow macaroni. Top with another layer of cheese sauce, covering the macaroni completely and sprinkle with the reserved cheese. Bake the macaroni until the top is brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the casserole dish. Remove from the oven and serve hot. In a small saucepan over low heat, add the onion and 1/2 cup of butter and saute until very soft, but do not brown. In another saucepan, scald the milk. Stir the sauteed onions into the milk along with the salt, pepper and nutmeg. Make a blonde roux by mixing the remaining 1/2 cup butter and the flour in a small bowl.

Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Mix in the oregano, thyme, salt and pepper. Cut the block of tofu horizontally in half. Then cut it in half the long way. Make 5 cuts perpendicular to the long cut, creating 24 pieces. Cover a sheet pan with paper towels. Place the tofu in one layer on the towels. Blot the tofu, pressing it gently with additional towels to remove excess moisture. Heat the oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F. Cover a second baking sheet with more paper towels. Place the beaten eggs in a wide, shallow dish. Dip the tofu in the egg. Dredge the pieces in the bread crumb mixture until completely coated. Slip the breaded tofu into the hot oil, 3 or 4 pieces at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from pan using a slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately, accompanied by the Honey Mustard for dipping. Or, let the sticks cool and arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Cover with foil and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Before serving, recrisp by baking in a 350 degree F oven for about 12 minutes. Puree the tofu in a food processor. Add the mustard, honey, sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, dry mustard, and salt. Process until well blended. The finished dipping sauce will have the texture of runny mayonnaise. Turn the sauce into a container, cover, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours. This gives the ingredients time to meld and their flavors to develop. Chilling thickens the sauce to a spreadable texture. Stirring brings it back to the texture of a dip or a thick sauce.

With a meat mallet or a rolling pin, pound the chicken cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap to 1/8-inch thickness. Season the cutlets with salt and pepper and press the seasonings into the meat with your fingers. Make the coating: Combine the bread crumbs, cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Work in the olive oil by hand, then spread the mixture on a dinner plate. Spread the flour on another dinner plate. Break the eggs into a shallow bowl and beat lightly. Dip the cutlets in the flour, coating both sides and shaking off the excess. Then dip in the egg, letting any excess drip back into the bowl. Finally, coat the cutlets on both sides with the seasoned bread crumbs, pressing them into place. As each cutlet is coated, place it on a tray. Cover the cutlets and refrigerate until you are ready to fry them. Heat a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add olive oil to a depth of 1/4-inch. When the oil is almost smoking, add as many cutlets as the skillet will hold comfortably; do not crowd the pan. Cook until the cutlets are golden on the bottom, about 1 minute. Turn and cook on the second side about 30 seconds to 1 minute longer. With tongs, lift the cutlets as they are done, allowing any excess oil to drain back into the skillet, and transfer to cookie sheet lined with paper bag to drain excess oil. Repeat with the remaining cutlets. When ready to serve, place chicken cutlets on cookie sheet to finish cooking, about 2 minutes. Place the arugula in a large bowl. Drizzle with enough extra-virgin olive oil to coat the leaves lightly. Add a squeeze of lemon and some salt and pepper. Toss, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Divide the cutlets among 4 plates, placing them in the center. Spoon a little Salsa Rosa on each side of the cutlets. Mound the arugula salad on top. With a vegetable peeler, shave a little Parmesan on top of the salad. Michael&#39;s Notes: If you like my version of Chicken Milanese, and I know you will, try the same method on pounded veal, turkey breasts or on very thin swordfish steaks. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Brush the bell peppers lightly with olive oil and place on the baking sheet. Bake, turning every 10 to 15 minutes, until the peppers are blistered all over, about 30 minutes total. Transfer the peppers to a brown paper bag, and close tightly so they steam as they cool. You can roast the peppers under the broiler or over a gas flame, if you prefer, but I like to do them in a hot oven. It takes a little longer, but you don&#39;t have to monitor them as closely. While peppers are steaming, heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over high heat. Add the whole chiles, lower the heat to moderate, and cook, turning occasionally, until the chiles are softened, lightly browned, and blistered on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the chilies cool in the oil for several minutes. When cool enough to handle, remove the stems. Add more oil to the skillet, if needed, to make 2 tablespoons. Reheat the oil over moderate heat and add the garlic. Cook until lightly browned, about 30 seconds, then add the oregano and saute briefly to release its fragrance. Add the tomato puree and salt, bring to a simmer, and simmer for about 5 minutes to thicken slightly. Remove peppers from bag, peel and remove the stems, seeds, and ribs; avoid the temptation to rinse the peppers, which would wash away flavor. You should have about 4 cups. Combine the red peppers, serrano chiles, and tomato sauce in a blender and puree until smooth. Add the vinegar and the black pepper to taste and puree again. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 4 months. Yield: about 4 cups &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Montepulciano, Pinot Noir]&quot; 70224,&quot;Turtle Soup 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 12 coffee beans, crushed 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup caramel sauce, recipe follows 8 scoops butter pecan ice cream 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/3 cup water 2/3 cup heavy cream Instructions: Put the chopped chocolate in a mixing bowl. Put the half-and-half and coffee beans in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Pour over the chopped chocolate and whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the corn syrup and vanilla and whisk together. Pour through a strainer into a serving pitcher. If you&#39;re not serving immediately, chill until serving. (The recipe can be made up to this point and kept refrigerated up to 2 days in advance.) When ready to serve, heat the caramel sauce in the microwave. Heat the pitcher of chocolate soup in the microwave. Put a scoop of butter pecan ice cream in each of 8 serving bowls and drizzle with caramel sauce. At the table, pour the hot chocolate soup around the ice cream. Caramel Sauce: Pour the sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the walls of the pan, trying not to splash any sugar onto the walls. Do not stir; gently draw your finger twice through the center of the sugar, making a cross, to moisten it. Over high heat, bring to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pan occasionally to even out the color, until medium caramel in color, 5 to 10 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat and use a wooden spoon to slowly and carefully stir in the cream (it will bubble up and may splatter). Set aside. If the sauce has cooled, rewarm it over low heat (or in a microwave) until softened. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 70225,&quot;Slow Cooker Moroccan Brisket with Red Onions and Apricot Couscous 1 large red onion, sliced into thin wedges 2 parsnips, chopped 2 pound boneless beef brisket Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons ground coriander 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Pinch nutmeg 1 cup whole dried apricots 1 cup dry red wine 1/2 cup reduced-sodium beef broth 2 tablespoons honey 1 cup couscous 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Arrange onion wedges and parsnips in bottom of slow cooker.

Place the pig&#39;s foot in the center of the pan, with the smaller part of the foot down. Place the tomatoes along 1 side of the foot and the mushrooms along the other. Pour the pork stock and mushroom juice over the pig&#39;s foot and place the pan on the top rack of the oven. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, basting every 3 minutes, until the skin is crisp and golden and the center is hot (approximately 145 degrees F). Once the pig&#39;s foot is ready, place it on a plate and cut the butcher&#39;s twine. Serve with boiled potatoes, if desired. While you are doing this, let sauce cook over a high flame until slightly reduced. Add the vinaigrette base, salt, pepper, and haricots verts and stir to combine. Once you have added the vinaigrette, remove from heat or the emulsification will break. Dress the pig&#39;s foot with the sauce and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Rinse the pig&#39;s foot under cold running water for 10 minutes and dry thoroughly. Use a spoon to stuff half of the pig&#39;s foot with the Stuffing. Liberally salt the foie gras and place it inside the pig&#39;s foot. Add the rest of the stuffing and pack tightly. Thread the butcher&#39;s twine through the needle and heat the tip of the needle over the candle; the hot needle will pass through the fat and skin more easily. Sew the pig&#39;s foot shut, tying it off at 1 end and then the other.<br> Bring the poaching liquid to a boil, add the pig&#39;s foot, and turn off the flame. Poach for 10 minutes or until pig&#39;s foot feels firm to the touch. Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it begins to haze. Add 1 tablespoon of pork fat and the mushrooms, making sure mushrooms are in 1 even layer. Let the mushrooms sit in the pan, without movement, for 30 seconds or until a nice golden color forms. Toss the mushrooms and repeat until nicely colored. Sprinkle with salt and cook for 30 more seconds. Pour mushrooms into a sieve set over a plastic container and set aside. Deglaze the pan with a splash of water or white wine and pour over the mushrooms.<br> Reheat the pan over medium heat and add the rest of the pork fat. Add onions and rosemary, stirring constantly so as not to form any color. Sweat the onions until they become soft and translucent. At this point, add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Then add cubed pork meat and toss lightly until everything is combined; make sure the meat does not fall apart or you will lose some texture in the stuffing. Once everything is combined, add pig foot meat, season with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low. As the collagen in the foot meat begins to melt, add the reserved porcini mushrooms, reserving the liquid for the sauce. Stir occasionally until everything is combined and evenly seasoned. Transfer stuffing to a plate and place in the refrigerator to cool completely. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.<br> Using a boning knife, peel the skin of the shank away from the meat until you reach the ankle. Use a saw or a cleaver to cut the bone at the ankle. Place the pig&#39;s foot and shank in a deep pan with the pork stock, carrot, onion, celery, garlic, thyme, and peppercorns and place in oven. Cook for 3 to 4 hours or until the meat is falling off the bone. Once cooked, pull the shank meat off the bone and reserve. Discard the bone. Pull the skin off the pig&#39;s foot and remove all of the bone, reserving the meat and discarding the bone. Put the mustard, vinegar, and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk until frothy. Slowly drizzle in half of the oil while whisking constantly. Drizzle in the water and then the remaining oil, while still whisking rapidly.

For the chimichangas: Pour the marinade over the steak in a shallow baking dish and let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours. Bring the steak to room temperature before cooking. When the steak is almost ready, heat 1 of the tablespoons oil and the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, green and red peppers and a pinch of salt and cook until tender and slightly charred, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Transfer the steak from the marinade to a plate. Generously sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Preheat the remaining tablespoon oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the steak and cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium doneness, or until the desired level of doneness is reached. Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice the steak against the grain or dice it into small pieces, if you prefer. For the assembly: Place a tortilla on a work surface. Place a few slices of steak in the center, followed by 1/2 cup of the onions and peppers. Fold up the sides of the tortilla and then roll up from the bottom to form a tight burrito. Skewer the edges with toothpicks to hold them together. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, steak, and onions and peppers. Add enough oil to a deep, heavy skillet to come about 1 inch up the side and heat over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, carefully add the burritos in 2 batches. Cook on both sides until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer the chimichangas to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet to drain. Remove the toothpicks from the chimichangas, sprinkle with the cilantro and serve with Queso Cheese Sauce. Place the cheese, milk, chilies, butter and House Seasoning in a saucepan. Heat, stirring often, over medium heat until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, stir in more milk 1 tablespoon at a time. Season with salt, if needed. Stir together the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper in a small bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 70238,&quot;Apricot Jam 2 pounds pitted, quartered apricots 1 3/4 cups sugar Zest of 1 lemon plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Toss the apricots, sugar, lemon zest and juice and vanilla in a large saucepan to combine, then mash slightly to release some of the apricot juice. Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the apricots to macerate and the sugar to dissolve. Meanwhile, place a small plate in the freezer to chill; this will be used to test the doneness of the jam. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat. (See Cook&#39;s Note for suggested add-in.) Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium, stirring frequently. Continue to cook until the jam becomes thick and syrupy, about 35 minutes. To test doneness, place a small amount of the jam onto the chilled plate and freeze for 2 minutes. Drag your finger or a spoon through the jam. If it holds its shape and thickness, the jam is done; remove from the heat. If it&#39;s runny, continue to cook and test again in 5-minute increments. Once the jam has reached the right consistency, transfer to jars and cool completely before storing, tightly covered.

When the oil is hot, add the onions and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, another 2 minutes. Add half of the mustard greens, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the greens are wilted and reduced in volume by half, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining greens and season with more salt and pepper; cook again until the greens are wilted and evenly incorporated with the onions and garlic. Add the chicken stock, vinegar and ham hock to the pot and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low, cover, and cook at a slow simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring halfway through. The greens are done when the stock has almost completely reduced and the ham hocks are tender when pierced with a pairing knife. Remove the ham hocks to a cutting board and pull the meat from the bone with two forks. Discard any fat and skin, and then stir the shredded meat back into the greens.

Line bottom of pan with waxed or parchment paper so that the paper overhangs the pan at two opposite ends. Heat milk with butter in small saucepan over medium heat until butter melts. Reduce heat to low and keep hot but do not simmer. Sift flour with baking powder twice. Return to sifter and set aside. In a large heatproof bowl, use a hand-held whisk to combine sugar, eggs and yolks. Set bowl over or in a pan of barely simmering water. Warm the mixture, whisking occasionally, until it is lukewarm to the touch. (Alternatively, omit the water bath and hold the bowl directly over the stove burner, whisking vigorously for about a minute until the eggs are warm. This is the quickest, easiest method but you must whisk the eggs continuously to keep them from starting to scramble). Transfer bowl to electric mixer; beat at high speed until mixture has cooled, tripled in volume and has the consistency of thick whipped cream. Sift one-third of flour mixture over batter and fold it gently, by hand, using the largest rubber spatula you have. Fold in half the remaining flour; then fold in the remaining flour. Pour hot milk and butter into batter and fold well, scraping the bottom each time and bringing the batter up the sides of the bowl until you can no longer see traces of liquid. Transfer batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until cake is browned, starts to shrink from the sides of pan, and springs back when lightly pressed: about 10 minutes. Cool cake in pan, on a rack. When cake is cool, run a small knife or spatula around the edges to release before unmolding.

Poke the flesh side all over with the tip of a paring knife. Put the fennel seeds and peppercorns in a small dry skillet; toast over medium heat until very fragrant and a few shades darker, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool, then grind in a spice grinder. Mix the ground spices with the red pepper flakes, sage, rosemary, thyme, lemon zest, orange zest, garlic and 2 tablespoons salt. Rub the mixture into the flesh side of the pork belly. Roll the belly up as tightly as possible and secure it with kitchen twine at 1-inch intervals. Rub the outside with the baking powder and 1 tablespoon salt. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 1 to 2 days. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Set the rolled pork belly in a large roasting pan and roast until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 hours.

Using the tip of a small, sharp knife, loosen the white membrane surrounding each segment and pull it away, trying not to pierce any of the little juice pods. Break up the segments into juice pods and set them aside. Trim the venison of any tendons or cartilage and slice across the grain into 1/2 inch slices. Place each one between 2 layers of plastic wrap and flatten by pounding with the flat side of a mallet until just over 1/4 inch thick. Season generously with salt and pepper. Preheat an oven to the lowest heat and place a heat proof platter inside. In a large, heavy skillet heat the olive oil over high heat (you may need to do this in batches). Quickly sear the venison scallops for about 1 minute on each side, then reduce the heat and cook for 1 minute more, until done to your liking (if the venison is cooked beyond the medium rare stage, it will be tough.) Transfer the scallops to the platter in the oven and cover loosely with a piece of aluminum foil. Wipe the skillet clean and, over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the shallots and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Add the gin and simmer until the pan is almost dry. Add the juniper berries, venison or beef stock, salt, and cracked pepper. Increase the heat to high and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Add the remaining pieces of cold butter, remove the pan from the heat, and whisk until the sauce is emulsified. Taste for seasoning and stir in the grapefruit pieces. Place one or 2 venison scallops on each plate and spoon some of the sauce over the top. Serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 70246,&quot;Cannoli Siciliani: Sicilian Cannoli 2 cups/457 g flour, plus extra for dusting if needed 2 tablespoons/28 g cocoa powder Pinch salt 2 tablespoons/28 g cold margarine 1/2 cup/118 ml white wine 1/4 cup/58 ml water Extra-virgin olive oil, for deep-frying 1 1/2 pound/680 g fresh sheep&#39;s milk ricotta cheese 1 cup/228 g sugar 1 cup/228 g grated bittersweet chocolate Candied fruit, finely sliced Icing sugar (confectioners&#39; sugar) Instructions: To make the cannoli shells: In large bowl, mix together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt and cut in the margarine until evenly blended. Then gradually work in the wine and water to form a compact dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for an hour. On a lightly-floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out 5-inch-wide circles and cover. Re-roll the scrap dough to form more circles. In a deep-fat fryer or heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Wrap each circle onto a mold, sealing the two edges that overlap with a dab of water and by pressing together. Carefully immerse a few shells at a time, into the hot oil and fry until golden and crisp. Drain the shells on paper towels, let cool and remove the molds from the cannoli. To make the filling: In a bowl, whip up the ricotta and sugar until creamy. Add the grated chocolate. Mix thoroughly. Using a piping bag, pipe the filling into each shell, starting at the middle and working out towards each end. Garnish the ends of each cannoli with sliced candied fruit and then dust the cannoli with icing sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 70247,&quot;Merzula en Salsa Verde (Hake in a Green Sauce) 2 1/4 pounds hake fillets, skin on Salt 1/3 cup olive oil 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped 1 tablespoon flour 1/2 cup clam broth or natural clam juice 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Carefully clean, rinse and pat dry the hake. Sprinkle the fillets lightly with salt.<br> Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy skillet. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic just begins to color, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over and mix thoroughly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of water, the clam broth or juice, wine, parsley and salt to taste. Decrease the heat to medium and cook the sauce, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thick or just barely coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. You can add more cold water to loosen up the sauce if necessary.<br> Add the hake to the pan, skin-side up, in a single layer. Cook the hake fillets in the sauce for 2 minutes, swirling the pan constantly and sliding the pan on and off the fire until the hake fillets give off some of their gelatin and emulsify with the rest of the sauce. Flip the hake fillets once and cook until the fish is opaque but not overcooked, another 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. The sauce should be very light green and slightly thick but still loose and light. Serve immediately.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Albari?o]&quot; 70248,&quot;Grilled Ribbons of Thai-Style Steak 1 flank steak (about 2 pounds), very cold (See Cook&#39;s Note.) 1/2 cup Thai Red Curry Paste, recipe follows 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk 1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon Southeast Asian fish sauce 1 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional) Spray oil Peanut Sauce, recipe follows 8 dried red chiles, like arbol, stemmed and seeded 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 1 teaspoon white peppercorns 1/4 cup packed roughly chopped coriander leaves, stems, and roots (cilantro) 2 tablespoons Southeast Asian fish sauce 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional) 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 medium fresh red chiles, stemmed and chopped 5 cloves garlic 3 shallots 2 fresh lemongrass stalks (about 6 ounces), trimmed and thinly sliced 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, like soy, peanut, or corn 2 tablespoons coconut cream skimmed from the top of canned coconut milk 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Thai Red Curry Paste, see above 1 cup chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk 1/4 cup chunky peanut butter 1 tablespoon Southeast Asian fish sauce 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice, or more to taste Instructions: Using a sharp knife, slice the steak, against the grain and on angle, into thin strips about an inch wide. In a large bowl, whisk together the paste, coconut milk, sugar, fish sauce, and turmeric, if using. Add the beef, mix well, and set aside at room temperature to marinate for at least 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill. Thread the beef onto skewers, then lightly spray them with oil. Working in batches grill the beef, over high heat until just cooked through, about 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the beef skewers to a serving platter and serve with the peanut sauce. Toast the dried chiles in a small dry skillet over medium-high heat until smoky and fragrant. Transfer to a medium bowl, cover with hot water, and set aside until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain and roughly chop the chiles. Toast the coriander, cumin seeds, and peppercorns in the skillet over medium-high heat until toasted and fragrant. Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly. Grind the spices in a spice mill (clean coffee grinder). In a food processor, combine the chiles, ground spices, and all of the ingredients, except for the oil, and puree into a paste. Gradually add the oil with the machine running, and puree until smooth. Store the paste in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Stir-fry the coconut cream in a small saucepan over medium heat, until the oil separates and sizzles, about 2 minutes. Add the curry paste and stir-fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the broth, coconut milk, peanut butter, and fish sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl and cool to room temperature. Whisk in the lime juice just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Grenache]&quot; 70249,&quot;Wasabi Broiled Black Cod 1 cup mayonnaise or egg-free mayonnaise, such as Vegenaise 2 teaspoons wasabi paste Vegetable oil, for the broiler pan 4 fillets sustainable black cod or other firm white fish 1 ripe avocado Salt 1 lime, cut in half Instructions: Position an oven rack in the upper third of the oven. Heat the broiler. Mix the mayonnaise and the wasabi paste in a small bowl. Brush a broiler pan with vegetable oil and place the fish on the pan. Slather the wasabi mayonnaise evenly over the top of the fish. Broil until the fish is firm and the tops are deep golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Halve, pit and peel the avocado, then cut into 12 thin wedges. Season with salt and squeeze the lime juice over the avocado.

Pour over salmon halves in a 3-inch deep pan. Marinate, chilled, in the brine mixture for 4 to 8 hours. Remove from brine and pat dry. Brush the salmon with oil. Season with wild fennel pollen, salt, and pepper. Place on Alder plank and soak in cold water overnight. Sometimes a nail through the tail end is used to hold the salmon in place. Lean the plank against an Alder wood fire that has mostly died down to very hot coals. Be careful not to let the plank catch fire. The heat and the smoke from the fire will cook and season the salmon. Serve right off the plank. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 70251,&quot;Passatelli 3 whole eggs Nutmeg, to taste 1 lemon, zested 4 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 4 ounces bread crumbs Salt, to taste 1 quart broth (either chicken, meat or vegetable) Instructions: Mix 3 eggs in a ceramic bowl. Add nutmeg and lemon zest. Beat this mixture with a wire whip. Add the cheese and the bread crumbs (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add salt to taste. Heat the broth. While boiling, strain the dough using a strainer with large holes (3/8 of an inch diameter) directly into the boiling broth and lower the flame to avoid breakage which can occur from water that is boiling very rapidly. If you wish to save any leftovers, take a flat dish and sprinkle it with some bread crumbs and a pinch of flour. Place the Passatelli on it, cover with plastic wrap and freeze immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Chianti Classico, Tempranillo]&quot; 70252,&quot;Pork Tenderloin with Lemon and Fennel 3 tablespoons lemon olive oil, recipe follows, or olive oil 2 garlic cloves, mashed to a paste with 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest 2 teaspoons fennel seeds, coarsely ground 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 pork tenderloins (1 1/2 pounds total) trimmed 1 fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into long thin strips 1 garlic clove, minced 1 teaspoon sugar 3/4 cup cool water 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil, or other vegetable oil 2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest Instructions: Combine 1 tablespoon of the lemon oil, garlic paste, zest, fennel seeds, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub the mixture over the pork tenderloins and let stand at room temperature, covered, for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown the pork tenderloins, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a baking pan and roast the pork for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until an inserted instant read thermometer reads 150 degrees F, about 15 to 20 minutes, for medium, or to desired doneness. Remove the pork to a platter and let sit for 10 minutes before cutting into thin slices. Variation: If you&#39;d like to serve fresh fennel alongside the pork, after browning the pork, add the fennel to the same skillet. Cook the fennel, stirring frequently, over medium heat until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add a minced garlic clove, a teaspoon of sugar and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add 3/4 cup cool water, bring to a boil and simmer until the liquid is all evaporated and the fennel is fork-tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Place the oil and the zest in a glass jar. Let stand at room temperature for at least 2 weeks, shaking occasionally. Pour the oil through a strainer and discard the zest. Transfer to a jar and store, tightly covered, at in refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 70253,&quot;Nacho Bread Pizzas 1 loaf baguette or semolina bread, day old is fine 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped or 1 pickled hot pepper of any kind, chopped 1 (15-ounce) can black beans 2 teaspoons hot sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin Salt and pepper 1 cup prepared salsa, any variety 2 cups shredded Cheddar, smoked Cheddar, Monterey Jack or pepper Jack 1 heart romaine or 1/2 iceberg head, shredded 1/2 cup green olives with or without pimiento, chopped 1/4 red onion or 2 to 3 scallions, chopped 2 plum or vine tomatoes, seeded and diced Instructions: Split bread lengthwise.

Lay out one sheet of phyllo and brush all over with some of the melted butter. Lay another sheet crosswise on top and brush with butter again. Working to form a large round of phyllo layers, lay an additional 6 sheets of phyllo dough diagonally over the first 2 sheets, brushing each sheet with butter, so they overlap in the center. Spread the filling in the center of the sheets and bring all the loose ends of the phyllo to rest on top to make a free-form pie, using the butter to help the pieces stick to each other. Lay 4 of the remaining 6 sheets of phyllo evenly over the top of the pie, tucking the edges under the bottom to form an enclosed disk and brushing each piece of dough with butter. Use the last 2 sheets, if necessary, to cover the filling or enclose the circle. Brush the outside of the pie with butter.</li><li>Lift the parchment with the pie onto a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the phyllo is golden brown and crispy, about 40 minutes.

Add the butter and pulse until thoroughly combined. Add the egg yolk and Marsala and process until the dough forms a ball. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Fill a large, wide pot with 2 inches of oil and heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, lightly flour a work surface and roll the dough out into a thin circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out as many circles as possible with a 3 1/2- to 4-inch round cookie cutter, then gather the scraps, reroll, and cut out more (discard any remaining scraps). Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Wrap a circle of dough around a cannoli tube. Lightly moisten an edge with water and press the edges together very firmly to seal (if not well-sealed, the cannoli shells will open while frying). Repeat with as many cannoli tubes as you have. Fry the tubes with the dough, turning once, until the shells are golden brown all over, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully remove the tubes from the oil and slip off the cannoli shells onto the paper towels. Let the tubes cool slightly, then repeat until all of the dough is fried, adjusting the heat as necessary to keep the oil at 350 degrees F. Cool the shells completely. For the filling: Mix the ricotta, confectioners&#39; sugar, orange zest and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the chocolate. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch tip with the ricotta mixture. Hold a cannoli shell in one hand; with the other, insert the pastry tip into the center of the shell and pipe out the filling. Turn the shell around and fill the other side. Repeat with the remaining shells and filling. Arrange on a platter and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve filled shells immediately; alternatively, store unfilled shells in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days and fill when ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70257,&quot;Red Velvet Cheesecake Brownies Cooking spray 12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/3 cup sugar 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon red gel food coloring 1 tablespoon buttermilk 2 sticks unsalted butter 1 3/4 cups sugar 3 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder Instructions: Make the cheesecake layer: Preheat the oven to 350?.

In a small bowl, toss together 1 rounded teaspoon of salt, garam masala, cumin and some freshly ground black pepper to taste. Add the sweet potatoes to a large bowl, drizzle with enough olive oil to coat, and sprinkle with the spice rub. Toss well to coat evenly. Pour the sweet potatoes out onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet or a baking rack, making sure all the pieces are evenly spaced. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove the potatoes from the baking sheet and serve immediately. Combine the cinnamon sticks, cloves, green cardamom seeds, black cardamom seeds, if using, in a spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind until fine.

Brush 3 (12 1/2 by 9-inch) rimmed baking sheets (otherwise known as quarter sheet pans) with melted butter. Line the pans with parchment paper, leaving a few inches of overhang on opposite sides. Butter the top of the parchment paper as well, then set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the almond paste and sugar on medium speed until well combined, about 5 minutes. Add the almond extract. Roughly cut the room temperature butter into pats and gradually add to the almond paste-sugar mixture. Beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating to combine after each addition. Add the flour and salt and beat until just combined. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared baking sheets, about 2 1/4 cups each sheet, smoothing the batter out with an offset spatula. Gently tap the baking sheet on the table to remove any air pockets in the batter. Air pockets will cause holes in the baked cake and give a ragged look to the finished product. Bake until just set, but not browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Give the baking sheets a turn halfway through baking, after about 8 minutes, for even baking, if needed, but don&#39;t worry too much because we&#39;re covering the cakes. Test with a toothpick or skewer and if clean, remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool. To make the jam easier to spread and to prevent tearing the cake, puree the raspberry jam in a food processor. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn 1 cake layer out onto the lined baking sheet. Spread half of the raspberry jam in an even layer over the cake. Carefully flip the cake out of the baking sheet and top with a second cake layer. Spread with the remaining jam. Carefully flip the final layer out of the baking sheet and top the cake. Place a piece of parchment paper over the final layer and top with a second baking sheet. Weigh down with 2 large (28-ounce) cans. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and cut into 1-inch squares. Place onto a wire racks over at least 2 baking sheets, leaving at least 1-inch between each cake piece. Place each of the tinted royals icings in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, with the bottom of the bowl not touching the water, until pourable. You should have about 8 cups total. You&#39;ll be using about 1 heaping tablespoon icing on each. Carefully place a cut cake on a chocolate fork/dipper (or a small fork). Place the cake over the icing and spoon the icing onto the cake. If the cake drops into the icing, carefully pick it up with your spoon and place back onto your fork/dipper. Place back onto the wire rack using another dipper or fork to slide onto the wire rack. Top with decorative dragees, as desired. Repeat with the remaining icing and cakes. Alternately, for each tinted frosting, set 3 cooling racks over baking sheets and divide the cut cake pieces evenly among the racks. Pour the tinted frosting slowly over the cake pieces. If you need extra frosting, just remove the cooling rack, scrape the excess frosting from the baking sheet, melt or microwave until pourable and touch up any area that the frosting didn&#39;t coat the first time. Let stand until set, about 30 minutes at room temperature or cover and place in the refrigerator for up to 1 week until ready to serve. Put your raspberries and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan over medium heat. Once it&#39;s at a simmer, partially cover and cook 8 to 10 minutes. Pass the berry mixture through a food mill and measure the liquid that remains. You need 3 1/2 cups. Add more water if there isn&#39;t enough. Put the berry liquid into a new saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer again. Once it simmers, start adding your sugar in 1/2 cup increments. Give it a stir to incorporate and bring it back to a simmer before adding of the next 1/2 cup sugar. Once the last 1/2 cup is added, bring the liquid to 216 to 218 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Stir constantly. Let this cool to room temperature prior to using. If not using right away, refrigerate for up to 1 week. Yield: 2 cups. In a large heatproof bowl, combine 1 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon water, corn syrup and almond extract. Once incorporated, slowly whisk in the sugar until fully combined. Alternately, slowly mix together in a stand mixer and transfer to a heatproof bowl prior to icing cakes. Divide the icing into 3 heatproof bowls.

Add the shallots, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring, until the shallots just begin to color, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms, thyme, and the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms release their liquid, about 2 minutes. Add the Chicken Reduction, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by half and has a saucy consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the preserved truffles (if using). If the mixture thickens too much -- you want the mushrooms to be swimming in the sauce but there should be a mushroom in every bite -- add 2 tablespoons of the Chicken Reduction to thin it out a bit. Stir in the chives and crushed red pepper. Divide the Creamy Polenta among serving bowls. Top with the mushrooms and their cooking liquid and serve immediately. Heat a convection oven to 425 degrees F or a conventional oven to 450 degrees F. Rinse the chicken bones and pat them dry. Spread them out on two rimmed baking sheets in a single layer with a little room between the bones. Roast until golden brown, about 1 hour, flipping and turning the bones every 15 minutes or so. In a large stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the rosemary and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the celery, onion, and carrot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are well browned, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, and cook, stirring, until some of the juices evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and cook until almost all of it has evaporated. Add the chicken bones (with juices and drippings) to the stockpot, then add enough water to cover everything by about 2 inches (about 6 quarts). Increase the heat to medium-high, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium to cook at a gentle simmer, stirring often to break up the bones and emulsify the fat, until the chicken is falling off the bones and the stock has a full flavor, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the chicken bones and strain the broth several times through a chinois or other fine-mesh strainer. If you want to make and use the reduction right away, spoon off any visible fat floating on top of the stock. Otherwise, chill the stock until the fat solidifies on top, and then scrape off and discard most of it. Pour the defatted stock into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat slightly so the stock is not boiling so furiously. As the stock simmers, some of it will remain on the sides of the saucepan; use a spoon or ladle to pour some of the stock over this to deglaze it. (This will further increase the intensity of the flavor.) Continue simmering until the stock has darkened, thickened, and reduced to about 4 cups, about 30 minutes. The reduction can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Yield: 4 cups In a large, heavy-based saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the cream and milk until warm, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the salt and keep whisking until the liquid is very frothy (like a cappuccino) and hot. While still whisking, slowly rain the polenta into the pot. Continue to whisk until the granules swell, about 8 minutes. At this point, switch to a wooden spoon to stir the polenta. (It will get too thick for the whisk.) Keep stirring until the polenta has begun to thicken, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium and cook until it evenly begins to bubble. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and cook, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes, until cooked through and the liquid has reduced, about 1 1/2 hours. The polenta might look \\done\\ sooner, but it does continue to soften, so be patient. During this time, a skin might form on the bottom of the pan, which is fine. Just before serving, raise the heat to medium-high, stir in the butter and the cheese, and cook, stirring, until the butter is melted, then take the pot off the heat. If the polenta looks thin, don&#39;t worry, as it will thicken as it cools. Yield: 8 to 10 servings &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barolo]&quot; 70270,&quot;Miso Maple Roasted Root Vegetables 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons miso paste<br> 2 tablespoons maple syrup<br> 1 tablespoon soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons sesame seeds<br> Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 3 large carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 3 large parsnips, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 1 large fennel bulb, sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Stir in the sugar until dissolved, then sprinkle the yeast onto the surface of the water. Let the yeast sit undisturbed for 1 minute, then stir it into the water until blended. Let the yeast \\proof\\ for 10 minutes; it should become bubbly because of the presence of sugar. If it doesn=t bubble, it is outdated and inactive. Pour the yeast mixture into a large bowl. Mix in the remaining cup of water, the olive oil, and salt. Add the flour and semolina and stir with a wooden spoon until a ball of dough forms. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 minutes, flouring the work surface as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. Lightly oil a large ceramic or glass bowl. Place the dough inside, then flip it over so the oiled side is on top. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise until double in bulk, about 11 1/2 hours. Meanwhile make the topping. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add the onions. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are golden brown all over, about 20 minutes. Mix in the mushrooms and cook until they are brown and juicy, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and season the mushrooms with the thyme, salt, and pepper. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. If you are using a pizza stone heat it at least 45 minutes before cooking the pizza on it. Punch down the dough and dump it onto your work surface. Divide it into 3. Lightly flour the work surface, then with a rolling pin, roll one portion of the dough into an 11inch circle. If you are using a pizza stone, then sprinkle some cornmeal onto a pizza peel and place the disk of dough on it; otherwise, lightly grease a baking sheet and place the dough on that. Spread 1/3 of the sour cream all over the dough. Sprinkle on 1/3 of the fontina cheese, then scatter 1/3 of the mushroom mixture all over the pizza. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown underneath. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 70276,&quot;Hawaiian Chicken Fingers 1/3 cup Thai sweet chili sauce 2 tablespoons mayonnaise Juice of 1/2 lime For the chicken fingers: 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1 1/4 cups panko breadcrumbs 1 teaspoon paprika 3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted 2 large eggs Kosher salt Cooking spray 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, each cut into 8 strips Instructions: Make the dipping sauce: Whisk the sweet chili sauce, mayonnaise and lime juice in a bowl. Make the chicken fingers: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a shallow dish and let cool, then stir in the panko, paprika and coconut oil. (The mixture should resemble wet sand.) Whisk the eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a separate shallow dish. Set a rack on a baking sheet; coat the rack with cooking spray. Dip the chicken in the egg mixture, shaking off any excess; coat with the coconut mixture, pressing firmly to adhere. Place the chicken on the prepared rack; coat generously with cooking spray. Bake until cooked through and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Ros]&quot; 70277,&quot;Strawberry Jam 1 lemon, sliced 1 packet dry pectin 1000 g. (about 7 cups) washed, hulled and cubed strawberries 1000 g. (about 5 cups) granulated white sugar 1 Tbsp butter (optional, to reduce foaming) Instructions: Prepare the jars and lids: Wash all jars and lids thoroughly with soap and water and rinse well. Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1\\ and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil. Prepare the jam: Reserve 1/4 cup of sugar in a small bowl; add the pectin and whisk to combine. Set aside. Combine the strawberries and remaining sugar in a large, nonreactive pot; enamel or stainless steel are best (do not use copper or aluminum pots with this method). Let stand for at least 20 minutes, up to two hours or even overnight, refrigerated. Cook the jam: Stir the contents of the pot well, and put over medium-high heat. Add the lemons. Stir frequently, taking care not to burn the sugar. Bring to a boil, add the pectin-sugar mixture, and maintain a rolling boil. Skim away any foam that forms; if there is too much foam, add the butter. Test for set: Once a boil has been reached, take the temperature with a quick-read thermometer. Continue boiling and stirring until the mixture consistently reads 220F on a candy thermometer for one full minute. Turn off the heat. Remove the lemon slices. Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the jam. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the jam into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2\\ headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight. Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1\\ water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for five minutes. Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately. Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70278,&quot;Green Mustard Emulsion 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/3 cup warm water 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1 cup spinach washed, chopped, blanched, shocked in ice water and squeezed Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a blender and mix at progressively higher speeds to achieve smooth green sauce.

Before preparing the vegetables, roast the garlic. Rub 1 teaspoon of the oil and a pinch of the salt and pepper onto the cut side of the garlic. Wrap in foil and place on the grill. Roast until soft and starting to caramelize, turning occasionally, about 25 minutes. Remove from the grill and let sit until cool enough to handle. Squeeze the pulp from the garlic skins and set aside. Rub 2 teaspoons of the oil and pinch of the salt and pinch of the pepper on the tomatoes. Place on the grill away from the direct heat (or on the upper rack) and grill until tender and start to char, about 6 minutes, depending upon the heat. (The longer the tomatoes stay on the grill, the smokier flavor they will obtain.) Remove from the heat and when cool, remove the skin and roughly chop. In a large bowl, combine the eggplant, zucchini, squash, onions, and bell peppers and toss with 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper. Grill, turning, until marked by the grill and tender, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove with tongs and let cool. Dice into 1/2-inch pieces. In the bottom of a large bowl, mash the roasted garlic and 1 teaspoon of olive oil to make a paste. Drizzle in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, and the vinegar and whisk to combine. Add the chopped vegetables, tomatoes, and the herbs and toss to coat. Serve at room temperature, garnished with Parmesan. (The ratatouille can be made ahead and refrigerated overnight to allow the flavors to further develop.)

Roll a walnut-sized ball of cookie dough into a thin log about 3 inches long. Place a chocolate ball on a work surface and wrap a cookie dough log around the chocolate ball and press to adhere. It should look like a cookie version of the planet Saturn. Roll the cookie in the sugar to coat. Place the cookie on a large baking sheet and continue forming the remaining cookies and rolling them in sugar. Once all the cookie balls are on the baking sheets, use the bottom of a drinking glass to flatten the cookies to about 1/4 inch thick. Bake the cookies for 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 70286,&quot;Vinters Martini - \\the California<br> 1-ounce Vya (a California Vermoth) 2-ounces Skyy Vodka Instructions: Combine all ingredients in an ice-filled mixing glass.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. and put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven. Mix the ground nuts together. Very finely chop the apples with a knife. You should have 1 3/4 cups. In a warmed electric mixer bowl, beat the eggs and egg yolk on high speed until doubled in volume. It may take 10 minutes or more. Slowly add the sugar while beating and continue beating until the volume is tripled. The eggs should be very thick and light in color. Don&#39;t be afraid of over-beating. Sift the flour over the egg mixture. Sprinkle the ground nuts over all, followed by the apples. With a large spatula, fold the mixture together rapidly but gently, being certain to bring all the elements from the bottom of the bowl up into the mixture. Divide the batter between 2 cake pans and bake in the middle of the oven for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the sides have begun to pull away. Do not push on the meringue like top, or it may cave in. Place on a rack in a draft-free place and let cool completely. Lightly toast the pecan halves while the cake are in the oven. While the pecans are hot, quickly dip them in water and then roll them in granulated sugar until they are lightly coated. Let them dry on a rack. The cakes must be perfectly cool, or the heat with melt the cream. Invert the pans to remove the cakes, discarding the paper liners, and turn the cakes back over again so that the crusty top surface is in its original position. Place each cake on a serving platter. Using an electric standing mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip the cream with some sugar until stiff and place 8 dollops of the cream evenly around each cake. Garnish each bit of cream with a sugared pecan and serve with a shot glass of bourbon neat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70288,&quot;Emeril&#39;s Favorite Cabbage 1/2 pound bacon, coarsely chopped 4 cups thinly sliced onions 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon sugar 3 bay leaves 1 head green or white cabbage (about 3 1/2 pounds), cored and thinly sliced 1 (12-ounce) bottle beer Instructions: Cook the bacon in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, until browned and slightly crispy, about 5 minutes.

If sauce is too spicy for your taste, add additional small amount of orange juice and sugar to diminish the \\heat. Add chopped cilantro after other ingredients blended so that the cilantro retains leafy appearance. Marinate chicken breast for 1 hour - do not marinate too long or the meat will get soft and start to cook because of the acid in the lime juice. Grill chicken breast until they have nice grill marks and are just done. Salt meat to taste. Cut slices on bias for presentation. Mango Chutney: Cut mango into bite size pieces, about 1/2 to 1-inch long. Reserve any mango juice for the mixture. Place all ingredients in an 8 to 10-inch frying pan and simmer on low to medium heat for 15 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid burning. Remove from heat and when cool place in covered container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Keeps for at least 4 to 5 days. Best served slightly chilled. Tortillas: Mix dry ingredients, except sesame seeds, in large bowl. Add oil to dry ingredients then slowly add warm water until a ball forms and dough does not stick to the surface. Knead briefly, cover with plastic and let rest for at least 30 minutes. Divide dough into 10 pieces.<br> Roll out dough with floured rolling pin to about 7 or 8 inches or use tortilla press. Be sure to use waxed paper or parchment paper to prevent the dough from sticking to the press. Put the sesame seeds on a plate and lay the tortilla on the seeds - you can place sesame seeds on one or both sides depending on amount of sesame taste desired. Since the seeds will be cooked directly, a lot of sesame flavor will be released.<br> Cook each tortilla on non-greased non-stick griddle until each side begins to brown, about 45 seconds to 1 minute per side. Some of the seeds will pop. These tortillas are best served immediately while warm. Keep them covered with a tea towel. If stored, wrap tightly and reheat before serving.<br> Place tortillas on a platter, add grilled, sliced chicken and top with mango chutney. Garnish with cilantro sprigs, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 70291,&quot;Whole Roasted Garlic 1 head garlic 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Grease an 8-inch square metal baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line the pan with parchment, leaving 2 inches overhanging on 2 sides. Grease the parchment with cooking spray. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter with the chocolate, whisking until smooth and fully melted. Whisk in the cocoa powder until combined. Remove from the heat and stir in the granulated and brown sugar until combined. Whisking constantly, add the eggs and mix until fully incorporated. Add the flour and whisk until completely smooth; the mixture will be very thick. Set aside. For the cheesecake layer: Beat the cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer or in the bowl of stand mixer until smooth. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla and continue to mix until fully incorporated and fluffy. Add the egg and mix until fully combined. Spoon the brownie mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking pan, using a spatula to spread it into an even layer. Carefully pour the cheesecake mixture over the brownie layer; distribute evenly and smooth. Stir the strawberry jam with a spoon to loosen it. Drop spoonfuls of the jam over the cheesecake mixture. Using a toothpick or skewer, swirl the jam into the cheesecake, being careful not to press too deep and disturb the brownie layer. Fill a separate baking dish with hot water and place on the bottom rack of the oven. This will add moisture to the oven during baking so the cheesecake layer does not crack.

Rinse the duck inside and out and pat dry. Trim any excess fat from the neck and cavity, snip off wingtips and discard. Mix 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl, and sprinkle the bird inside and out. Using a paring knife, make dozens of slits through the skin and fat (taking care not to pierce the meat) all over both sides and all parts of the bird. Put the duck breast-side up on a rack in a roasting pan and roast for 1 hour. Take the bird out of the oven, transfer to a platter and carefully drain the fat from the pan into a measuring cup (you&#39;ll end up getting 2 to 3 cups). Return the duck to the pan, prick with the knife again, turn it breast-side down and roast another hour. Repeat each hour, roasting the duck for a total of 4 1/2 hours. While the duck cooks, make the sauce: In a small saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon duck fat over medium heat and cook the shallots until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the cherries, stock, preserves, honey and rosemary, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the lemon juice, swirl in the butter and taste for salt and pepper. Set aside until the duck is finished. After 4 1/2 hours of roasting, turn the oven temperature up to 350 degrees F, prick the duck skin one last time, salt the skin again and return bird to the oven, breast-side up. Roast for 30 minutes until the skin is nicely browned. Remove from the oven, tent with foil and let rest for 20 minutes. Gently reheat the sauce over low heat. Carve the duck, put the pieces on a serving platter and serve with sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 70308,&quot;Green Salad with Toasted Pinenuts 1 head romaine 1 yellow pepper, seeded and sliced 1 head radicchio 1 small red onion, thinly sliced 2 heads endive 1/4 cup toasted Pinenuts 1 orange, sectioned and pith removed Instructions: Toss all ingredients in a bowl and serve with your favorite vinagrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70309,&quot;Italian Spice Trade Chicken 3-4 lb. whole chicken 2 qts. water 2 cups brown sugar 2 cups kosher salt 1 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil 1/4-cup fennel seed 1 Tbs. coriander seed 1 Tbs. whole peppercorns 1-1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes 1/4-cup pure California chili powder 2 Tbs. ground cinnamon 2 Tbs.

Whip the creme fraiche to medium peaks and add the egg, chives, capers, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Make the Oysters: Mix the water into the tempura flour and refrigerate. Shuck the oysters and set aside. Reserve half of the shells for presentation and scrub them clean. On a clean work surface, lay out the shredded phyllo. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium-sized pot to 350 degrees F. (To check without a thermometer, drop a small amount of the tempura batter into the oil--it should sizzle quickly rise to the surface.) Adjust the burner to keep the temperature constant. Working with 1 oyster at a time, dredge in flour, dip in the tempura mix, and then roll around in the shredded phyllo to completely cover. Fry the oysters, turning them occasionally with a fork, until lightly browned. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. On a tray large enough to accommodate all of the oysters, form a bed of rock salt, peppercorns, and seaweed. Place the cleaned shells on the tray, spoon a dollop of the remoulade into each one, and top with an oyster. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 70312,&quot;Potatoes with Coentro (Cilantro) 12-16 small Yukon Gold or Red Bliss potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place potatoes in a medium saucepan and add water to cover generously.

First you need to line a large roasting tray with the banana leaves. You do this by holding them over the hob so the whole leaf is warmed and softened (this makes it more pliable) and placing them in the tray so there is a large piece overlapping on all sides. You need to make sure there are no gaps. Sprinkle over the chili, coconut, ginger and coriander, then place the cod, skin side up, on top. Drizzle with olive oil, season with sea salt and squeeze the lime juice over the top. Place the squeezed limes in the tray. Fold the banana leaves over the fish to seal, and place something heavy and ovenproof on top to keep in place. Place in the middle of the oven and cook for about 25 minutes. When the fish is ready, remove the skin from each fillet and serve on warmed small squares of banana leaf, spooning over all the delicious juices, with a little cooked rice and a sprinkling of fresh coriander leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 70323,&quot;Herb Crusted Salmon 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh tarragon leaves 1 cup fresh bread crumbs Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh dill 3 to 4 tablespoons butter, melted, plus 1 tablespoon 4 to 6 (6-ounce) center-cut salmon fillets Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the bacon and cook, stirring frequently, until the bacon is browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper-towel lined plate or rack. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the bacon fat. Decrease the heat to medium and add the onions to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally until the onion is softened and beginning to brown around the edges, approximately 6 minutes. Add the broth, peanuts and thyme. Increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Once the mixture reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a rapid simmer. Cook until the peanuts begin to loosen from their skins and the broth is reduced by 1/4, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and puree the mixture with a hand-held stick blender until smooth. Add the milk, vinegar, salt and pepper and puree until combined. Turn the heat back to medium and cook until warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with the reserved bacon and serve immediately. Wash the peanuts in cool water until the water runs clear.

For the filling: Place 1 tablespoon vegetable oil into a 10-inch cast-iron skillet and set over high heat until it shimmers. Add the chicken, season with 1 teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is no longer pink on the outside but not dry, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside in a medium bowl. Decrease the heat to medium and heat the remaining tablespoon vegetable oil in the skillet until it shimmers. Add the onions, mushrooms, carrots, celery, garlic, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, black pepper, dried thyme, and dried tarragon, and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the butter and melt. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually stir in the chicken broth and milk. Bring to a simmer, stirring continually. Continue stirring until the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the peas, thyme, tarragon, and reserved chicken. Cover and set aside. For the crust: Combine the bread flour, whole wheat flour, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Place in the freezer for 1 hour. Place the flour mixture and butter in a mound on a clean work surface. Use a bench scraper to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture is crumbly and the butter pieces are about the size of almonds. Add the ice water, 2 tablespoons at a time, and mix into the dough, using the bench scraper, until it just barely comes together. Do not add too much water, it will come together. Shape into a rectangle and pound with a rolling pin until it is about the size of a sheet of notebook paper, approximately 8 1/2 by 11 inches. Use the bench scraper to fold the dough into thirds, like a letter. Pound with the rolling pin until the piece of dough is again the size of a sheet of notebook paper and rotate 90 degrees. Repeat the pounding, folding, and rotating 2 more times for a total of 4 turns of the dough. Pound with rolling pin and fold the shorter sides of the rectangle in towards the center, from top to bottom, and then fold in half, like a book. Wrap in parchment paper and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the egg wash: Combine the beaten egg and water in a small dish and set aside. To build the pie: Divide the warm filling into 4 (16-ounce) ramekins and place on a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Remove the puff pastry from the refrigerator. Divide in half. Return one half to the refrigerator. Sprinkle lightly with flour and roll to 1/4-inch thick and, using your ramekins as a guide, cut 2 circles that are 1/2 inch wider than the rim, using a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Refrigerate excess dough for another use. Brush each dough round with egg wash and place egg washed-side down onto the top of each filled ramekin. Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash. Bake for 15 minutes.

Cook until the other side is golden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70372,&quot;Shrimp a La Diabla (Camarones a la Diabla) 1/2 cup vegetable oil 4 cups dry Yunnan chiles 2 tablespoons granulated garlic<br> 2 tablespoons salt<br> 1 tablespoon ground black pepper<br> 4 tablespoons melted butter 2 1/2 pounds shrimp, shelled and deveined<br> Serving suggestions: rice and beans, corn or flour tortillas Instructions: Heat a large skillet over medium heat; add vegetable oil, then add the Yunnan chiles. Fry until the chiles are a dark red color, about 5 minutes. Add chiles to a 64-ounce blender along with the garlic, salt, pepper, 2 tablespoons melted butter and 2 cups water. Blend together until you have a thick, smooth consistency, about 3 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, then add blended diabla sauce and bring to a boil (see Cook&#39;s Note). Heat a separate skillet over medium heat and add remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter. Saute shrimp until they are half cooked, about 3 minutes, then add the diabla sauce. Keep over medium heat until shrimp are fully cooked, another 3 minutes. Serve shrimp with a side of rice and beans and enjoy with corn or flour tortillas. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Vermentino]&quot; 70373,&quot;Sheet Pan Sausage and Mushroom Pizza 4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 100 degrees F) 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes 2 garlic cloves, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 12 ounces hot Italian sausage, casings removed (about 4 links) 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and thinly sliced 6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 1 pound part-skim mozzarella, thinly sliced Torn fresh basil leaves, for serving Instructions: For the dough: combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Combine the warm water and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a liquid measuring cup. Turn the mixer to low and add the water mixture, mixing until a loose ball forms. (You can also do this by hand: Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, then add the water and oil and stir with a wooden spoon.) Increase the speed to medium-high and knead the dough until smooth and slightly tacky, about 7 minutes. (If using your hands, gather the dough into a ball, turn it out onto a floured surface and knead, dusting your hands and the surface as needed with flour, until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky, about 5 minutes.) Pour the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil into an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet or rectangular black steel pan. Transfer the ball of dough to the pan, turning to coat it with oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until the dough fills about two-thirds of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Slide your hands under the dough and lift, gently stretching it to fit the pan. (It&#39;s OK if it doesn&#39;t stretch to the corners.) For the final rise, loosely cover with plastic wrap and set aside until slightly puffy, 30 to 45 minutes. While the dough rises, position the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. If you have a pizza stone, put it on the lower rack. Preheat the oven to its highest bake setting, 500 to 525 degrees F. Once the oven comes to temperature, heat for at least 1 hour before baking your pizza. For the pizza: stir the crushed tomatoes, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper together in a medium bowl or 2-cup liquid measuring cup until combined. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until it is browned at the edges and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving the rendered fat in the pan. Add the mushrooms to the hot pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are tender, about 4 minutes. Remove to a separate bowl to cool. When the dough has risen and is ready for topping, sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan evenly over it all the way to the edges. Arrange the mozzarella over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border. Spoon the tomato sauce over the cheese leaving some of the cheese exposed. Sprinkle the cooled sausage and mushrooms over the sauce, then sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons Parmesan. Put the pizza pan directly on the pizza stone if using, and bake until the crust is browned at the edges and the cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly before removing the pizza from the pan, about 10 minutes. Top with torn basil, cut into squares and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 70374,&quot;Seared Petite Lamb Chops with Rosemary Balsamic Reduction 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt 6 (4-ounce) double lamb rib chops (2 ribs) with bones attached, ribs frenched 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 cup balsamic vinegar 1 large or 2 small rosemary sprigs 2 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine olive oil, parsley, rosemary, and garlic. Season with salt, to taste. Set aside. Set a 12-inch oven-safe saute pan over medium-high heat. Season the lamb with 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the black pepper. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil to the saute pan and place the lamb, fat side down, in the pan. Sear the lamb until the fat has rendered and the skin is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook the lamb, turning to cook evenly on each side, about 2 minutes each side. Baste them with the herb and oil mixture. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the lamb is rare, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can grill the lamb chops. Make the balsamic drizzle while the lamb is cooking: Set a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat and add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the shallots to the pan and sweat until translucent, about 1 minute. Add the garlic to the pan and sweat for 30 seconds. Pour the balsamic vinegar into the pan and bring to a boil. Add the rosemary and allow the balsamic to gently boil and reduce until only about 1/4 cup of balsamic remains, about 10 minutes. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Remove from the heat and swirl the butter into the pan. Remove the rosemary sprigs before using. When the lamb is rare, remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. To serve, slice each double chop in half, and drizzle with the balsamic reduction. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 70375,&quot;Southern-Style Sushi 1 1/4 cups cooked long-grain rice, at room temperature 1/4 cup leftover gorgonzola cream sauce, plus more for dipping 2 tablespoons crumbled gorgonzola 2 tablespoons leftover barbecue butter, softened 4 leftover stalks grilled asparagus from Grilled Flank Steak with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce and Asparagus, cut into thirds, recipe follows 6 ounces leftover grilled flank steak, from Grilled Flank Steak with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce and Asparagus, cut into 12 1/2-inch-wide slices, recipe follows Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon salted butter, plus 1 stick slightly softened 1 shallot, minced 1 cup heavy cream 1/4 pound gorgonzola cheese,crumbled Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 pounds flank steak 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon sugar 1/4 cup paprika 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 2 pounds large asparagus, trimmed Instructions: Combine the rice, cream sauce and gorgonzola in a large bowl until the rice is coated and creamy.

Roll each half into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. Press the dough into 2 greased 12-inch deep-dish pizza pans. Cover with a clean dish towel and let rise 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions. Season with salt and pepper and saute for 2 minutes. Add the peppers, season with salt and pepper, and continue to saute for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. In the same pan, over medium heat, add the sausage and render for 4 to 6 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Lay 1/4-pound of the sliced provolone on the bottom of each pizza. Spoon 1/2 the onion and pepper mixture over each pizza. Sprinkle 1/2 of the sausage over the onion mixture on each pizza. Scatter 1 cup sliced mushrooms over sausage. Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce over the top of each pizza. Layer 1/4-pound mozzarella slices over top of each pizza. Drizzle with remaining olive oil. Bake the pizzas for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and cut into individual servings. In an electric mixing bowl, whisk the yeast, sugar, water and lard together to make a paste. Add the flour and salt and mix, using a dough hook, until the dough comes away from the sides and crawls up the dough hook. Remove the dough from the bowl. Grease the bowl with olive oil and place the dough back in the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide dough in half. Roll the dough into balls, cover, and let the dough rest for 15 to 20 minutes.

Season the shrimp with salt and pepper to taste and saute for 1-2 minutes on each side until almost cooked through. Heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots, apples and curry and cook until soft. Raise the heat to high, add the wine and cook until reduced. Add the stock and cook until reduced by half. Reduce heat to medium, whisk in the cream, coconut milk and brown sugar and cook until slightly thickened. Add the shrimp and the clams and cook until the clams open. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Preheat your Belgian waffle iron. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the wild rice and stir just until the mixture is well combined, season well with salt and pepper to taste. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and baking soda. In another bowl, beat together the milk, buttermilk and eggs. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir together with the whisk until just combined. Stir in the wild rice mixture. Lightly butter the grids of the waffle iron, if needed. Spoon out 1 cup of batter onto the hot iron. The batter will be thick so spread with a metal spatula. Close the lid and bake until the waffle is golden and crisp. Remove from the iron and cut into quarters. Heat the brown sugar and honey in small saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar has melted and is bubbling. Add the mango and cook over medium-low heat until the mango is soft and caramelized.

Add the flour slowly, making a stiff dough that is silky smooth. Turn dough out into a large oiled bowl, cover with a cloth. Place dough in a warm place, and allow to double in bulk. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Pound and knead the dough, until it is silky smooth. Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and let rise again, until doubled in bulk. Meanwhile, sterilize the palmetto leaves or shoe strings by soaking them in boiling water. Portion dough into 10-ounce loaves. As a loaf is formed, immediately place a palmetto leaf or shoestring down the length of the loaf, and turn the loaf over onto a baking sheet, leaf/string side down. Repeat with the remaining loaves. Let the dough rise, leaf side down, for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake loaves until they are golden brown, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 70380,&quot;Potato Rolls 1 medium baking potato (about 6 ounces) 1/2 cup hot water (115 degrees F) 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar (4 1/4 ounces) 2 1/4 teaspoons rapid rise yeast (1/4 ounce package) 1 teaspoon fine salt 4 1/4 to 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (13 1/8 ounces) 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature, plus more for brushing Instructions: Cook the potato in a microwave on HIGH until soft and it squeezes easily, using the designated baked potato setting, or up to 15 minutes. Peel and pass the warm potato through a potato ricer or food mill into a large bowl. (You should have 1 cup pureed potato.) Stir the hot water, eggs, half the sugar and yeast into the potato. Add 2 cups of the flour and the salt and mix with a wooden spoon to make a sticky, shaggy dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Beat the butter with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar in a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy. Switch to the dough hook and add the risen dough to the creamed butter. Continue to mix on low until the butter and dough come together, about 1 minute. (Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl if needed; the dough will be very sticky.) Gradually add the remaining 2 1/4 cups of flour, about 1/4 cup at a time, to make a shaggy dough that pulls away from the side of the bowl. Continue kneading on medium speed until dough is smooth but still tacky, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand until dough is smooth and no longer tacky, 1 to 2 minutes more. (If the dough is still sticky, gradually add 1/4 cup flour.) Shape dough into a ball. Brush a large bowl with butter and turn dough around in bowl to coat lightly. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic, and note the time. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Generously butter two 9-inch round or square cake pans. Turn the dough out of the bowl and pat into a rectangle about 16- by 8-inches, gently pressing out excess air. Divide the dough into 32 equal portions, about an ounce each, with a pizza wheel or bench scraper. (If you don&#39;t have a scale, divide the dough in half lengthwise, then in half crosswise. Cut each of those four sections into 8 equal-sized rolls.) Tuck the edges of the dough under to make round rolls and place them seam-side down in the prepared pan, leaving a little space in between each roll. (See Cook&#39;s Note) Cover the pan with buttered plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the rolls rise almost to the rim of the pan and have more than doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Bake rolls until golden brown and puffy, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the rolls registers 190 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Remove rolls from the oven and quickly brush the tops with soft butter. Cook the rolls in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning them out onto a rack in one piece. Cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature in one piece or pulled apart as individual rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70381,&quot;Lemon Cream Meringue Pie Flaky Pie Dough for a one-crust pie, about 10 ounces, recipe follows 2 cups milk 2/3 cup sugar 3 to 4 medium lemons 1/4 cup cornstarch 4 egg yolks 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 4 egg whites 2/3 cup sugar Pinch salt 1 1/4 cups all-purpose bleached flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter 2 to 3 tablespoons cold water 2 1/2 cups (about 11 ounces) all-purpose bleached flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water Instructions: To make the filling, combine milk and sugar in a nonreactive saucepan, preferably enameled iron. Strip the zest from the lemons with a sharp vegetable peeler, making sure you remove the yellow zest but none of the white pith beneath. If you do remove some of the white pith, scrape it off the strips of zest with the point of a paring knife and discard it. Add the zest to the milk and sugar and bring to a simmer over low heat. Remove from heat and allow to steep for 5 minutes; remove the strips of zest with a slotted spoon or skimmer and discard them.<br> Squeeze lemons to make 1/2 cup strained juice. Place juice in a mixing bowl and whisk in cornstarch, then yolks. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil over low heat and whisk about a third of the boiling milk into the lemon juice mixture.<br> Return remaining milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk the lemon juice and yolk mixture back into it, whisking constantly until the filling comes to a boil and thickens. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, whisk in butter and pour into a nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of the filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees. (If you prepare the filling in advance, let it come to room temperature before proceeding.)<br> Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Roll out the dough to make bottom crust and arrange in pan. Chill crust until firm.<br> To bake the crust, pierce it all over with the tines of a fork at 1/2-inch intervals. Line it with a disk of parchment or waxed paper and fill with cherry stones or dried beans. Bake about 20 minutes, until lightly colored. Remove paper and beans and continue baking until the crust is a deep golden brown. Cool crust on a rack.<br> Spread the cooled filling evenly in the cooled crust.<br> Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.<br> To make the meringue bring a small pan of water to a boil. Lower heat so that water simmers. Combine egg whites, sugar and salt in the bowl of the mixer or if you are using a hand whisk another heatproof bowl. Place bowl over pan of simmering water and whisk gently for about 2 minutes, until egg whites are hot (about 140 degrees) and sugar has dis solved. Whip meringue on medium speed until it has cooled and is able to hold a shape, but it should not be dry. Distribute spoonfuls of the meringue all over the top of the pie, then use the back of a spoon or a small offset metal spatula to spread the meringue evenly. It should cover the top of the pie and touch the edges of the crust all around. Here and there, bring up the surface of the meringue so that it is swirled. Place the pie on a cookie sheet and bake for about 5 to 10 minutes, until the meringue is colored evenly. Cool on a rack. To mix the dough by hand, combine flour, salt and baking powder in a medium-sized mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Cut butter into 1tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible.<br> Sprinkle the minimum amount of water over the butter and flour mixture and stir gently with a fork the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough, a tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily.<br> To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible about 15 pulses in all.<br> Scatter the minimum amount of water on the butter and flour mixture and pulse 5 or 6 times the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough,one tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough). Sandwich the disk(s) of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press it into a 6inch circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70382,&quot;Sauteed Flank Steak 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup dark balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground pepper 16- to 24-ounce flank steak 2 cups julienned zucchini 4 portions mashed potatoes 1/2 cup prepared veal stock, warmed Instructions: In a mixing bowl, blend the oil, balsamic, salt and pepper. Then pour the marinade over the flank steak in a pan.

Trim the cauliflower: Cut the stem flush with the bottom. Cut a few slits into the core extending into the thick branches of the cauliflower (keep the florets intact). Put 3 thyme sprigs, the smashed garlic, bay leaves, coriander seeds and peppercorns on a square of cheesecloth and tie into a bundle. Combine 12 cups water, the celery, shallot, lemon zest, wine, sugar, 1/3 cup salt and the cheesecloth bundle in a pot large enough to submerge the cauliflower. Bring to a boil, whisking to dissolve the salt and sugar. Carefully add the cauliflower core-side down and cook until there is a slight resistance when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes. (It&#39;s OK if the top of the cauliflower pops up during cooking.) Remove the cauliflower to a baking sheet. Meanwhile, make the garlic oil: Combine the remaining 3 thyme sprigs, the sliced garlic, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the garlic starts browning, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard the thyme. Brush the cauliflower with half of the oil, leaving the sliced garlic behind. Roast the cauliflower until browned and tender, 30 to 40 minutes, brushing halfway through with the remaining garlic oil; reserve 1 teaspoon garlic oil and the sliced garlic. Transfer the cauliflower to a cutting board or platter using a spatula. Add the parsley to the reserved garlic oil and spoon over the cauliflower.

Using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut in the cold butter until pea-size. In a separate bowl, beat 4 of the eggs with a fork until fluffy and pale yellow. Using a fork, mix the eggs into the flour mixture until the dough just comes together. Finish combining the dough with your hands to form a ball, being careful to avoid over-working the dough. Cut the ball in half, forming two smaller balls of dough. Gently press down on each to form two equal disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. For the filling: In a bowl, coat the apple slices with the lemon juice. Add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg, and toss to evenly coat. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Dust a clean surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough, one disk at a time, to 1/4-inch-thick, about 12 inches in diameter. Spray the pie pan with nonstick cooking spray. Roll one portion of the dough onto the rolling pin and carefully lift into the pan, leaving the excess dough hanging over the edge. Spoon the fruit filling into the pan, creating a mountain of fruit. Then push down the center of the filling pile to even it out, and trim the crust. Roll the second portion of the dough onto the rolling pin and place over the filling, with the excess dough hanging around the edges of the pan. Flute the edges of the crust by pinching dough between your thumb and forefinger all the way around the edge. Cut holes in the top crust with a paring knife or poke holes with a fork to allow steam to escape. Beat the remaining egg, and brush the piecrust with the egg wash using a pastry brush or your fingers. Sprinkle the crust with the turbinado sugar. Bake until golden brown and the juices begin to bubble, about 1 hour. Cool the pie for several hours before cutting and serving (if you can wait that long!). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 70411,&quot;Puff Pastry Snowflakes 6 tablespoons vanilla sugar 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed (half of a 17-ounce package) 1 large egg 1 tablespoon water Instructions: Put a large piece of parchment paper on a work surface and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the vanilla sugar. Lay the puff pastry on top, sprinkle with 2 more tablespoons vanilla sugar and roll out into a 12-inch square. Trim the edges to make an even square, then cut the pastry into four 3-inch-wide strips. Lightly beat the egg and water in a small bowl. Brush the egg wash lengthwise down the center of 3 of the pastry strips. Stack the 3 strips neatly on top of each other; top with the remaining pastry strip. Place the rolling pin lengthwise down the center of the pastry stack and press gently to adhere the layers in the center; the edges should remain separated. Cut the stack crosswise into 1/2-by-3-inch strips. (If the pastry is too soft to cut, transfer to a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Pinch the center of each strip, then twist the pastry twice at the pinch point. Arrange 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Fan out the edges of the pastry. Lightly brush with the egg wash, then sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons vanilla sugar. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes. Position racks in the middle and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Immediately transfer the cookies to racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 70412,&quot;Barbeque Spiced Grilled T-Bone Steak Four 14- to 16-ounce T-Bone steaks 2 ounces chili oil 6 ounces BBQ Spice, recipe follows 1 pound Garlic Fried Yukon Gold Potatoes, recipe follows 16 ounces Arugula Chanterelle Succotash, recipe follows 6 ounces BBQ Zinfandel Reduction, recipe follows 1-ounce dry mustard 1-ounce chili powder 1/2 ounce cayenne 2 ounces brown sugar 1-ounce orange zest 1-ounce paprika 1-ounce garlic powder 1-ounce onion powder 1/2 ounce salt 1/2 ounce black pepper 1 clove garlic, minced 6 ounces butter 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, diced 1/2-inch thick Salt and pepper to taste Canola oil for frying 3 tablespoons grape seed oil 3 ounces chanterelle mushrooms<br> 1-ounce garlic, minced<br> 1-ounce shallots, minced 4 ounces sweet peas, blanched<br> 4 ounces sweet corn, cut off cob<br> 4 ounces baby lima beans, blanched<br> 1-ounce red bell pepper, diced<br> 1-ounce yellow bell pepper, diced<br> 1-ounce chives, minced<br> Salt and pepper to taste 1/2 ounce grapeseed oil 1 shallot, minced<br> 1 green apple, chopped<br> 2 stalks celery, chopped<br> 1 carrot, chopped<br> 4 bay leaves<br> 1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns<br> 2 bottles zinfandel wine<br> 1-quart veal stock<br> 3 ounces barbeque sauce 1-ounce butter<br> Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Preheat Grill: Rub steak with cl oil and BBQ Spice on both sides.

To prepare the patties, sprinkle the ground beef with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon pepper. Mix well. Divide the beef into 4 burgers to create 5-inch-wide, even burgers. Do not over mix or squish, because this will cause the burgers to be tough. To cook the burgers, ladle the bacon fat on a hot flat top grill or in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Once the bacon fat is hot, add the burgers and cook for 4 minutes on the first side, and then flip and repeat the cooking. This should yield a medium burger. For higher cook temperature, finish in a 400 degree F oven to desired temperature. Once cooked to desired temperature, top with the BBQ pork and a slice of cheese. Allow to melt for 1 minute. During this time, spread the butter on the buns. Then place the buttered side on the flat top or in the pan to brown the butter; this will create \\sealed\\ bread to build the burger on. Begin assembling the burger. Take the buns off the grill and place 1/4 cup slaw on each cooked bottom bun, then a tomato slice, 2 red onions and the burger patty. Finish with the top bun. A skewer can be placed to hold the burger together. To prepare the pork, preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Then sprinkle the pork with the Cajun spice and place in a 6-inch-deep casserole or roasting dish. Next, add the stock, vinegar and vegetables. Cover with foil and place in the oven for 3 hours. Once cooked, remove the pork and allow to cool. Then pick or shred the meat. In a bowl, whisk together the ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, vinegar and spice. Then, in a small saucepan over low heat, cook for 10 to 12 minutes to blend the flavors, stirring throughout. Once cooked, remove from the heat and hold. The BBQ sauce yields 2 cups. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 70424,&quot;Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes with Brown Butter Buttercream 2 cups all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice 3 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 cups granulated sugar 3/4 cup canola oil 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups canned pumpkin 4 large eggs Brown Butter Buttercream, recipe follows 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, divided 4 cups powdered sugar (about 2 pounds) 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 to 6 tablespoons buttermilk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Lightly spray a large, oven-safe platter and oven-safe bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Mix the flour, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, cloves and salt in a medium bowl. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar. Mix in the molasses and egg, and then stir in the flour mixture. Wrap in plastic wrap and let chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Carefully cover the platter and bowl with the dough, trimming the excess. Chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. Place the platter and bowl on a sheet tray and bake until just golden at the edges, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely. For the candied walnut maple mousse: Lower the oven to 325 degrees F. Toss the walnuts, egg whites, confectioners&#39; sugar, cayenne, salt and 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder in a bowl until evenly coated. Spread on a parchment-lined sheet tray and bake until crispy and brown, about 20 minutes. Place in a food processor and process until finely ground. Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat the maple syrup in a small saucepan with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder. Add the gelatin and whisk until dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the cream on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Slowly fold in the maple syrup mixture and ground walnuts, being careful not to deflate the whipped cream. Chill in the fridge until ready to serve. For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Mix slowly until stiff enough to form peaks; keep beating until the icing is pure white, fluffy and shiny. Use a silicone spatula to transfer the icing to a pastry piping bag and hold it at room temperature until ready to decorate the gingerbread. For the cinnamon sugar tortilla chips: Preheat the oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F. Alternatively, heat 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees F in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stockpot. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Cut the tortillas lengthwise and then widthwise, creating small chips. Carefully lower the tortillas into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Depending on the size of your fryer or pot, you maybe have to make 2 batches. Remove to a paper towel-lined sheet tray and then toss in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until coated. To assemble: Using a knife or small offset spatula, remove the gingerbread from the platter and bowl. Fill the bowl with the chilled candied walnut maple mousse and arrange the cinnamon sugar tortilla chips around the bowl. Cut the tip off the pastry piping bag of royal icing and pipe festive designs around the outside of the bowl and platter, adding candies as desired.

Zest and juice 10 of the lemons and reserve for the citrus shallot dressing. Juice the remaining 2 lemons and reserve 1/2 cup juice for the hummus. Slice the lemon rinds and add them to the bottle. Add the olive oil until the bottle is full. Turn the bottle upside down so the hops and rinds float upwards, infusing the oil. The longer the oil sits, the stronger the flavor. Infuse for a minimum of 48 hours, turning the bottle several times a day. For the hummus: Pour the beans into a large stockpot. Cover with cold water until the water line is about 3 inches above the beans. Partially cover the stockpot with a lid and bring the water to a boil over medium-low heat. Simmer the beans slowly so they don&#39;t crack and break, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. If the water has been completely absorbed but the beans don&#39;t seem tender, add a bit of warm water and continue cooking to the desired texture. Drain any excess water and pour the beans onto a cookie sheet in an even layer to cool. For the citrus shallot dressing: Add the orange zest and juice to a mixing bowl with the reserved zest and juice of 10 lemons. Add the olive oil and shallots and use a whisk or blender to mix together. Refrigerate until using. To finish the hummus, puree the basil and garlic in a blender or food processor. Add the cooled beans and process. While the blender is running, gradually add the reserved 1/2 cup lemon juice and the olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until using. For the roasted red bell peppers: Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs, until all sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Peel the peppers, removing the skins, seeds and stems. Dice the peppers, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt. Set aside. For the sandwiches: Prepare a grill to medium-high heat. Drizzle olive oil over the asparagus spears and red onion slices. Season with salt and pepper. Grill the vegetables about 1 minute per side. Grill each side of the ciabatta halves until lightly browned. To assemble: Spread a small amount of hummus in the middle of each plate to keep the sandwich from sliding around when fully assembled. Place a grilled ciabatta half on top of the hummus and spread a generous amount of hummus on top of each ciabatta half, about 1/4 cup. Add some roasted red bell peppers and grilled red onions. In a small bowl, toss the arugula in the citrus shallot dressing. Pile up some arugula on top of each bread piece, followed by 4 spears of grilled asparagus.

Place all the remaining meatball ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir well to combine. Using your hands, divide the meatball mixture into 12 even portions and roll into smooth meatballs. Place meatballs on a plate as they are formed. When all the meatballs are shaped, gently place the balls into the simmering sauce 1 at a time. Simmer the sauce, uncovered, for at least 10 minutes before stirring. The meatballs should begin to float to the top when they are able to be stirred. Stir gently and continue to simmer for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Using oven mitts or pot holders, remove the sauce from the heat and cover to keep warm. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Using a sharp knife, slice a thin layer off the top of each hoagie bun and, using your hands, remove some of the bready interior to form a hollowed-out submarine shape. Brush the inside of the hollowed out buns with the olive oil. Divide half of the grated mozzarella evenly between the hoagie buns and bake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted and buns are lightly golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oven and ladle some of the hot tomato sauce into the buns. Place 2 or 3 meatballs inside each bun and top with more sauce. Divide the remaining mozzarella cheese among the tops of the buns and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Return to the oven and bake until bubbly and hot throughout and the cheeses are golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch Published by William Morrow, 1993. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, salt, basil, oregano, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, and sugar to the pot with the onion and stir well. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally with a long-handled wooden spoon. Using oven mitts or pot holders, remove the pot from the heat and use the sauce as needed. You can store this sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or freeze it for up to 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 70456,&quot;Deviled Chicken Francese 4 pieces boneless, skinless chicken breast (no tenders) Salt and pepper<br> AP flour, about 1 cup<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1 scant tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 3 tablespoons milk<br> 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese<br> 1/4 to 1/3 cup olive oil or vegetable oil (light in color olive oil or safflower oil) 2 lemons<br> 3 tablespoons butter<br> 2 large cloves garlic, 1 crushed or chopped, 1 halved<br> About 3/4 cup white wine<br> 1 tablespoon Calabrian chili paste, harissa or sriracha<br> About 1 1/2 cups chicken stock<br> A handful flat-leaf parsley, for serving<br> 1 loaf ciabatta bread, 12 to 14 inches long, halved<br> EVOO, for drizzling<br> Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling 1 large bundle arugula, cleaned, or boxed leaves<br> Instructions: Gather your ingredients and a gel board to prepare chicken. Halve the chicken breasts horizontally and butterfly them. Use a mallet to thin meat or even it out if needed -- it depends on the size of the chicken breasts. Season meat with salt and pepper. Set a station up: Flour in shallow dish; eggs beaten with mustard, milk, salt, pepper and cheese; large frying pan with oil (4 to 5 turns of the pan); a baking sheet with wire rack inserted and lined with parchment paper to remove the chicken to. Preheat the oil in skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Coat chicken 2 at a time in flour, shake of excess, then in egg and allow excess to drip off. Cook chicken 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Repeat, removing cooked chicken to wire rack. Once chicken is cooked, slice and lightly brown 1 lemon; add to pan with chicken. Wipe excess oil from pan, return to heat and add butter. When it foams add 1 clove crushed garlic, juice of 1 lemon, wine and chili paste and reduce about 3 minutes. Add stock and reduce 5 minutes more. Pick and chop the parsley. Char the bread over gas burner or under broiler. Rub charred bread with halved garlic, drizzle with EVOO, sprinkle with flaky sea salt and cut bread into chunks. Add the chicken back to sauce and heat the meat through, 3 to 4 minutes, turning occasionally. Add the sliced lemons and coat with sauce. Add parsley and transfer to plates. Serve cutlets with a small handful of arugula leaves alongside and some charred bread for mopping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 70457,&quot;Southern Fried Chicken 2 cups buttermilk, preferably salt free 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne) 10 pieces chicken (2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 legs, 4 breast pieces), each breast half cut in half or substitute 2 pounds boneless chicken breasts, skin intact 1 1/4 cups mixed whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3/4 to 1 1/4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 3/4 to 1 1/4 teaspoons ground red pepper (cayenne) Crisco for frying Instructions: In a shallow, non-aluminum dish, combine first 5 ingredients. Add chicken and toss once to coat. Cover and chill 8 hours or overnight, turning once or twice. Place pieces on rack to drain slightly but do not pat dry. In a paper bag, combine flour, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. Toss chicken in flour mixture and place on a clean rack or a baking sheet. Toss each piece again, shake off excess flour and set aside at cool room temperature for 2 hours. In 2 large, heavy skillets, or 1 electric skillet, heat enough oil to reach a depth of 1/2-inch to 350 to 360 degrees. Add chicken pieces to the hot oil one by one. (Note: Adding too many pieces at once lowers the temperature of the oil and the chicken will not brown properly.) Adjust temperature so oil remains between 300 and 320 degrees. Cook, turning once with tongs, 10 to 12 minutes per side (4 to 5 minutes for boneless breasts) or until juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part. (Thicker pieces may require more cooking time.) Transfer pieces as they are done to paper towels to drain. Serve hot or warm. Gravy for Fried Chicken Drain all the oil from the cooking skillet through a sieve and into a bowl. Return the skillet to medium heat. Add two tablespoons of the chicken-frying fat to the skillet, along with any browned bits caught by the strainer. Add two tablespoons of flour, blend well, and cook for two minutes, stirring. Off heat, add a scant two cups boiling chicken stock. Simmer for 2 minutes, season (using freshly grated nutmeg, if desired) and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 70458,&quot;Coconut Natural Daiquiri 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup coconut water, preferably fresh 12 ounces white rum 6 ounces coconut rum liqueur 3 ounces freshly squeezed lime juice plus 6 lime wedges 2 cups shaved or crushed ice Instructions: Bring the sugar and coconut water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the coconut simple syrup cool completely. (This recipe makes approximately 3/4 cup coconut simple syrup, which can be used to sweeten other things if not used for making daiquiris.)

Process the flour, butter, granulated and confectioners&#39; sugars and salt in a food processor until the mixture resembles wet crumbs and holds together when squeezed in your palm, about 2 minutes (this takes longer than seems necessary, but be patient). Divide the mixture evenly between 2 disposable 5-inch pie tins, and press the dough very firmly into the bottoms and up the sides, making sure to press it into the corners very well. Smooth and flatten the tops with your fingers or the back of a small spoon. Bake the crusts on the hot baking sheet until the bottom and sides are golden brown (probably more in some spots than in others), about 12 minutes. Let cool completely on a cooling rack. For the filling: Whisk together the eggs, cream, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and allspice in a medium bowl. Whisk in the sweet potato and then the melted butter. Mound the filling in the pie shells, and bake until puffed and the centers still look slightly wet but not loose, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before serving. If using marshmallows: Right before serving, preheat the broiler. Pile 1/4 cup mini marshmallows in the center of each pie, and broil until the marshmallows are bubbling and well browned, 30 to 40 seconds. Serve immediately.

Remove the chicken to a medium bowl and add enough cornstarch to coat the chicken; it should form a sticky-like paste around the chicken. Cover the bowl and let rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Combine all the sauce ingredients, except the cornstarch slurry, in a large saucepan over medium heat and simmer until the sugar dissolves. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pan to 350 to 360 degrees F. Carefully test the oil by dropping a single piece of chicken into it and cook for around 4 minutes. When the oil is hot enough, slowly add a few pieces of chicken at a time, until all the chicken is cooked. Remove the chicken from the oil to paper towels to drain. Add a little more oil to a clean wok or skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot add the chiles and green onions to saute for around 1 minute. Add the already cooked chicken to the wok and toss around with the chiles so that all the chicken gets great flavor. At this point add the warmed sauce mixture, a few spoonfuls at a time, until all the chicken is coated but not soaking wet. If the sauce is a little runny add the cornstarch slurry, a little at a time, to thicken the sauce. Remember you have to cook the sauce until bubbling after you have added the cornstarch. This normally takes a couple of minutes over low heat. Remove the chicken mixture from the wok to a serving bowl and serve immediately on fried or steamed rice. Garnish with whole cilantro leaves before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70469,&quot;Saffron Lobster Salad on Grilled Fingerlings 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1 large pinch saffron threads 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup best-quality mayonnaise 2 cloves finely chopped garlic Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 cups diced cooked lobster meat (see Cook&#39;s Note below) 1 large stalk celery, finely diced 1/2 small red onion, finely diced 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives 12 fingerling potatoes, par-boiled and sliced in half lengthwise 3 tablespoons canola oil Instructions: Cook&#39;s Note: Use the leftover lobster meat from the whole lobsters that were cooked in the Grilled Lobster Tails with Green Curry-Mango Dipping Sauce recipe.

Let rest 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70492,&quot;Chocolate Cookie Jars 5 pounds white chocolate, tempered Cocoa butter Powdered food coloring, as desired Instructions: To make the round cookie jar: I used a tall round container that was about 7 inches in diameter as a guide for this shape. Cover the container with parchment paper and tape it closed but do not tape the parchment to the container. Cut a transfer sheet that is 9 1/2 inches wide and 21 inches long. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of white chocolate onto the transfer sheet. Let the chocolate set until firm yet pliable but not hard. Turn the acetate so the long side is facing you. Lay the container vertically on top of the chocolate and roll the transfer sheet around the container until the ends meet. Use tape to keep it closed. Place it in the refrigerator and allow the chocolate to set completely. When set, remove from the refrigerator. Lift the container from the center of the cookie jar. Remove the parchment paper and the transfer sheet. Rewrap the container in parchment for the next step. Make the lid: Use an offset spatula to spread 1/8-inch thick layer of white chocolate onto the transfer sheet. Use a sharp paring knife to trace around a cardboard cake round to make a 7-inch diameter circle. Let the chocolate set until firm. When the chocolate has set, peel off the transfer sheet. Use a hot knife to trim the top inch off the top of the cookie jar. Use a hot serrated chef&#39;s knife to cut through the chocolate. Heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \\cut\\ through the chocolate by melting it. Use a gentle sawing motion to encourage the knife through the chocolate. Invert the lid so the pattern side is down. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the trim to the circle by resting the trim on top of the circle. Let the chocolate set. Make the base and the handle: Use an offset spatula to spread 1/8-inch thick layer of white chocolate onto a piece of acetate. Rest the cookie jar on top of the wet chocolate. Use a sharp paring knife to trace around the cookie jar. Use a 1-inch round cutter to cut a round handle in the chocolate. When the chocolate is set, remove the excess chocolate. Set the handle aside. Use the knife to trim around the base of the cookie jar, if necessary. Let the chocolate set completely and the base will be automatically secured to the bottom of the jar. Paint the handle and adhere it to the jar: If you want to paint the handle, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Place the paint in the airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and paint the handle, as you are inspired. If you do not have an airbrush, you can use a paintbrush to paint the decorations, applying color where you are inspired to do so. Use a hot knife to cut the bottom third of the circle to create a straight edge. Dip this edge in tempered chocolate and adhere to the cookie jar lid. Allow the chocolate to set. Make the reinforcement for the top of the jar: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate over a sheet of acetate (this does not have to be a transfer sheet). Use a sharp paring knife to cut a piece that is 3 inches wide and 20 inches long. Position this piece with the wet chocolate side touching the inside of the cookie jar so it is just inside and protruding about 1/4-inch above the rim of the jar. The finished lid will rest around the piece. When the chocolate has set, peel off the acetate sheet. Fill the cookie jar with cookies. Place the lid on top. Voila! Make the Clown Hat cookie jar: Make a cone out of a sheet of acetate securing it closed with tape. Use a scissor to trim the edge of the cone so the end is straight. The cone I made was about 15-inches tall with an opening diameter of 7 1/2 inches. Use a ladle to fill the cone with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the cone should be evenly coated with chocolate. You may need to repeat this step 1 more time so the cone is a good 1/4-inch thick. Wipe the bottom of the cone on the edge of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge of the cone clean with a paring knife. You can place the cone in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Set the cones aside.<br> Cut the cookie jar: Tip: Choose a support like a tin can that is the height of the cut you want to make. Use the support as a guide to help you make a straight cut. Use a hot serrated chef&#39;s knife to cut through the top third of the cone. Tip: Make sure you cut far enough into the cone to create an opening large enough to accommodate your hand! To make the cut, heat a serrated knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \\cut\\ through the chocolate by melting it. Use a gentle sawing motion to encourage the knife through the chocolate. Make the base: Use an offset spatula to spread 1/8-inch thick layer of white chocolate onto a piece of acetate. Rest the cookie jar on top of the wet chocolate. Use a sharp paring knife to trace around the cookie jar. When the chocolate is set, remove the excess chocolate and use the knife to trim, if necessary. Let the chocolate set completely and the base will be automatically secured to the bottom of the jar. Make the decorations: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch thick layer of white chocolate onto a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set until firm yet pliable but not hard. Use cookie cutters, round cutters or a paring knife to cut shapes like triangles and circles into the chocolate. When the chocolate sets, remove the acetate and set aside the shapes. Make the round ball: Use a plastic dome mold that is about 1 1/4-inch deep and 3-inches in diameter. Use a ladle to fill a mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Use tempered chocolate to glue the dome halves together to form a ball. Use a hot cutter to create a hole in the ball so the ball will sit at the tip of the cone. Paint the decorations: If you want to paint the chocolate, mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Place the paint in the airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired. If you do not have an airbrush, you can use a paintbrush to paint the decorations, applying color where you are inspired to do so. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the painted decorations to the outside of the cookie jar.

Combine the cake flour and salt in a medium bowl and sift together 5 times. Set aside. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until frothy (lots of bubbles but still liquid and loose). Add the cream of tartar and beat on high until stiff, 4 to 5 minutes. With the mixer on medium low, slowly sprinkle in the sifted granulated sugar. Fold in the sifted flour mixture gently until it&#39;s all combined. Sprinkle the vanilla into the bowl and fold gently. Spoon the batter into an angel food or tube pan (preferably with cooling legs)--make sure there&#39;s no grease or butter in there! Smooth the top and bake until a wooden skewer stuck all the way to the bottom comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. (Don&#39;t open the oven while it&#39;s baking!) Carefully remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert it onto its cooling legs (see Cook&#39;s Note). Let the cake cool completely while upside-down. For the frosting: Beat the powdered sugar, butter and cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer until very light and fluffy. Add a few drops of yellow food coloring as desired. Carefully remove the cake from the pan and transfer it to a cake plate upside-down, so that the end that was stuck to the bottom of the pan is now facing up.

Gently toss together 2 tablespoons of the oil, the vinegar, thyme, garlic, tomatoes, red peppers and onions on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange the tomatoes and red peppers skin-side up and bake until lightly charred, 45 to 50 minutes. Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the tomato paste and mix well. Add the tomato and pepper mixture, including the juices, and combine. Stir in the stock; cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, about 20 minutes. Transfer the soup to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and pulse in small batches that reach only about one-third to halfway up the side of the jar. Be careful to start slow and then increase the speed to blitz the ingredients until smooth. Use a separate bowl to hold the blended soup, and then return it all to the pot. Heat the soup to warm through, and then ladle into serving bowls. Garnish with the basil and serve with the Herbed Flatbread. Roll the pizza dough out to about 1-inch thick. Sprinkle evenly with the herbs and roll into a log. Then knead 3 to 4 minutes to evenly incorporate the herbs. Reform the dough into a ball and place in a small bowl lightly coated with olive oil. Set aside to rest for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter with the garlic and red onions. Remove from the heat and keep warm.

Alternatively, you can use a bamboo steamer or a large saucepan fitted with a steamer basket. Bring the brown slab sugar and 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons of cold water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally as the slab sugar tends to stick to the bottom of the pot, and cook until the sugar melts. Turn off the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set aside to cool until no longer steaming, about 6 minutes. Mix both kinds of rice flours together in a large bowl and set aside. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Line the bottom of the pan with a parchment circle and lightly grease the parchment with more vegetable oil. Set aside. Gradually add the sugar syrup to the rice flours in three additions, stirring with a rubber spatula until there are only a few small lumps of flour. The mixture will be stiff at the beginning but will loosen after stirring for about 1 minute. Strain the batter through a fine-mesh sieve set over another large bowl. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and cover with aluminum foil. Place the pan over the steamer and steam over medium heat until the cake is light brown and almost translucent, about 2 hours; refill the steamer after every 10 to 15 minutes as the water evaporates. The classic way to check for doneness is by taking a small piece from the center of the cake with a chopstick (or a butter knife) and then placing a dried red date on top of the hole to hide it and provide a kind of decoration. Remove the pan from the steamer and set aside until cool enough to handle. Flip the nian gao onto a large plate, peel off the parchment and invert onto a serving plate. To serve right away, cut the cake into 1/2-inch-thick wedges using a greased knife. Enjoy the bouncy texture. For pan-fried nian gao, allow the cake to cool completely and, without slicing, cover the cake with foil. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight. Slice into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Pan-fry in a lightly greased nonstick skillet over medium heat, flipping halfway through, until browned in spots, about 10 minutes. Enjoy while hot for the perfect chewy texture and serve with condensed milk if desired as a dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70502,&quot;Beer Shrimp Boil 3 (12-ounce) bottles lager beer 1 cup water 1 tablespoon shrimp boil seasoning or Creole seasoning mix 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 lemon, juiced, halves reserved 1 stick unsalted butter 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, head and shell left on, rinsed well Instructions: In a large pot, bring the beer, water, shrimp boil seasoning, salt, peppercorns and the juiced lemon halves to a boil over medium heat. Allow mixture to boil covered for 10 minutes. In the meantime, melt butter in a small saucepan and add the lemon juice. Add the shrimp to the pot of boiling beer, cover, and turn off heat. Check shrimp after 3 minutes for a pink color throughout. Using a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp and transfer to serving bowls. Add 1/2 cup of the beer boiling liquid to the butter and simmer for 2 minutes, then transfer to small serving bowls.

Cook, whisking occasionally and skimming any foam that rises to the top, until very thick, about 20 minutes. Lower the heat as the orange juice reduces to avoid burning. Whisk in the honey about 15 minutes into cooking, or whenever the foaming subsides. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and let cool slightly. Whisk in the lime juice, olive oil and 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Taste -- it should be sour but balanced; whisk in a bit more honey if needed. Let sit at room temperature while you make the rest of the dish. (The sauce can be made up to 2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.) For the martini relish: Combine the olives, peppers, shallots, jalapeno, dill, parsley, olive oil, vinegar and some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Let sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. (The relish can be made up to 1 day in advance without the dill and parsley; store in the refrigerator. Add the herbs just before serving.) For the crispy herbed couscous: Put 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the couscous, remove from the heat, cover and let sit for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Heat the oil in a medium nonstick pan until it shimmers. Add the cooked couscous and press into an even layer. Cook without stirring until the couscous becomes lightly golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Flip the couscous with a spatula; it will break up, but that&#39;s OK -- you want to get as much of the crispy bottom on top now. Cook, pressing occasionally, to crisp the second side, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss in the pan to break up the crispy bits, then remove from the heat. Toss with the dill and parsley. For the parchment-steamed grouper: Remove the fish from the refrigerator 15 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut four large parchment paper circles or hearts. Place each piece of fish slightly off-center on a piece of parchment. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, scatter with parsley leaves and torn dill, and drizzle with olive oil and white wine. Fold the parchment over the fish and crimp the edges tightly in 1/4-inch folds to create a half-moon shape. Make sure you press as you crimp and fold to seal the packets well; otherwise, the steam will escape. Arrange the packets on a baking pan and bake for exactly 7 minutes. Using oven mitts, place each packet on a dinner plate. Let sit for 1 minute, then carefully open the parchment. Drizzle with sour orange sauce and top with martini relish, followed by a touch more of the sauce. Sprinkle couscous around and on top of the fish.

Pour over the cherry brandy so that the cake soaks it up, and then top with the drained cherries. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to macerate while you make the custard. Melt the chocolate on low to medium heat in the microwave, checking after 2 minutes, though it will probably need 4 minutes. Or you can place it in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Once the chocolate is melted, ser aside while you get on with the custard. In a saucepan warm the milk and cream. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, and cocoa in a large bowl. Pour the warm milk and cream into the bowl whisking it into the yolks and sugar mixture. Stir in the melted chocolate, scraping the sides well with a rubber spatula to get all of it in, and pour the custard back into the rinsed saucepan. Cook over a medium heat until the custard thickens, stirring all the time. Make sure it doesn&#39;t boil, as it will split and curdle. Keep a sink full of cold water so that if you get scared you can plunge the bottom of the custard pan into the cold water and whisk like mad, which will avert possible crisis. The custard will get darker as it cooks and the flecks of chocolate will melt once the custard has thickened. And you do need this thick, so don&#39;t panic so much that you stop cooking while it is still runny. Admittedly, it continues to thicken as it cools and also when it&#39;s chilling in the refrigerator. Once it is ready, pour into a bowl to cool and cover the top of the custard with cling wrap to prevent a skin from forming. When the custard is cold, pour and spread it over the chocolate cake layer in the trifle bowl, and leave in the refrigerator to set, covered in plastic wrap overnight. When you are ready to decorate, softly whip the cream for the topping and spread it gently over the layer of custard. Grate the chocolate over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 70522,&quot;Mille-Feuille with Vanilla Pastry Cream and Bourbon Sauce 3 cups whole milk 7 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped, pod reserved or 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch 4 large egg yolks 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced 2 cups bourbon 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped, pod reserved or 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce package), thawed All-purpose flour, for dusting 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/2 pint raspberries Confectioners\\u2019 sugar, for garnish Instructions: For the pastry cream: In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, granulated sugar, salt and vanilla seeds and pod.

Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 70528,&quot;The Best Hot Chocolate 1 pint milk 2 tablespoons the best hot chocolate powder A handful of marshmallows Instructions: Firstly, put a pan of milk on to the heat. Bring to a simmer, not a boil, and while it&#39;s heating, put a tablespoon of chocolate powder into each mug. Add a little warmish milk from the pan to each mug, you just need enough to dissolve the chocolate powder. At this point, plonk a few marshmallows into each mug. When the milk is at a simmer, carefully pour it into a plastic jug or flask. I normally do this over a sink as I always end up spilling a bit (the trick is to have a big enough jug or flask so the milk only half fills it: you need the extra space for shaking and frothing). Screw the lid on tightly, place a cloth over the lid for safety, and shake hard for a minute. Remove the lid, minding the steam, and pour into your mugs. A little stir and you can slurp your way to heaven! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage]&quot; 70529,&quot;Cheese-Stuffed Arepas Kosher salt 2 cups pre-cooked white corn meal, such as P.A.N.<br> 4 ounces part-skim mozzarella, cut into 8 cubes 1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Stir together 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Gradually add the corn meal into the water, using your fingers to stir and combine, until a soft and moist dough forms.<br> Divide the dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each into a patty about 5-inches wide and 1/4-inch-thick.<br> Put a cube of mozzarella in the center of each patty. Fold the dough over the cheese, making sure the cheese is completely covered and sealed. Pat it back down until 3-inches wide and 1/2-inch-thick (see Cook&#39;s Note). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook the corn patties, until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side (making sure the oil is hot for each batch). Transfer to a cooling rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the edges are crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 70530,&quot;Parmesan Fried Onion Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup milk<br> 2 large eggs<br> 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish<br> 2 teaspoons paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 large sweet onion, such as Vidalia<br> Chopped fresh Italian parsley, for garnish<br> Mayonnaise, for dunking<br> Instructions: Fill a large pot or Dutch oven with enough oil to submerge the onion, with space around the sides for it to \\bloom.\\ (You might need up to a gallon, depending on the size of your onion, but don&#39;t worry; you can strain the oil and use it again for frying, so it won&#39;t go to waste.) Preheat to 400 degrees F. Combine the milk, eggs, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of pepper in a medium bowl. Whisk to combine. Combine the flour, Parmesan, paprika, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of pepper in a large bowl. Toss with a fork to combine. Cut off the top of the onion and place cut-side down. Think of the onion as the face of a clock, and cut slits at noon, 3, 6 and 9, cutting almost but not quite to the center of the onion. You&#39;ll now have 4 quadrants. Cut 3 more slits in each quadrant, once again cutting almost but not quite to the center of the onion. Flip the onion and gently separate the \\petals\\ with your fingers. Put the onion in the flour mixture and sprinkle it over and around to coat, gently separating the petals as needed to completely coat it. Put the onion in the egg wash and coat evenly in the egg, opening the petals again as needed. Let the excess egg wash drip back in the bowl. Put the onion in the flour once more and sprinkle it over and around to coat, making sure to keep the petals as separate as you can. Use a large spider to lower the onion, cut-side up, into the hot oil. The temperature of the oil will immediately begin to drop. Adjust the heat so the oil stays around 350 to 360 degrees F for the remainder of frying. With a fork, separate the petals a bit more, if needed. Fry the onion until the tips are golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Use the spider to gently flip the onion and continue to fry until the entire onion is crisp, deep golden and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Transfer the onion while still hot to a serving plate. Season with salt and pepper. Shower with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan. Serve with mayo for dunking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70531,&quot;Pineapple-Raspberry Rum Refresher 2 tablespoons frozen raspberries 1/4 cup ice cubes 3 ounces coconut water 3 ounces pineapple juice 1 ounce light rum 2 fresh mint leaves Instructions: Gently muddle the raspberries in a pretty footed glass.

In a food processor, process the ice cubes with the salt, pepper, allspice, nutmeg, thyme and garlic. Slowly add the pork to the food processor and pulse until a chunky farce is achieved. (The temperature should not exceed 40 degrees F. during mixing.) Fold the cornichons and ham into mixture sausage mixture. Place 24 inches of plastic wrap on a work surface. Place the farce in the center of the plastic and roll into an 18-inch log. Twist and tie the ends of the plastic and poach the farce at 185 degrees F until the internal temp reaches 152 degrees F. Immerse the sausage loaf in an ice bath and allow to cool. For the liver pate: Sear the chicken livers until cooked to medium but still very pink inside. To a bowl, add the egg and yolk, cornichon juice, garlic and1 teaspoon salt. Blend with an immersion blender, slowly adding the oil to create an emulsion. About halfway through, add the livers one at a time. Continue adding the oil until a smooth, thick texture is achieved. Chill until ready to use. For the pickled vegetables: In a bowl, combine the carrots, red onions, parsley, cornichon juice and salt to taste. Set aside to marinate.

Set aside. Combine the cornmeal, flour, both sugars, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl, then whisk and set aside. In another bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, honey and melted butter. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients; mix until combined. Fold in the jalapenos. Pour into the greased pan, then smooth with a spatula and bake, 10 minutes. Rotate the pan and continue to bake until risen and golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes more. Set aside to cool. For the rib eye and red bean chili: Meanwhile, cut the rib eye into medium dice and add to a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and 2 teaspoons garlic salt. Heat 3 ounces olive oil in the bottom of a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until hot. Add the seasoned meat, in batches if needed, and brown on all sides, about 3 minutes. Remove the meat from the pot, then set aside in a bowl and add the remaining 2 ounces oil to the pot; heat until hot. Add the garlic and onions and stir until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the tomato paste until combined, then pour in the beans and crushed tomatoes, stirring to combine. Stir in the beef broth, oregano, cumin, chili powder, butter, 1 tablespoon kosher salt and the remaining 2 teaspoons garlic salt. Bring to a low simmer and cook to concentrate flavors, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the browned meat, then cover. Allow to simmer for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, crumble the cornbread into bite-sized pieces. Ladle individual servings of chili into bowls. Top with the Cheddar and crumbled cornbread, then drizzle with the sour cream. Garnish with the scallions and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 70535,&quot;Hot Tamales 1/4 cup chili powder 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 2 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon freshly toasted and ground cumin seed 2 pounds Boston butt meat, untrimmed 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced 4 to 5 dozen dried corn husks 2 pounds yellow cornmeal, approximately 6 cups 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon baking powder 7 1/2 ounces lard, approximately 1 cup 3 to 4 cups reserved cooking liquid Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, kosher salt, paprika, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper and cumin. Divide the mixture in half and reserve 1 half for later use. Cut the Boston butt into 6 even pieces and place into a 6 to 8-quart saucepan. Add half of the spice mixture and enough water, 3 to 3 1/2 quarts, to completely cover the meat. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the meat is very tender and falling apart, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the meat from the cooking liquid to a cutting board. Leave the cooking liquid in the pot. Both meat and liquid need to cool slightly before making dough and handling. Remove any large pieces of fat and shred the meat into small pieces, pulling apart with your hands or using 2 forks. Place a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Once shimmering, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are semi-translucent, approximately 3 minutes. Add the garlic, jalapeno, and remaining half of the spice mixture and continue to cook for another minute. Add the meat and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. While the meat is cooking, place the husks in a large bowl or container and submerge completely in hot water. Soak the husks until they are soft and pliable, at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours. For the dough: Place the cornmeal, salt, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl and combine. Add the lard and using your hands, knead together until the lard is well incorporated into the dry mixture. Gradually add enough of the reserved cooking liquid, 3 to 4 cups to create a dough that is like thick mashed potatoes. The dough should be moist but not wet. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and set aside until ready to use. To assemble the tamales: Remove a corn husks from the water and pat dry to remove excess water. Working in batches of 6, lay the husks on a towel and spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough in an even layer across the wide end of the husk to within 1/2-inch of the edges. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture in a line down the center of the dough. Roll the husk so the dough surrounds the meat, then fold the bottom under to finish creating the tamale. Repeat until all husks, dough and filling are used. Tie the tamales, around the center, individually or in groups of 3, with kitchen twine. To cook the tamales: Stand the tamales upright on their folded ends, tightly packed together, in the same saucepan used to cook the meat. Add the reserved broth from making the dough and any additional water so the liquid comes to 1-inch below the tops of the tamales. Try not to pour the broth directly into the tops of the tamales. Cover, place over high heat and bring to a boil, approximately 12 minutes. Remove the lid, reduce the heat to low, to maintain a low simmer, and cook until the dough is firm and pulls away easily from the husk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Serve the tamales warm. For a &#39;wet&#39; hot tamale, serve with additional simmering liquid. Store leftover tamales, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, in the freezer, for up to a month. To reheat, remove the plastic wrap and steam until heated through.; &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 70536,&quot;White Chocolate Cake with Fresh Raspberries 6 cups sifted cake flour 2 tablespoons baking powder 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter 3 cups sugar 12 egg whites 2 cups milk 1 teaspoon clear vanilla extract 2 cups non-dairy whipping cream 1/4 cup white chocolate dots 1/2 cup solid vegetable shortening 1/2 cup unsalted butter softened 1 teaspoon clear vanilla extract 4 cups powdered sugar 2 tablespoons cream Fresh raspberries Instructions: For cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Spread the hazelnuts in a single layer in a shallow pan and place them in the preheated oven, turning every now and again, until lightly toasted and the skins begin to blister, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Then, working in batches, rub them between the palms of your hands until the skins loosen and fall away. (This will take some time and not every bit of skin will rub off.) Chop the hazelnuts coarsely. Using a nut mill, blender, or a food processor fitted with the metal blade, grind the hazelnuts to a fine powder. (If the nuts do become oily, pass them through a sieve to break up any lumps.) Place in a large mixing bowl and stir in the sugar. Add the butter, cocoa, honey, and vanilla and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Add the egg whites, a little at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add only enough of the whites for the dough to take on the consistency of a loose paste or spritz cookie dough. Do not worry if all of the egg whites are not used. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or grease them with butter. Spoon the hazelnut mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a No. 6 star tip. Pipe out rosettes 1 inch in diameter onto the prepared sheets, spacing the rosettes about 1 1/2 inches apart. You should have about 60 rosettes in all. Let the rosettes sit, uncovered, at room temperature overnight. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until firm to the touch but still moist inside, 8 to 10 minutes. When they are done they will not brown and may even look undercooked, so you must test by touch. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in the top pan of a double boiler placed over simmering water. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Gently turn half of the cookies top sides down on a flat surface and spread about 1/2 teaspoon chocolate on each of the upturned bottoms. As each cookie is coated, press a plain cookie onto the chocolate, bottom side down, to form a \\sandwich. Lay the cookies on their sides on a tray or flat plate and refrigerate for 15 minutes to set the chocolate. Store in a covered container, at room temperature, for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 70546,&quot;Sticky Toffee Pudding with Butterscotch Sauce 12 ounces dates, pitted and roughly chopped 2 1/2 cups water 2 teaspoons baking soda 3 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 8 tablespoons (1 stick) softened, unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 2/3 cups granulated sugar 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Butterscotch sauce, recipe follows 2 1/4 cups light brown sugar 7 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup half-and-half 1 teaspoon brandy 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup cold heavy cream, optional Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Turn off the heat and gradually stir in the baking soda (it will foam up), and set aside. In a bowl, combine the flour and baking powder. In the bowl of a mixer, cream the butter until fluffy. Add the sugar to the butter, and cream until fluffy. Without stopping the mixer, add 2 of the eggs and mix until combined. Add the remaining 2 eggs and vanilla and mix until combined. Add about 1/3 of the flour mixture and 1/3 of the dates and mix until combined. Repeat until all the flour mixture and the dates are incorporated into the batter. Pour into the baking pan and bake about 40 minutes, until firm and set in the center. Let cool in the pan. When cool, turn out of the pan onto a baking sheet and peel off the parchment paper. The recipe can be made through this step up to 2 days in advance. Butterscotch Sauce: Combine the brown sugar, butter, half-and-half, and brandy in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil 3 minutes, until combined. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. When ready to serve pudding, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Pour the sauce evenly over the top of the cake. Bake until the sauce is bubbly and cake is heated through, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whip the heavy cream into soft peaks with the mixer. Cut the cake into squares and serve with whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 70547,&quot;Dijon Chicken with Grape Salad 1 lb. grilled chicken meat, sliced 2 cups California seedless grapes 3/4; cup celery, sliced 1/4 cup green onion, sliced 4 oz. mixed honey-roasted nuts 1/3 cup prepared honey-dijon dressing 4-6 cups salad greens or chopped romaine lettuce Instructions: In a large bowl, toss together chicken, grapes, celery, green onion and nuts with the dressing.
