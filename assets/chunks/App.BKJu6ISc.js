As delicious as it is, it just lacks that extra punch of intensity.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"For this attractive price and this classy presentation, you can't go wrong.

Drink this flashy Chardonnay now.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"I've always been partial to Magnificat, not only because it's such a grand wine, but because the price is moderate for Napa, and they haven't raised it for years.

It's certainly a complex, balanced, elegant wine, and quite drinkable now. But it should hold and even improve for a decade.","province":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"It's nice to know that some aun wineries and importers have kept a lid on prices.

It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids. The peach, tropical fruit, pear, candied ginger and charry oak flavors have an acidic scour. Drink now and for the next 5 years.","province":"California"},{"country":"ar","description":"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"ar","description":"Initial aromas of clove and cinnamon suggest a lot of barrel action, but give it a few minutes and the wine settles on ripe black fruit, dark spice notes and richness. It's big-boned but not overly tannic, and it exhibits Shiraz's bacon and espresso character in a good way.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"fr","description":"A complex wine that is influenced by wood, but shows more of fresh lime and white currants.

This young wine shares a similar high acid tang with its much older sibling, reminiscent of fresh orange juice, and the acids are wrapped into tannic, medium dark cherry fruit.

It promises good things in the future.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"ar","description":"Cola, blackberry and cassis dominate the bouquet, with cedar making a cameo.

What a California experience.","province":"California"},{"country":"za","description":"The second vintage from this joint venture between Remhoogte owner Murray Boustred and new partner Michel Rolland.

The tannins are polished, the fruit is ripe and complex, the oak is elaborate, and there's a nice bite of acidity in the background.

The score reflects potential.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Longplay's 2008 reserve is quite different from its non-?reserve stablemate. The aromas include more earthy barnyard scents, the color has a hint of maturity, and no new oak was used.

What's especially nice about this bottling is the dryness and moderate alcohol. A superior wine that should age for the better part of a decade.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Four vineyards C Ribbon Ridge, Momtazi, Maresh and Shea C are included here. Soft and seductive, this wine caresses the palate with silky fruit. Aromatically it weaves together red fruits, truffles and clean, earthy scents.

Once again the fruit is crystal clear, setting up fresh pear, green apple and pink grapefruit flavors against crisp, juicy acidity. The finish is lively and spicy.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Bella Vetta's 2005 was very good. This 2006 is easily on a par. It's a ripe, plush wine, filled with blackberry, currant and sweet oak flavors with a savory tease of leather that may be a touch of brett, but it acts as a spice. And look how modern techniques have tamed those fierce Howell Mountain tannins. The mouthfeel is sheer velvet.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"Supple but structured, this is only the third vintage for Felton Road's Cornish Point Pinot and it is really starting to hit its stride.

Almost sweet on the finish, the wine redeems itself with elegance. The high alcohol isn't really a problem, in terms of balance.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Made in a fuller style than is customary with Prosecco, with granular aromas of baked apple and peaches.

Big-boned and firmly structured, drink 2008C09.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"gr","description":"Made in an Old World style, this dry, earthy wine has aromas of vanilla and Asian spice, eucalyptus and earth that picks up secondary aromas with time. The tannins are developed, the wine having spent plenty of time in wood, while the palate has a medium weight and good acidity.

This is a wine that needs a decanter or time in the glass to open up, and can be drunk over the next five years.","province":"gr"},{"country":"ar","description":"Gets going with a lot of barrel and leather, but maybe not as much fruit as one might hope for.

Cocoa and cherry flavors linger prettily on the finish.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"it","description":"Often, extra dry Prosecco offers a deceptively sweet bouquet. Part of the reason for this is that smaller percentages of Chardonnay, Verdisio and Bianchetta have been added to the Prosecco blend. That is the case here, though this wine has a broader, fuller nose with ripe peach, honey, flowers and a chalky element.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"gr","description":"One of gr's biggest wine exporters, Boutari has the formula for smooth, accessible wines.

Brisk passion fruit, grapefruit and herb flavors finish crisp and clean.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry and elegant, this Pinot has a Central Coast feeling, with a pale color and brisk acidity.

So drink soon.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"it","description":"Who says a simple, no-fuss white can't speak of its terroir? This quaffable Sardinian wine, deeply redolent of dried sage, oregano, natural rubber and those funny cigarettes people smoked in the 1960s, speaks loads about the arid, brush-covered island it comes from.

An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"au","description":"In an unusual twist, Yalumba's m/g/s gives Mourvdre preeminence in the blend (60%), followed by 22% Grenache and 18% Shiraz. The result is a wine that lightens some of Mourvdre's dark fruit and tree-bark tendencies with a dash of raspberries.

It brings the same dark, smoky, espresso-loaded scents and flavors, but it is sleeker, the acid more apparent (though actually a bit lower) and the tannins left to hang in the finish. This is a fine companion to the Merlot, but needs a juicy steak or rich sauce to cut the tannins.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"de","description":"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity.

Round and vigorous in the mouth, with vibrant dark-berry flavors. A muscled-up wine from Salta with just enough finesse to balance everything out. Ready to drink.","province":"Other"},{"country":"US","description":"Easy to ripen, hard to achieve balance and elegance. That's Viognier, and Iron Horse does one of the better jobs. That's because in addition to tropical fruit, citrus, flower and spicy flavors, the wine is very dry and acidic. In this case there's a bit of oak but just enough to add a touch of cream.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Light lemon-lime and slight mineral aromas lead to standard apple, lime and orange-zest flavors.

Delicious now.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"es","description":"Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice. This is a meaty, hot wine with maple and resin on the finish.

There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola.

More than 12,000 cases were made.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the least of Brookdale's Cabs since the 2000 vintage, mainly because it's overly soft, with a baked, raisiny taste to the blackberries and cherries.

It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"This stainless-steel fermented wine, from several different Willamette Valley vineyards, reaches a surprising 15.5% alcohol, and tastes like it. There is a sharpness to the flavors that, despite the wine's being somewhat chilled, comes across as alcoholic heat. It's varietal and tastes of fresh fruit, but has some high-toned volatility as well.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a classic example of why Americans are buying Pinot Grigio.

The pineapple and citrus flavors are solid and the finish holds onto the Verdejo's citrusy profile. Steady and clean all the way through.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"au","description":"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity.

There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats.","province":"South au"},{"country":"es","description":"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish.

Imported by Freixenet, USA.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"au","description":"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean.","province":"Western au"},{"country":"US","description":"Much like the winery's pleasing Pinot Gris, this Dijon clone Chard is made in a clean, lightly herbal style.

It gets it two-thirds right; the nose and color are there but the mouthfeel is lacking.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"fr","description":"This single-vineyard blanc de blancs premier cru is, curiously, more mature than the 1997 version of the same wine.

On the minus side, the wine is too soft, lacking the vital acidity and tannins needed for structure.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"There are only a few pockets of vineyard land in it with the correct levels of fog or moisture for noble rot (botrytis) and the Marche is one of them.

From the Ballard Canyon section of the valley, it has 4% Syrah, and a small percentage of new oak that adds a smoky, caramelly richness to the blackberry, cherry and raspberry fruit flavors.

It has power, but gentle power, with rounded corners and a texture that is dense, never hard. The fruits are ripe plums, perhaps lacking final freshness.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"US","description":"High alcohol, approaching 16%, compromises this wine.

The tannins form an almost creamy texture in the mouth, and the finish lingers a good long time.

The wood shows through on the finish.","province":"Douro"},{"country":"US","description":"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere.

The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Five years ago we said Domus Aurea could become one of cl's very best Cabernets. But then focus, winemakers and other things changed and the quality slipped. But Domus seems to be back with a vengeance in 2003.

Still not for everyone, but very, very interesting and not generic.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"fr","description":"Toasty on the nose, accented by hints of peach, then turning honeyed and rich on the palate, with a slightly oily texture.

This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character.

And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors.

Only 25 cases made.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"The name is a combination of eiswein and Scheurebe, the German variety. The grapes were artificially frozen.

It's a fine example of what Washington can do with Riesling, bringing bright, sappy fruit flavors to vibrant acidity, complex sugars and a lingering liveliness on the palate. If this is any indication of what this vineyard (and Chelan in general) is capable of producing, Washington has found its next great Riesling appellation.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet.

It has been for almost a decade, but now that it's pushing $100 we are looking at it quite critically.

There are also nicely integrated tones of exotic spice and mesquite wood at the back.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark, tannic and full-bodied, this five grape Bordeaux blend from a classic Washington vintage is 100% Alder Ridge fruit.

A multi-clone blend (hence the name) with high, cool-climate acidity and aged in 100% new oak, it's still young, fresh and tight. The astringency throws a cloak over the raspberries, cherries, rosehip tea and Indian spice flavors, which reveal themselves only reluctantly.

It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014.

Aged in barrique.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"This may be the most expensive Malbec in California, but it's a really good wine that is full-bodied and deeply flavored.

The stiff and lean tannins indicate that this will benefit from some cellaring.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"A wine that caresses the palate with initial silky, ripe-fruit flavors and then comes on with structure and acidity.

Defines the world-class status of Santa Rita Pinot.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"It was fun comparing this Cab with the winery's '02 Claret.

Try in a few months.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Foxen has co-released three single-vineyard Pinots, and to my mind this is the best. It's the most closed, tannic and complex, a dark, brooding wine whose depths have swirls of black stone fruits, sweet leather, mocha, spice and oak. It drinks rich and satisfying now, and should develop well over the next five years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Tough and tannic now, and not yielding much, this 96% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in Mayacamas Mountains vineyards. Yet there's a tremendous core of cherry and blackberry fruit, and a rich spine of acidity to hold the wine for aging. Designed for 10 years in the cellar.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Despite its 1.9% residual sugar, this is succulent, not sweet. An ex- ceptionally fragrant wine, lush with blossoms, sweet peach, mango and pear. Beautifully ripened and concentrated; vibrant so that it seems to shimmer in the mouth, like a wave breaking over the palate. Poised, racy, fruity and sensuous, it just goes on and on.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Where Lang & Reed's '03 Cab Franc is elegant and light-bodied, this is fuller and more complex, although it has nowhere near the weight of a Cabernet Sauvignon. The silky texture carries flavors of cherries, tobacco, sweet kid leather and thyme. Enjoy this dry, slightly tannic wine with grilled veal chops in a wine reduction sauce with mushrooms.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Richly colored in hues of amber and gold, with a toasty, full-bodied nose that offers maturity and depth. This Champagne is totally on the money, with ripe but reserved apple and citrus flavors, and then the slightest bit of mushroom and baked bread on the finish. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"The Dutton-Goldfield style is to emphasize acidity and minerality, then to lavish winemaker interventions in the form of oak and lees. This is a Chablisian wine, if you will, dry and crisp, with complex flavors ranging from lemons and cinnamon to gun metal and pineapples. It's very elegant and food-friendly.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's regular Pinot, which was released at the same time, is a light, fruity wine. This one's darker, deeper, more ominous. It's a controlled explosion of black cherry, mocha, spice and char in the mouth, enormously attractive and sensual.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Really good claret, in a Napa-Bordeaux sense.

This beguiling wine is like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in consummate artistry.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a best-of selection from this vineyard. It's a concentrated version of the regular Double L bottling.

Should develop well through 2008 and possibly beyond.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Classy from the get-go, with an appealing mix of strawberry preserves, anise, licorice candy, smoke and cedar.

It's still in an early estery phase right now, marked by honeyed tropical fruits, nectarines and grapefruit, but you can sense the herbal-jalape?o flavors lurking in the background. Rich and powerful on the palate, long on the finish, with this wine, Cloudy Bay is on top of its game.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"An elegant and tart, cool-climate style of Syrah. Betz wines are always carefully structured and beautifully proportioned, and the winery has not over-reached in this somewhat difficult vintage. Extra hang time ripened the fruit while retaining good acids and flavors of boysenberry, sour cherry and raspberry. Hints of coffee and gravel add complexity. Best for relatively near-term enjoyment.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"This is still quite dark in color, right to the rim, and it overflows with complex aromas of flowers, herbs, tobacco, cassis and subtle oaking.

It doesn't have that sumptuously soft, sexy quality a ready-to-drink Cab shows. But it's rich and balanced, with a core of cassis, cherry and coffee flavors, and should age well. Hold until 2009.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"You can smell the minerals in this tight, compelling wine. It has an aroma suggesting cold metal, even a touch of diesel, floating above the guava, pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors. Smoky oak and zesty acidity help make this Chard very complex and satisfying.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Bso is kiss, soleil is sun; the name is made up to signify sun-kissed. The grapes are from Alder Ridge, with 14% Syrah from Red Mountain blended in. Just 82 cases were made. It's a juicy, delicious tangle of red fruits and berries, with a spicy highlight. As it unfolds you notice the fruit is lined with citrus, orange peel and clove, then finished with sweet oak.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the most accessible of Calera's current single-vineyard releases, a real charmer with its creamy cherry, mocha and oaky vanilla flavors.

As with all Calera Pinots, this wine is elegantly structured.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This single-vineyard Chardonnay impresses for its taut structure and promise of aging.

The result is more complexity than in the \\"regular\\" Limited Release Cab and a firmer, chewier finish that suggests cellaring 4-7 years prior to consumption. It's full and creamy-textured on the palate, with aromas and flavors that hint at smoke, cassis, tobacco, cedar and a multitude of dried spices. Should be great, starting in 2010. Only problem? Just 75 cases were produced.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Charles Krug's Limited Release program sets a new level of quality for this Napa stalwart. This Cabernet Sauvignon boasts plenty of smoky oak on the nose, but also bold cassis fruit and hints of vanilla and tobacco.

Supple, spicy and long on the finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This inky wine barely meets the labeling requirements for Syrah (the balance is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot), but still boasts plenty of that grape's varietal character in its slightly peppery scents, meaty flavors and blackberry and mulberry fruit.

It's a huge, deep wine, brilliant in black currant, green olive and cocoa flavors, yet packed in big-time mountain tannins that pretty much shut it down on the finish.

Cranberry, pomegranate and cherry meet rock, gravel and pepper. Lovely focus and purity; it's concentrated and tight, with a minerality that is compelling and distinctive. The best yet from Cailloux.

It's a world-class effort, still quite young and tight, but built for beautiful aging.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"I liked Morgan's Double L Chard for its Chablis-like character. This wine is more so. It's drier, more acidic and more elegant, but there's nothing lean about the power of its core of tropical fruit, which detonates on the palate and doesn't stop.

One of the best Gewrzes in the state, if not the country.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This brilliantly fruity wine shows South Coast Chardonnay-like flavors in the ripe mango, papaya and peach, and also showcases cool-climate acidity that makes that fruit sing on the palate.

Sophisticated and smooth, with plenty of tannic grip.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Well, this is your basic inky dark, tannic Pet wine, from a producer with a long track record.

In an era of gooey, late-picked wines, this one's dry, tight and tannic, obviously designed for the cellar.

Powerful without being overblown.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Pop a steak on the grill and enjoy this robust wine. A blend of Dry Creek, Russian River, Alexander Valley and Knights Valley fruit, with a little Paso Robles thrown in for good measure, it's classic Zin, dry, fruity and peppery.

Maybe it's the velvety softness, or the touch of toasted wood, or the flavors that suggest sun-ripened blackberries. Whatever it is, it's easy and delicious, but quite complex.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Very similar in terroir-driven flavors to Rusack's less expensive Chardonnay, with citrus and orange blossom flavors, a steely, minerally note and modest oak. The structure is more angular, with very high acidity leading to a long finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Like a freight train, this wine from the village of Poboleda hits with force. From Joan Doix and his winemaking nephew, Ramn Llagostera, it deftly delivers both red and black fruit notes, all on a lightly tannic frame. To call it lip-smacking and juicy would be correct. The blend is 51% old-vines Garnacha, 46% Cari?ena and 3% Merlot. 500 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"es","description":"Ripe and rich; it pushes the limit toward raisiny but doesn't cross the boundary. As a result, the sweet bouquet oozes kirsch, licorice and spice. Stays thick on the palate, but not particularly heavy.

Chewy, dusty and aromatic, its herbal notes, offset with clean red fruits, suggest a Bordeaux more than a Napa style.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"So dry, so tart is this citrusy, high-acid wine that the palate begs for some morsel to soften it.

It has an especially nice, long and spicy finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Pendulum is a collaboration with Allen Shoup (Long Shadows), and that, plus the fact that this 1,500-case red wine is a mix of eight different varieties, suggests that it is crafted from barrels that did not make the final blend for Long Shadows.

Pleasant, especially for the new oak.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Young, fresh and jammy, this Syrah might benefit from a year or two in the cellar.

Needs time.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"If you're looking for an exotic, lush Viognier, this isn't the one.

Red berries, pepper and spice have zan character, and are enlivened by good acidity and a minerally finish. A refreshing but savory everyday red; pair with lamb or game.","province":"Philadelphia"},{"country":"za","description":"Cloves, black fruit and vanilla spice on the nose are followed by a brooding array of tobacco, spice, red berry and vanilla on the palate. Full-bodied but smooth, with a lingering, savory finish. Pair with steak, lamb or aged cheeses.","province":"Durbanville"},{"country":"US","description":"This unusual project releases just a single blended red wine annually. The wine is a Cabernet-dominated Bordeaux blend, but includes significant proportions of three different vintages.

It's set off by crisp acidity, and has rewarding flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, enriched with pineapples, figs and honeysuckle.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Dominated by Smillon, this is a rich, oily textured wine, full on and ripe. The wine has great flavors of apples, thyme, peppers, finishing with soft acidity.","province":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"US","description":"The Grenache is blended with 10% Syrah and 5% Mourvdre.

The finish shows more berry fruit characters.","province":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"US","description":"Bone dry, acidic and tannic, this wine will appeal to fans of structure rather than opulence.

A great wine for the price.","province":"Coastal Region"},{"country":"za","description":"This medium-body blend of Sauvignon, Chenin Blanc and Semillon offers tropical fruit flavors on the nose and the palate, along with a strain of spicy, toasted oak. There's dimension but still a dry, clean character on the palate and finish. Pair with seafood dishes.","province":"Coastal Region"},{"country":"nz","description":"This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc leans a bit toward the vegetal side of the spectrum, yet retains enough ripe character to balance the ledger. Fresh green pea and grapefruit aromas segue into intense, slightly vegetal flavors, but the underlying honey, peach and citrus notes even things out.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"Everything has come together in this polished, approachable wine. The tannins are brisk but sweetly ripe. Oak has been fully integrated, lending smoky vanilla to the cherry and licorice flavors. Crisp Carneros acidity makes everything bright and shiny.

This wine doesn't quite make it, its soft, round flavors missing the intensity. Even so, it is enjoyable, a riot of black fruits, soft tannins and touches of spicy wood.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"au","description":"For the Estate Chardonnay, crop yields were under 2 tons per acre, yielding concentrated flavors of nectarine and citrus.

Drink now.","province":"Victoria"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine clocks in at an impressive 15.2% alcohol.

The wine is just this side of high-toned, bright and assertive, and the fruit flavors are penetrating and last through a considerable finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a proud, modern Brunello Riserva that delivers strong and decisive oak tones including vanilla bean, toasted espresso, chocolate fudge and sweet spice that cast a shadow over the natural fruit flavors. The wine is balanced and has good harmony in the mouth, although those wood tones are very present here too. Lovers of traditional Brunello will not appreciate its big, oak-driven character.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"The wine is built around flavors of crisp citrus, white peach and green apple fruits, wrapped in a pleasing minerality.

Subtle peach and spice flavors finish long, adding a mineral component.","province":"Victoria"},{"country":"au","description":"Perplexing to evaluate, with hints of slightly roasted, overripe fruit yet starching tannins as well, making its future evolution unclear. Blackberry and chocolate flavors finish firm and hard-edged now, but does the fruit have the freshness to last? Drink now, with rare beef or lamb to help tame the tannins, or cellar until 2012.","province":"South au"},{"country":"fr","description":"The wine is dominated by its dry tannins, which ride over the less exuberant fruit.

Who could expect such intriguing aromas of chirimoya, peach and cinnamon? And the palate is gorged with fig, date and honey flavors. The only downside is that it's a little cloying as it warms.","province":"Molina"},{"country":"nz","description":"This Hawkes Bay-based winery has turned in an impressive effort from Marlborough-grown grapes, matching hints of green pea and mint with ripe melon and fig flavors. It's a bit broad on the palate, but regains focus and shows admirable length on the finish.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"This retains just a hint of green to the finish, but it more than compensates by being single vineyard, single varietalthe most pure and true expression of terroir. There is no place to hide in such a wine, and this is stripped naked. The fruit leans to tart blueberry, wrapped in leaf and a bit of stem; tannins are chewy and the finish is light but complex, showing soy, smoke, tar and leaf.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"This is an earthier, less overtly fruity rendition of McLaren Vale Shiraz, but one that still has plenty of merit. It's reasonably round and supple in texture, with flavors of black olive that coat the mouth and persist nicely on the finish.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Pinotphiles will appreciate that this was 100% destemmed for fermentation. The fruit is the star, suggesting freshly crushed blackberries, cherries, black raspberries and cola, spiced up with cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. An elegant sipper that gets better as it warms. Try decanting for a couple hours before serving.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This Chelan winery improves from vintage to vintage. This new Syrah is satiny and rich, with pliant flavors of mixed berry, cherry and stone fruit. The new oak adds smoke and toast, but the gamy, meaty and pungently herbal notes come from the grapes. Winemaker Larry Lehmbecker has crafted a seamless and complete wine that delivers a lot of pleasure for the price.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"Shows plenty of oak upfront, offering up scents of toasted coconut, maple syrup, coffee and vanilla, but underneath lies a dense layer of sturdy earth and black olive flavors. Tannins are soft enough to suggest early drinkability, but the fruit should hold another five or more years.","province":"South au"},{"country":"za","description":"Ripe, round aromas of melon and pineapple lead into a crisp, fresh and slightly flinty SB. This has length and complexity but is still light and clean. Its poised balance of minerality and appealing fruit makes it good for pairing or enjoying alone.","province":"Robertson"},{"country":"cl","description":"We haven't seen a VSC blend since 2001, and this shows more ripeness and clarity than in the past. Still, there's a mild whiff of green to the nose and palate, which prevents it from achieving a higher plateau. It's Cabernet with Syrah and Petit Verdot, and the end result features a healthy, lively mouthfeel and solid but lightly herbal cherry and berry flavors. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This succulent wine's bright, well-defined fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and citrus add life and lift across the entire palate. The fruit is the star here, and whatever new oak has been applied has been used well. There is just the right touch of butterscotch and toasted almond on the finish, but the fruit keeps the flavors rolling through the back of the palate for a long, leisurely ride.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"Fairly priced, this offers a full-bodied mouthful of ripe fruit and soft tannins. Blackberry and vanilla notes are followed by hints of caramel and cinnamon in the mouth. A drink-now wine that's easy to like.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Flavors open up immediately, ripe and sweet, with pretty cherry/berry fruit. Hints of a dark mineral and graphite undercurrent lead into a rather chalky finish, helped somewhat by a wash of chocolate that runs right through it.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"Winemaker Kate Goodman has turned a pretty Shiraz that starts off with spicy floral aromas, then adds rich blackberry fruit and a hint of meatiness. The tannins are soft and the finish is a touch short, so enjoy it over the near term.","province":"Victoria"},{"country":"fr","description":"Soft, generous and ripe, this is very Pinot Noir. Maybe it lacks density for a Vosne-Romane, but it is a delicious wine. The fruit is layered with black plum skin tannins, leaving the aftertaste of fresh acidity, balanced with dryness.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"cl","description":"Yellow Delicious apple and melon aromas start it off in a fruity direction, and the palate shows peach and pear flavors. With no oak, there's no butter, toast or resin to speak of. There is, however, a sugary almost Riesling-esque quality to the wine. All in all, it's unconventional but pretty good, with a nice bolt of acidity keeping it wide awake. Imported by T. Edward Wines.","province":"Molina"},{"country":"es","description":"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"This is typical of the appellation, a soft, gentle wine, with polished berry-cherry flavors. It's also dry, balanced and modest in alcohol, at a good price.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Its exceptional dryness and searing acidity make this wine a natural to drink as an apritif or with a wide range of food. It doesn't particularly taste like Riesling, though, more like a citrusy, minerally Albari?o or Pinot Grigio.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient. That doesn't mean it's a poor wine; but it emphasizes dry oak and saucy flavors as opposed to richness and ripeness. Best for Rioja traditionalists and those who might drink it with robust foods.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"au","description":"A bit on the lean side, and with some drying tannins on the finish, this is one wine in the Philip Shaw lineup that's less than impressive. Cola and earth notes overshadow the black cherry fruit, and there's a slight menthol edge to the flavors.","province":"New South Wales"},{"country":"US","description":"As always, a nice, easy-drinking Chard with plenty of Central Coast character. The cool, long hangtime has given very ripe fruit, while preserving vital acidity.

It's way too soft for aging, so drink now.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A good value for dryness and balance, and lots of tasty flavors. Blackberries, currants, cherries, milk chocolate, spice and smoky oak finish with a touch of tannins, suggesting pork or lamb.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Good everyday Zin, a little green, but rich enough in raspberry and cherry flavors with a hit of spice. The dryness and moderate alcohol win extra points.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"If you can handle the large-quantity characteristics that govern this wine, particularly olive, herbal notes and vegetal aromas and flavors, then it's pretty nice. For those opposed to traditional Bordeaux-style green notes, it's probably better to upgrade to Santa Rita's richer, riper Medalla Real. Good on the whole but not great; yet at 150,000 cases it's hard to expect better.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"pt","description":"Young, fresh and fruity, with vivid acidity, flavors of red currants and layered tannins.

It's a dry, balanced sipper whose charm is hard to describe. But it's there.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"There are so many good qualities to this wine that I wish it were more concentrated. With a very high production, the vines must have been stretched. Too bad, because it shows gorgeous structure of acids and tannins, the kind of Cabernet only Napa Valley can produce. Still, it rewards for elegance and modest blackberry and oak flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The words country style apply perfectly to this Rh?ne blend based on Mourvdre. It's soft and simple and dry, with pleasant cherry, blackberry and Kahlua flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"A rewarding mix of sweet red fruits and earthy chocolate is what this Syrah-Cabernet blend holds in store.

Drink now.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The vineyard has been the source of great Syrah, and while this is a good wine, it's not without flaws. Brilliantly ripe in black currants, cherries, cassis, chocolate, sweet leather and spices, it's dry and finely structured. But there's a scour of acid that disturbs its equilibrium.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Quite funky indeed.

Will be ready by the beginning of 2008.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"es","description":"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated. The palate is forward and basic, with tangy cherry and plum skin flavors. It thickens a bit on the finish but always has a racy personality. Better with food due to grabby tannins and acids.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Way too soft and ripe, and although it's technically dry, this tastes like a concoction of chocolate mousse, crme de cassis and cinnamon. Luscious, but it isn't really a dry table wine.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dark and dense, but also a touch warm and soupy. Air allows it to unfold and show boysenberry and plum flavors, while the feel is creamy, syrupy and flush.

A big-production wine at 45,000 cases.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Fancy name for a fairly simple wine. Crisp and fruity, it has slightly sweet citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, with polished acidity for balance.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft, simple and gentle, with sugary cherry pie and cola flavors. The silky texture and light mouthfeel are wonderful, but the wine would be far better if it finished drier and crisper.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking.

There's a little bit of toasted nut flavor, but only a small number of second year oak barrels were used.

Homemade blackberry jelly fruits are the beauty of this powerful but elegant wine. The acidity frames the fruit like an aura, giving a complete picture .","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"fr","description":"92-94 Barrel sample. Spice and ripe fruits are the main characters of this wine, which shows the results of the considerable investment that has gone into this estate. Impressive and modern in style, but still keeping its harmony.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"US","description":"Different in profile from Tensley's other two bottlings. From northern Santa Barbara County, it opens with aromas of jammy currants, grilled meat, anise, and smoke and vanilla from oak. It is rich in juicy fruit flavors, notably blackberries and cherries, and the tannins are not as tough as those in the other offerings.","province":"California"},{"country":"pt","description":"Vincent Bouchard, owner of Tedo, divides his time between the Douro and Napa Valley. This small property is located where the River Tedo joins the Douro, downriver from Pinh?o. This wine is still young, dominated by fresh black fruits, firm tannins and layers of dryness. It is certainly destined for a 15 year aging.","province":"Douro"},{"country":"US","description":"With a little bottle age, this soft wine is picking up bottle bouquet of dried violets and Kahla, in addition to the plum, blackberry and olive tapenade notes. Drinks very rich, dry and spicy, scattering an array of dusty brown allspice and Chinese spice around the mouth.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Delas has made a Vacqueyras from the 61-acre Domaine des Genets since 1990, and the alluvial soil of the estate gives deep, plummy fruit with rich tannins and a fine layer of acidity. It is not a heavyweight, but is fine and elegant.","province":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"es","description":"Broad-shouldered and bold, but like all Guelbenzu wines, it applies the brakes where necessary. Herbal, terroir-driven characteristics pop up in between the red berry, plum and oak flavors, giving it some boost and nuance. And it gets better with airing, as it delivers coffee and buttery oak at the end.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"za","description":"Tasty Sauvignon, with grass, grapefruit and slate elements in nice balance. It's crisp without being sharp, as too many are, and just slightly tangy on the tongue. An attractive wine with a spicy satisfying finish.","province":"Stellenbosch"},{"country":"es","description":"Such a pretty pink is this little Garnacha/Cabernet mix; and it tastes and smells great, too. Fruity raspberry aromas blend into the flowery bouquet, while the palate is streamlined by watermelon notes that prime the peach flavors that dominate. A mild dose of pepper on the finish is nice.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"es","description":"Clean and big, with attractive baking spice and cola aromas. Bright, deep and full of cherry and blackberry flavors, and also fairly sizable and layered. This is the type of friendly, competent wine that should please everyone, from novices up to wine snobs.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"cl","description":"Gold in color, this blend of 50% Riesling and 50% Gewrztraminer is packed with apricot, peach and honey notes along with walnut and peanut hints. It's rich and fruity, with marzipan and other sugary flavors. Modest acidity suggests it should be consumed soon.","province":"Curic Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Almost gold, with a bright yellow luster. The nose is round and full, with a clear smokiness that isn't too heavy. Quite modern in style, with rich pear and apple flavors. The '02 version is significantly less oaky than previous Alpha Chardonnays.","province":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"pt","description":"We don't see much white Port in this country, but in pt it's often served as an apritif. This is a fine example, a little sweet but also possessing bracing acidity for balance. Mouthwatering aromas and flavors run toward nuts and stone fruits, with a hint of honey.","province":"Douro"},{"country":"pt","description":"From a small parcel of old vines, this wine is dense, very firm and closed. It is in a dry style, layering richness rather than sweetness, with solid black fruit. Give this wine at least 10 years.","province":"Douro"},{"country":"US","description":"A richly fruity wine that offers up plush blackberry, cherry, bitter chocolate and herb flavors that are dry and crisp, plus a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. The tannins are kind of tough, though.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"A wine that is made from 100% Grenache, giving intense herbal aromas and concentrated, solid fruit. For a C?tes-du-Rh?ne, this is a big, powerful wine.","province":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Lately, this rather unique Riesling seems to have found its calling. It's big and chewy, and very un-German. The bouquet deals melon, honey and floral notes, which are capped by dry, minerally stone-fruit flavors that spread onto the long finish. A pleasant surprise.","province":"Maipo Valley"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:U},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:A}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function P(o,i,t,d,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return n(),r(h,null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(n(!0),r(h,null,m(a.visiblePoems,(s,y)=>(n(),w(p,{key:y,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):g("",!0)])],64)}const j=c(B,[["render",P]]);export{j as s};
