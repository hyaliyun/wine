Remove the steaks from the refrigerator, pat them dry and let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling. To make the herb brush: Starting with the basil, gather the herbs and work around the tip of an 8-inch-long metal skewer. Tie them tightly to the skewer with kitchen twine. Trim the ends of the kitchen twine so there are no long ends. Set aside until ready to grill. After the steaks have sat out for 30 minutes, brush both sides with the vegetable oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer the meat to the hot side of the grill for 4 minutes. While the steak is grilling, melt the butter in a small cast iron skillet or saucepan on the grill. Flip the steaks after 4 minutes and baste with the butter, using the herb brush. Grill the steak for an additional 4 minutes. Transfer the steaks to the indirect heat side of the grill and baste with the butter and herb brush once again, being sure to leave about 2 tablespoons of the butter in the skillet and remove from the grill. Cook the steaks, undisturbed, over indirect heat until they register 125 to 130 degrees F with an instant read thermometer for medium-rare. In the meantime, finely chop the garlic on a large wood cutting board with a juice groove. Season the garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Use the flat side of your knife to mash the garlic and salt together to create a paste. Pour the remaining butter from the skillet onto the cutting board. Use a fork to spread the mixture on the surface area of the board. Cut the kitchen twine from the herb brush and lay the herbs on top of the garlic mixture. Remove the steaks from the grill and rest them on top of the herbs and garlic mixture for 10 minutes before slicing. After 10 minutes, remove the bone from the steaks and slice against the grain. Place the meat on the herbs and serve directly from the seasoned cutting board. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 33131,&quot;Prosciutto Bundles 14 ounces (400 grams) sliced prosciutto 7 ounces (200 grams) ready-to-eat dried figs 5 1/4 ounces (150 grams) mild soft goat cheese Instructions: Cut each slice of prosciutto into 2 to 3 strips.

Cut each rack of ribs in half along the bone so they can be easily stacked. Lay them out on the parchment paper in which they were wrapped for easy cleanup. Salt and pepper liberally on both sides and pat spices into the meat. Make sure to over season the ribs, because part of the rub will inevitably come off in the pan. On a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil, stack the ribs close together, about 3 layers high. Place in the oven for 2 hours, shifting the bottom layer of ribs to the top every 30 minutes until they are tender and almost falling off the bone. One half hour before serving, transfer ribs to a preheated grill (if using coals, make sure they have burnt down to an ember). Brush ribs with Espresso Sauce and close grill. Continue to turn and brush the ribs with sauce every 10 minutes, about 3 more times. Fresh ground black pepper Mash garlic with the side of a knife and then mince finely to release oils.

Combine the pumpkin, milk, egg yolks, orange juice and zest in another bowl, mixing until homogenous. Make a well in the dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the well and mix until combined. Preheat the griddle. Beat the egg whites with a pinch salt in a separate bowl, using a whisk or electric mixer, until the whites form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the batter in thirds. Do this quickly and gently, so the pancakes will be light and fluffy. Melt small pats of butter onto the griddle, and then spread them around with a paper towel to remove any excess. Spoon or ladle the batter onto the griddle to the desired size of the pancake. When the top of the pancakes are full of holes (look like bubbles have risen to the surface and burst), flip and cook until the bottoms are golden brown. Transfer the pancakes to serving plates, dust with powdered sugar and serve with Cinnamon Maple Syrup, Vanilla Whipped Cream and Thick-Cut Bacon on the side.

Serve topped with the Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 33157,&quot;Caramel Boings 2 cups sugar 1/2 cup water Vegetable oil Bowl of ice water Instructions: Place the sugar in a saucepan. Pour the water around the edge of the pan carefully to avoid any splashing up of the water or sugar crystals onto the walls of the pan. Draw your finger through it in an \\X\\ to let the water infiltrate the sugar completely. Bring the sugar water to a boil and, without stirring, continue to cook until amber colored. Meanwhile, oil the sharpening steel very lightly with vegetable oil. Test the color of the caramel periodically by placing a drop of it on a white plate. When it?s slightly lighter than you want it to be, stop the cooking by placing the bottom of the pot in a bowl of ice water. Swirl it a bit to distribute the cooling. When the caramel has cooled enough to slowly fall from a spoon, gather up a glob (about 1 tablespoon) on the dessert spoon and hold it over the saucepan. Let it drop and, once you have a strand falling from the spoon, hold the sharpening steel over the sauce pan and wind the strand around it. Work your way up the steel, forming a spring, and when you reach the end of the steel, pinch the end of the caramel to cut it off. Let cool slightly, about 30 seconds, then slide it off the steel. Place in an airtight container with folded parchment paper in between each boing. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vin Santo, Tawny Port]&quot; 33158,&quot;Ice Cream Sandwiches 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 2 tablespoons shortening 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 (1-pint) containers ice cream (any flavor) Instructions:</p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Prepare a smoker tube with smoking pellets according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions and set on the grill to begin smoking (see Cook&#39;s Note). Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a smooth paste. Cook, stirring, until the mixture smells nutty but hasn\\u2019t browned, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the smoked paprika, then whisk in the milk and cream. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened and smooth, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the adobo and salt. Off heat, whisk in half of the shredded Cheddar and Gouda and all of the processed cheese cubes to make a smooth sauce. Spread the uncooked macaroni in a disposable 9-by-13-inch foil baking tin and pour the sauce over. Stir to coat the pasta in the sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining shredded cheese. Cover tightly with foil and place on the indirect part of the grill. Close the grill. Cook until the pasta is al dente, about 30 minutes. Remove the foil, close the grill and cook 10 minutes more. If cooking on a gas grill, turn off the grill, close the lid and let rest in the grill with the smoker tube for 10 minutes more before serving. (On a charcoal grill, just remove the baking tin and serve.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 33160,&quot;Ham Steak and Frites 3 pounds russet potatoes 1 gallon vegetable oil, for frying 24 cloves garlic<br> 3 sprigs fresh rosemary<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 onion, cut into 1/8-inch julienne strips 4 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into large dice 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme<br> 1/2 cup cider vinegar<br> 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> Salt and black pepper Six 8-ounce ham steaks 1 tablespoon black pepper 1/4 cup grape seed oil<br> Instructions: For the rosemary garlic French fries: Leaving the skin on, cut the potatoes into fries that are 1/4-inch thick and 1/4-inch wide and as long as the potato. As soon as they are cut, transfer the fries into a deep container that will hold them all and run cold water over the top. Run the water until the water overflowing out of the container runs clear. In a 2-gallon pot, heat the oil to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Strain the potatoes and pat dry. In batches, fry the french fries plus 4 to 6 garlic cloves until the fries are tender but do not have color, about 4 minutes. Transfer to the lined baking sheet and allow the oil to drain off. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. When ready to serve, heat the oil up to 350 degrees F. Fry the french fries and the garlic until the fries are golden brown and crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. With about 30 seconds left of cooking, add the rosemary sprigs. Transfer the fries and garlic to a bowl, season with salt and pepper and toss. Remove the rosemary sprigs. For the apple chutney: In a saute pan over high heat melt the butter. Add the onions and saute until caramelized and brown, about 15 minutes. Add the apples and saute until the apples are tender. Add the cinnamon and chopped thyme and saute for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and brown sugar and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the chutney until the liquid reduces by half and glazes the apples, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the ham steaks: Heat a skillet on high heat until smoking hot and reduce the heat to medium-high. Season the ham steaks with pepper. Coat the skillet with the oil. Place the ham steaks in the skillet and cook until the first side is seared. Flip the steaks and add 1 cup water to the skillet. Cover and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow them to rest. For plating: Arrange the ham steaks in the center of 6 plates. Top the steaks with 3 to 4 ounces of the apple chutney, then top with piles of the rosemary-garlic fries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 33161,&quot;Cacio e Pepe with Crispy Pancetta 4 tablespoons kosher salt 1 pound linguine<br> 8 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch dice<br> 1/2 cup cream<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons fresh ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano, plus more for garnish<br> 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for garnish<br> 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves<br> Instructions: Fill a large pasta pot with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the salt and the linguine and cook until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. While the water is coming to a boil, add the diced pancetta to a large, deep saute pan. Cook until golden brown and crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. To the same saute pan, add the cream, butter and 1 tablespoon of the black pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by a third, about 5 minutes. Stir in the Parmigiano and the Pecorino until smooth; the sauce will be a little thick. Keep warm over low heat. With tongs, remove the linguine from the pot and add it directly to the sauce; toss along with 1 cup of the pasta cooking water to thin the sauce out. Transfer to a large serving platter and garnish with more Parmigiano and Pecorino, the remaining 1 tablespoon pepper, and the parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.

Begin by grating the zest from the oranges. (If you don&#39;t have a Microplane zester, please rush out to the nearest cooking-supply store and purchase one. Thank you.) Cream the butter and granulated sugar in a bowl with a mixer. Crack in the eggs and mix until well combined, about 4 minutes. Sift the flour onto a sheet of wax paper. Add it to the bowl. Gently stir with the mixer using as few strokes as possible so the muffins aren&#39;t tough. In a small measuring cup or bowl, combine the buttermilk and baking soda. Add the buttermilk mixture to the batter and mix until just combined. Add the orange zest and mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix. Grease 36 mini-muffin cups and fill each two-thirds full with batter. I like to use a small cookie scoop to put the muffin batter in the tins. Bake for 12 to 17 minutes, until light brown. Watch to make sure they don&#39;t get too brown. Now, while the muffins are baking, prepare the glaze: Juice the 2 oranges whose zest you just stole. Add the orange juice and brown sugar to a medium bowl and stir together until just combined, but don&#39;t worry about dissolving the brown sugar completely. You want the glaze to be grainy and textured. As soon as the muffins are done, drizzle the glaze all over the top. Be sure to thoroughly coat each muffin. Don&#39;t worry if the glaze drips all over the pan; that means more for you to lick up later. Serve the muffins warm on a beautiful platter.

Turn an 8-inch square baking pan into a Battenberg pan: first, fold a long piece of foil onto itself a couple of times to a create a foil barrier to divide your pan in half, making sure that the barrier is at least the height of the pan or even a little more. Then, spray the pan and each side of the foil with cooking spray (to help the parchment stick) and line each half of the pan with two overlapping pieces of parchment paper, one going widthwise and one going lengthwise, with enough overhang to come all the way up the sides and then some. Get your scissors out and trim the parchment so that it lays nicely and doesn&#39;t curl around the corners and make you go crazy. Sorry, I know this is a lot of parchment paper (I reuse parchment all the time!). Okay, set this aside. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder, then lightly stir in the salt and set aside. In a large measuring cup, whisk together the heavy cream and sour cream and set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, cream together the butter, coconut oil and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each and periodically scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the vanilla and mix to combine. Reduce the mixer to medium-low and add the dry mixture and cream mixture in 3 alternating additions, mixing until 80 percent combined. Divide the mixture in half. In the first half, add a few drops of yellow food coloring and fold in the sprinkles as you mix until the batter is combined. Pour into one side of the pan and use a small offset spatula or a spoon to carefully spread it out evenly. In the second half of the batter, add a few drops of red food coloring and fold it in as you mix until the batter is combined. Pour into the other side of the pan and use a small offset spatula or a spoon to carefully spread it out evenly. Bake until the tops of the cakes are browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs on it; begin checking for doneness at 45 minutes. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then use the parchment wings to lift them out of the pans and onto a wire rack to cool completely. Level the cakes and trim off the sides if they&#39;re uneven. Halve each cake crosswise to yield 4 equal rectangles that are as wide as they are thick (measure the thickness of the cake once it&#39;s leveled, then turn your ruler 90 degrees to measure that same amount on top of the cake and score with an accordion pastry cutter). Enjoy a bite of cake scraps and set these aside. To assemble: Knead the marzipan with the blue food coloring to get your desired color, dusting with powdered sugar if it gets too sticky. On a silicone mat (or a big piece of parchment or a counter dusted with powdered sugar, but I strongly recommend a silicone mat so that you don&#39;t get powdered sugar all over what will eventually become the outside surface of the marzipan), roll the marzipan out into a rectangle that&#39;s about 7 1/2 inches wide by 13 inches long, dusting the top with powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking, and rolling in a scattering of sprinkles at the end. Trim the edges so they&#39;re straight. Brush all over with a thin layer of jam and place a rectangle of pink cake at one end. Brush the exposed surfaces with a thin layer of jam. Squish a rectangle of sprinkle cake right next to it and brush the exposed surfaces with a layer of jam. Stack the other two rectangles of cake on top, brushing with jam, to form a checkerboard pattern. Carefully roll it onto its side, pressing the marzipan all over so that it sticks, then continue to roll until the cake is covered. Trim off any excess marzipan, then decorate with additional marzipan decorations as desired. Wrap in firmly plastic wrap and let set in the fridge for a couple of hours.

Rub the outsides of the peppers with vegetable oil and place them, stem side down, onto a baking sheet. Bake them for 30 minutes, or until the skins are wrinkled and slightly charred. Remove the peppers from the oven and put them into a large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let them steam until they are cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Peel the skin from the peppers, making sure to keep them whole, and set aside. While the peppers are baking and steaming, make the pesto: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Have a bowl of ice water ready. When the water is boiling, add the basil leaves. After 5 seconds (yes, 5 seconds) remove the basil and immediately put it into the ice water. (This will keep the pesto green.) When it is cold, drain the basil and squeeze out any excess water. Put the basil into a food processor or blender and add the pine nuts, cheese, and garlic. Turn on the processor and slowly add the olive oil until the mixture is smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. In a large skillet over high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Cook the eggplant until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and cook until softened and lightly browned, about 10 minutes more. Transfer them to a cutting board, let them cool a bit, and chop them finely with a knife. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the same pan over medium-high heat. When it is melted, add the Swiss chard, cover the pan, and let the chard wilt for about 1 minute. Transfer the chard to a bowl. Add the vegetables, ricotta, 1 tablespoon of the pesto, and season with salt and pepper. Mix well, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Stuff this mixture into the peppers, being careful to keep them whole. Place them on their sides into a lightly buttered baking dish. Sprinkle each pepper evenly with bread crumbs and bake until the tops are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately garnished with extra pesto. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 33178,&quot;Grilled Flatbread with Wild Mushrooms 1 teaspoon granulated sugar One packet (2 1/2-teaspoons) instant yeast<br> 4 cups plus 3 tablespoons (18 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for oiling the bowl<br> 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter 1 pound (about 4 cups) baby portobello, cremini or baby bella mushrooms, sliced 1 pound oyster or white button mushrooms, coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)<br> 6 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 dried bay leaf, broken in half<br> Kosher salt<br> All-purpose flour, for dusting Olive oil, for brushing<br> 1 cup (4 ounces) shredded truffled Pecorino, preferably Boschetto<br> 1/2 cup (about 2 ounces) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Chopped fresh chives, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the dough: Stir together the sugar in 2 cups warm water in a medium bowl until dissolved. Sprinkle the yeast over the water, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let sit until the mixture becomes slightly foamy, about 5 minutes. If the mixture doesn&#39;t become foamy, it means the yeast is dead; throw the mixture out and start over with a new packet of yeast. Add the flour and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix on low speed until combined. Add the yeast mixture and the olive oil and knead on low speed for 4 minutes. Raise the mixer speed to medium-low and knead until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, about 6 minutes. Raise the mixer speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth, pliable, and elastic, 5 minutes more. Lightly oil a large, clean bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the mushrooms: Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add half of the portobello mushrooms, half of the oyster mushrooms, 3 sprigs thyme and half of the bay leaf to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms no longer give off liquid and are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add a pinch of salt, stir and transfer the mushrooms to a large bowl. Return the pan to the stovetop over medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. When it has melted, add the remaining mushrooms, thyme and bay leaf. Cook the second batch in the same manner as above. Add a pinch of salt, stir and transfer the mushrooms to the bowl with the first batch. Set aside. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. If you&#39;d like to grill your crust first, preheat a grill for cooking over medium heat. Dust your work surface with flour and cut the dough in half. Using your fingertips, press out each piece into an oval roughly 12 inches long and 4 inches wide. If grilling crust first, brush the dough with olive oil and place on the grill. Grill until cooked through and well-marked on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from the heat and transfer the flatbreads to the prepared pans. If not grilling, simply transfer one piece of dough to each of the prepared pans and brush with olive oil. Divide the mushrooms evenly between the two crusts and top with the truffled Pecorino and the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Bake until the cheese has melted and the flatbreads are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes if the crusts were grilled and 17 to 20 minutes if not (if your oven can&#39;t accommodate both flatbreads on the center rack, use the upper and lower racks and rotate and switch their positions halfway through). Garnish with chives and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 33179,&quot;Pumpkin Parmigiana 5 pounds ripe plum tomatoes Kosher salt 4 cloves garlic 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Pinch cl flakes 1/4 bunch fresh basil 1 medium sugar pumpkin (about 2 1/2 pounds) 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/3 cups freshly grated Parmesan 15 fresh basil leaves, torn Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the pomodoro sauce: Bring a pot of water to a boil; prepare an ice water bath. In 2 batches, blanch the tomatoes in the boiling water for about 1 minute, then shock in the ice water. Remove and discard the skins. Seed the tomatoes. Strain the seeds from the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer; reserve the liquid and discard the seeds. Put the peeled tomatoes, tomato liquid and a large pinch of salt in a large bowl. Mix the salt into the tomatoes and set aside. Put the garlic in a saucepan and cover with the olive oil. Cook over very low heat until the garlic is golden and soft, about 15 minutes. Strain and reserve the oil. Add the infused garlic oil and cl flakes to a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot. Turn the heat to low and slowly bloom the cl flakes, about 2 minutes. Add the salted tomatoes and liquid to the stockpot and increase the heat to medium high. Bring to a slight boil and skim any foam that rises to the top. Lower the heat to a simmer. Smash the tomatoes with a potato masher. Cook until reduced by one-fourth, 25 to 30 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with salt. Remove from the heat and submerge the basil in the sauce to infuse it as it cools down. Set aside 2 cups of the sauce for the parmigiana; reserve the remaining 4 to 5 cups sauce for another use. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for 3 months. For the pumpkin parmigiana: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Peel the pumpkin, cut it in half and scoop out the seeds. Place it cut-side down on a cutting board and slice it crosswise into half-moons approximately 1/4 inch thick.<br> Coat the bottom of a glass or ceramic deep-dish pie plate with 1/2 cup pomodoro sauce and arrange one-third of the pumpkin pieces in a single layer on top of it. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmesan and scatter one-third of the basil leaves over the top. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon 1/2 cup sauce to cover this layer, then repeat two more times, layering the pumpkin pieces, oil, Parmesan, basil, salt and pepper and sauce until just below the lip of the pie plate. Scatter the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan on top.<br> Cover the dish with foil and bake until barely tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until browned on top and most of the liquid around the sides has evaporated, an additional 30 minutes. Let sit for 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 33180,&quot;Candied Orange 6 thick-skinned Valencia or navel oranges 4 1/2 cups sugar, plus extra for rolling 1 1/2 cups water Instructions: Cut tops and bottoms off of the orange and score the orange into quarters, cutting down only into the peel and not into the fruit. Peel the skin and pith of the orange in large pieces, use the orange for another recipe. Cut the peel into strips about 1/4-inch wide. Put the orange peel in a large saucepan with cold water to cover, bring to a boil over high heat. Then pour off the water. Repeat 1 or 2 more times depending up how assertive you want the orange peels to be. (Test kitchen liked the texture of a 3 time blanch best, it also mellowed the bitterness. But it is a matter of preference.) Remove the orange peels from the pan. Whisk the sugar with 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 8 to 9 minutes (If you took the sugar&#39;s temperature with a candy thermometer it would be at the soft thread stage, 230 to 234 degrees F.) Add the peels and simmer gently, reducing heat to retain a simmer. Cook until the peels get translucent, about 45 minutes. Resist the urge to stir the peels or you may introduce sugar crystals into the syrup. If necessary, swirl the pan to move the peels around. Drain the peels, (save the syrup for ice tea.) Roll the peels in sugar and dry on a rack, for 4 to 5 hours. Return to the sugar to store. Cook&#39;s Note: One way to use orange peels is to stuff a dried date with a piece of orange peel and almond, then dip the entire thing into dark chocolate. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 33181,&quot;Steak with Avocado Sauce and Tomato Salad 1 1/4 pounds beef eye round roast (in 1 piece) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon Mexican-style chili powder Kosher salt 1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved 7 to 8 canned hearts of palm, thickly sliced 2 tablespoons lime juice, plus lime wedges for garnish Freshly ground pepper 1 ripe Hass avocado 1/3 cup fresh cilantro 1 large clove garlic Flour tortillas, warmed, for serving (optional) Instructions: Slice the roast crosswise into 3 even steaks.

Add the butter and cut it in with a pastry blender until the largest pieces are the size of small peas and the mixture begins to clump on the pastry blender. Shuffle through the mixture with your hands, pinching chunks of fat to flatten them. Stir the vinegar and 5 tablespoons ice water together in a bowl. Add the liquid to the flour mixture and stir with a fork. Pinch a clump of dough in your hands: If it feels moist and clumps together easily, it&#39;s probably hydrated enough. If it feels really crumbly, add another tablespoon or two of ice water until you can form a baseball-size clump of dough, packing it on as if you were making a snowball. Divide the dough in half and form each half into a flat disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Thirty minutes before you&#39;re ready to roll out the dough, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature to soften. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the blueberry filling: In a bowl, toss the blueberries with the sugar, cornstarch and lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Dust a worktop and rolling pin with flour. Roll out one dough disk a little less than 1?4 inch thick, about 14 inches in diameter. Fold the dough in half and transfer it to a 9- or 10-inch pie plate. Unfold. Press the dough into the corners, leaving the overhang for now. Refrigerate the first crust while you roll out the second disk of dough. Remove the bottom crust from the refrigerator and fill it with the berry mixture. Tuck the pats of cold butter beneath the top layer of berries. Top with the second piece of dough, and trim both to a 1/2-inch overhang around the pie. Tuck the overhang into a roll and crimp the edge, pressing down to hook some of the dough over the edge of the dish, holding the pie. Cut a hole in the center of the pie, as well as some decorative vents. Brush the top of the pie with cream and dust it with sugar. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for another 20 minutes. Cover the edges of the pie with foil and continue to bake until the center juices bubble and thicken, 25 to 35 minutes more. Let the pie cool until it is just warm to the touch before slicing and serving.

In either case, drain them, then refill the saucepan halfway with water and cook the wheat berries, partially covered, for 1 hour. When done, the wheat berries will be tender but slightly crunchy. Drain them thoroughly and let them cool. Bring 2 cups of water, the canola oil, and salt to a boil in a mediumsize saucepan. Stir in the lentils and rice and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and cook for 17 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Do not stir the mixture at all while it is cooking. Carefully spoon the mixture into a large bowl and let cool to room temperature. Meanwhile combine the dressing ingredients in a jar with a tightfitting lid and shake vigorously. Set aside. When the rice mixture is completely cooled, use a large spoon to break up any clumps that have formed. Carefully stir in the wheat berries, carrot, red pepper, and parsley. Pour the dressing on the salad and toss. Let marinate at least 20 minutes before serving. (Note The rice greedily soaks up the dressing, so if you want to make this salad 2 to 24 hours in advance, pour on only half the dressing at first, then add the remainder about 20 minutes before serving.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 33197,&quot;Big-Batch Swedish Meatballs 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon minced onions 2/3 cup fresh bread crumbs 1 cup water 3/4 pound lean ground beef 3/4 pound lean ground pork 2 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 4 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups beef stock Instructions: In a small, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add the onions and saute, stirring often until soft, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the bread crumbs and water.

Depending on how well you space your drawing for the entire centerpiece, you will need 4 to 5 set ups of parchment paper lined sheet pans. Starting with the centerpiece layers, draw 3 round bases of gradual size: draw the first circle 8 inches in diameter, the second circle about 5 inches in diameter and the third circle about 3 inches in diameter. Fill each circle by drawing a crosshatch pattern spacing your lines 1/2 to 3/4-inch apart. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Place the pate a choux in a piping bag with a 1/4-inch straight tip and trace the base shapes you drew. To make the supports for the base: Using the same technique used to trace the 3 round bases, draw 5 curled lines that resemble a decorative letter S about 6 inches tall. These will sit between the largest and middle-sized base. Then make the same shape in a smaller size, about 3 inches tall, you will need 3 of the smaller S shapes. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Trace the S shapes with the piping bag filled with the pate a choux. To make the butterflies: begin by making the butterfly wings, draw the shape of a teardrop about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long. Draw a second tear drop, the same size as the first, they should be connected, round end to round end in order to create a wing shape. Draw 10 sets of wings, this will give you 5 butterflies. Place more pate a choux in a paper cornet (see How to Make a Cornet). Trim the tip so you can draw a very fine line. Trace the outline of the butterfly wings with the pate a choux. Then, in a freeform style, draw a narrower teardrop shape within the boundaries of each of the larger teardrops. Make sure the smaller teardrops connect with the larger teardrops at both ends. To make the body of the butterfly, using the same cornet, pipe 2-inch strips making a thick end (the head) and gradually tapering off. To make the antennae simply pipe a 1 1/2-inch V shape. You will need 5 sets of bodies and 5 sets of antennae. Bake the pate a choux in the oven at 320 degrees F for about 20 minutes. How to Make a Cornet: The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations. Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between 2 fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. Prepare the pate a choux: Place the water, salt, granulated sugar, and butter in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, set it over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the bread flour all at once and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, push the paste from side to side with the wooden spoon. Turn it onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, which helps it dry. Keep the paste moving, or it will burn. The paste will dry out and leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer set on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs 1 at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth again. The number of eggs used will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 2 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about 1foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in 1 big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated. To make the caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until light golden brown. Pour the caramel into a heatproof bowl to hold the temperature of the sugar. Put a towel under the bowl to keep it from tipping and to protect your hands from the heat of the glass. Assemble the centerpiece: The caramel acts as glue. Dip the bottom of the first large S into the caramel and stick it to the largest base going from the out side rim of the circle, towards the center of the circle. In other words, the base supports should almost meet each other in the center of the circle. This creates a structure for the next layer to rest on. You will have to hold each S support in place in order for the caramel to harden and actually stick, keeping the S shape in the right position. Repeat using the other 4 pieces, spacing them evenly. Dip the bottom of the first small S into the caramel and stick it to the medium-sized base. Repeat using the other pieces, again spacing them evenly. Place the medium size base on the large S supports. Top the small S supports with the smallest base. You will have a 3 tiered structure. To assemble the butterflies: using the caramel as glue, connect 2 sets of the wings together. Do this along length of the wings. Adjust the wings to sit at a slight angle, as though the wings are in mid-flight. Do this with all 10 wing sets, creating 5 total butterflies. Using a paring knife dipped in the caramel to spread it might be easier than dipping the wings or bodies in the bowl of caramel. You may need to prop the wings up while they harden. You can do so using 2 rolling pins or 2 thick books lying with about 2 inches between them. The space between them is where the glued center juncture will rest on the work surface and you will be able let the wings harden on a slight angle; this way you will not have to hold them in place until they harden. Using more caramel, glue the bodies to the area where you glued the wings together. Place the fatter end of the body at the top section where the wings are joined. Glue the antenna to the fatter part of the bodies. If at some point during the gluing process the caramel has become to stiff to use; place the caramel in the microwave oven at 30-second intervals, until it loosens up for you to use it again. Once the butterflies have been assembled and the caramel has hardened, you can then glue them wherever you like on the 3-tiered centerpiece. Place the centerpiece on a large tray. Display the Bomboloni and the Cloud Puffs around the centerpiece.

Season the ducks generously, putting some salt in the cavity as well. Make sure you save the fat and the giblets for the gravy. Coarsely grate half the ginger and rhubarb. Mix this in a bowl with half the sage and all the garlic and onion, and stuff the mixture inside the cavity of the ducks, ensuring there is an air cavity. Place the ducks on a tray on top of the chopped up giblets and roast in the oven for one hour. Turn the temperature down to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and cook for another 1 1/2 hours until crisp and tender. The ducks are ready when the skin is crisp and the leg bones can be easily removed. During this time you will need to drain the fat maybe 3 times into a bowl, this will separate into a clear fat which you can keep for roasting. Once cooked allow the ducks to rest on a warmed plate while you make the sauce. Drain off any remaining fat from the roasting tray. Pull out all the stuffing and any juices from the inside of the duck and put in the roasting tray and warm this on a low heat. Add the Marsala and loosen all the sticky goodness from the bottom of the tray, and reduce. Add the stock and reduce to a good taste and consistency. Pass the sauce trough a coarse sieve. Remove the breasts from the ducks with a knife and, using your hands, remove the thighs. Arrange the breasts and thighs on a large serving plate. Finely slice the remaining ginger and fry off in a little hot oil (or you can use the duck fat) in a non-stick pan. As the ginger begins to color, add the rest of the rhubarb, finely sliced, and the rest of the sage. Fry until crisp. Sprinkle this over the duck and drizzle with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 33207,&quot;Slow-Cooker Chicken Wings 3 pounds chicken wings, split Kosher salt 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons oyster sauce 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 1/4 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder 2 scallions, thinly sliced on a bias, for serving Instructions: Put the chicken wings in a 6-quart slow cooker and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt.

Transfer to a small plate and cool. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Put the oil and Canadian bacon in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook, stirring once or twice, until the bacon is golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Transfer the bacon to the baking sheet to cool slightly. Scoop the egg yolks into a medium bowl and mash lightly with a fork. Add the bacon, mayonnaise, mustard, hot sauce and green onion and stir to combine. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of the filling into each egg white half and sprinkle with some of the toasted breadcrumbs. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33214,&quot;White Chocolate Mousse 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 5 ounces white chocolate, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup egg whites (from about 4 eggs) 2 tablespoons sugar Chocolate Bag, recipe follows 8 ounces semisweet chocolate Mixed berries Mint sprigs Instructions: Two days before you plan to serve the dessert, in a small saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat just until it boils. Immediately turn off the heat. Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Strain into another bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove the mixture from the refrigerator and, using a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or a hand mixer, whip it into fluffy, soft peaks. Return to the refrigerator. In a clean dry bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form, then add the sugar and continue whipping until glossy and stiff, about 30 seconds more. Fold into the white chocolate mixture, and then spoon the mixture (or pipe through a pastry bag) into glasses or chocolate bags. Melt chocolate over hot water. Using a thin small clear 4-sided cellophane bag cut the top off to desired height. Un-crease the bag so it stands up and open. Using a paintbrush, coat the inside of the bag well with chocolate. Put in the freezer to set up until very hard, about 30 minutes. Cut the bag a little and pull it away from the chocolate. Store chilled until ready to serve. To serve, fill it with white chocolate mousse then lay it on a plate on its side so it looks like it&#39;s spilling over. Garnish it with a cascade of mixed berries and a mint sprig. You can fill it with truffles, too. Notes about the recipe: Ganache is a word that we&#39;ve been seeing on more and more dessert menus. It has a rich, fancy, very French sound, but ganache is essentially just a combination of chocolate and water or cream. Depending on the proportions, the mixture can be used in a variety of ways: as a glaze, a filling, or a candy center, to name just the ways we use it in this book. With enough cream added, it becomes whip-able, and that&#39;s the foundation of this white-chocolate mousse. White chocolate is devastatingly popular, but it&#39;s also not exactly chocolate. It&#39;s mostly cocoa butter, extracted from cocoa beans and enhanced with sugar and vanilla. White chocolate is not the same thing as the \\confectionery coating\\ or \\white coating\\ you see in the market; real white chocolate contains cocoa butter. Note that you&#39;ll need two days for making this dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 33215,&quot;Mount Saint Melon 3 limes 4 cups cubed watermelon, plus wedges for serving 1 cup prosecco 1/4 cup Campari 1 cup peach nectar 3/4 cup sugar Instructions: Remove wide strips of zest from one of the limes, using a vegetable peeler. Combine with the sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Turn off the heat and let cool to room temperature. Discard the strips of zest. Finely grate the zest from the remaining 2 limes and set aside. Juice all 3 limes and blend the juice, watermelon, prosecco, Campari and sugar syrup in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish and freeze, 2 hours. Use a fork to scrape the ice crystals toward the center of the pan, then continue freezing, scraping every 45 minutes, until the mixture is no longer slushy, about 4 more hours. Scoop into paper cones or cups. Drizzle with the peach nectar and sprinkle with the grated lime zest. Garnish with watermelon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 33216,&quot;Poulet Saute Chasseur 2 (11/2 pound) chickens, quartered 1 1/2 ounces clarified butter for browning Salt and pepper to taste 10 1/2 cups brown veal stock or brown chicken stock, enriched with browned trimmings 3 ounces carrots, medium chop 3 ounces onions, medium chop 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 Bouquet Garni (thyme, parsley stems, peppercorns, bay leaf, all wrapped in cheesecloth) 9 ounces sliced mushrooms 1 shallot, small dice 2 ounces cognac 2 ounces white wine 20 ounces enriched stock 1 tablespoon tomato concasse 3 ounces unsalted butter Salt and pepper to taste 1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon 1 tablespoon finely chopped chervil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Quarter the chickens. Be careful to leave the breasts covered with skin. Be sure the oyster is left attached to the leg. Remove the thighbone and carefully cut off the drumsticks. Reserve until needed. In a large heavy bottomed stock pot, brown the bones and trimmings from the chickens with the chopped carrots and onions. Pour off the excess fat and moisten with the chicken or veal stock. Add the tomato paste and the bouquet garni. This produces an enriched stock for the sauce. Cook at a low simmer for 40 to 45 minutes, then strain and skim off any excess fat. Next gather all ingredients for the sauce, and measure out the wine and cognac. To assemble the dish, season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large saute pan heat clarified butter and brown the chicken skin side down. When the chicken is browned, remove it from the pan and into a 375 degree oven. Remove excess fat from the pan, return the pan to the heat and saute the mushroom slices. After 2 minutes add the chopped shallots and saute for a couple of minutes longer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the Cognac. Return the pan to the heat and ignite the Cognac. When the flames have died down add the white wine. Reduce by half. Strain the reinforced stock and skim off any fat that has floated to the top. Add the stock to the mushroom mixture and continue reducing. Add the tomato concasse. When the sauce begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, swirl in the butter. Once the butter is incorporated and the chopped chervil and tarragon to taste. To assemble the dish, remove the chicken pieces from the oven. Remove the breastbone from the chicken breast. The advantage to removing the breastbone after cooking is that it helps the breast keep its shape and remain moist during cooking. Since breast tend to cook more quickly than thighs, removing the thighbone and leaving the breastbone intact during cooking ensures that the two are done at the same time. Place 1 piece of white meat and 1 piece of dark on a clean plate and cover with the sauce. Garnish with chopped chervil and tarragon and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 33217,&quot;Tahini Banana Bread Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons tahini 4 very ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 cup) 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon black sesame seeds 1 teaspoon white sesame seeds 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Use a vegetable peeler to remove the woody outermost layer of the stem. Use a spoon to remove the inedible hairy leaves and slice into quarters. Place the artichokes in a bowl of water with some lemon juice to keep the artichoke from oxidizing or turning brown. Add the flour to a casserole dish and whisk in some salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a high-sided skillet or Dutch oven. Dredge the artichokes in the flour, shaking off the excess. Once the oil is hot, slip the artichokes in the hot oil and fry for about 4 to 5 minutes, using tongs to flip them from time to time. Transfer the artichokes and let drain on a paper towel-lined platter and sprinkle with salt. Serve with Fish Tacos. For the pico de gallo: Mix together the tomatoes, capers, olive oil, lemon juice, cilantro and onions in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. For the radishes: Slice the radishes in half lengthwise, then into thin half-moons (and a few into quarter moons, if you want, for varied texture). Toss the radishes together with the anchovies, parsley and olive oil in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.<br> For the fish tacos: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, semolina flour, baking powder, sea salt and some pepper in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the beer and set aside.<br> Add enough canola oil to a large cast-iron or other low-sided skillet to come halfway up the sides. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F. (Use a deep fry thermometer to be sure - or do it the grandma way and add a piece of bread to see if it fries and browns - if it does, it&#39;s ready).<br> Slice the tilapia into 1/2-inch strips or \\finger-size pieces.<br> When the oil is hot, dip each piece of tilapia into the batter using tongs, allowing excess to drip off. Carefully add to the hot oil one piece at a time. Fry in batches until golden brown and the fish is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spider or skimmer and drain on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet.<br> Meanwhile, warm the tortillas by wrapping them in foil and placing them in the oven for 10 minutes. To serve, place one piece of fish on a warmed tortilla. Top with shredded lettuce and an avocado slice.

Open the crab meat, dump into a clean dish, and with scrupulously clean hands, pick through and clean the crabmeat of all shell fragments. Be careful of the delicate nature of such a high quality product and try not to crumble the large lumps of crab. Mix the crabmeat with the sweet peppers, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro leaves, and mayonnaise. Add the seasoning powder, 4 tablespoons of the bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well then refrigerate the mixture for twenty minutes. A cold mix is easier to work with and form into cakes. Cover a work surface with waxed paper and sprinkle with half of the remaining bread crumbs. Scoop up and divide the crabmeat into 6 equalsize portions and place each mound on the work space. With the a portion of crab in the palm of one hand pat the crab with the fingers of your other hand into a diskshaped cake approximately 3/4-inch thick. It is important for the crab cakes to be the same thickness so that they will cook uniformly. Pat each cake with the bread crumbs, turning them so they coat evenly on all sides. Refrigerate for at least an hour so that the firm enough to cook and in this way prevent them from crumbling. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Not more than half an hour before you plan to serve the crab cakes add enough oil to cover the bottom of a saute pan. Heat until just before it begins to smoke. Add the crab cakes gently, being careful not to crowd the pan. (Cook them in two batches if necessary.) Turn the cakes and brown the second side. When the crab cakes are well browned to a rich golden on both sides, place on a heat proof platter and into a 375 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes to ensure that they are fully cooked and hot at the center. Serve with chili mayonnaise and a mango salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 33224,&quot;Sausage-and-Biscuit Pigs in Blankets Twelve 4-inch links breakfast sausage 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon baking soda Kosher salt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, frozen in 1 piece 2 tablespoons finely chopped scallion greens 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper Maple syrup, for serving Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, set a baking sheet on it and preheat to 400 degrees F. Toss the sausage links with the oil in a large bowl. Add the sausages to the hot baking sheet, and spread out in 1 layer. Roast, turning halfway through, until lightly browned in spots and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely. Cut each sausage in half crosswise. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter on the large holes of a box grater, and add to the bowl, along with the scallions. Add the buttermilk, and mix together gently with a fork. When a shaggy dough forms, turn it out onto a floured surface. Working quickly, roll the dough out into a 14-by-8-inch rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Trim each side by about an inch, to yield a 12-by-6-inch rectangle with clean edges. Cut twelve 1-inch-wide strips, then cut those strips in half crosswise. (You should have 24 strips, each about 1 inch by 3 inches.) Wrap a biscuit strip around the belly of each sausage half, and place, seam-side down, at least 1 inch apart on a clean baking sheet. Sprinkle a small pinch of cracked black pepper on top of each one. (Refrigerate up to overnight if not baking right away.) Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.

Fill a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven with 3 inches of oil, and attach a deep-fry thermometer to the side. Heat the pot over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F. Fry the spring rolls in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Serve with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 33254,&quot;Cocoa Pork 5 to 6-pound boneless pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons kosher salt 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1 tablespoon grated orange zest 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground clove 3 medium yellow onions, quartered 1/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1/4 cup red wine vinegar Instructions: In a small mixing bowl, add the cocoa, sugar, orange zest, black pepper, and clove. Combine well to form a rub. Coat the pork with oil and sprinkle with the salt. Smear the cocoa rub all over the pork shoulder. Add the onion quarters and pork to a large dish and pour orange juice and red wine vinegar over the pork. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 12 hours to marinate. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle. Let pork sit a room temperature while oven heats up, at least 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove pork from marinade and dry well. Put the pork in a clean, dry roasting pan, and roast until the skin is browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven to 325 degrees F, scatter onions from the marinade around the pork and roast until the internal temperature registers 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 to 2 1/2 to 2 hours. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and cover loosely with foil. Allow the roast to rest for 15 to 30 minutes before carving. Slice between the meat and cracklings and lift the crackling off in 1 piece. Cut the crackling into pieces, so they&#39;re easier to eat. Carve meat downward and against the grain and arrange on a platter. Spoon pan juices and onions over the meat and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 33255,&quot;Triple Chocolate Boston Cream Pie 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 cups sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup warm coffee 1 1/2 ounces chopped bittersweet chocolate 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch Pinch kosher salt 2 large egg yolks 1 cup whole milk 1 tablespoon Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/3 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate 1/4 cup heavy cream Pinch kosher salt Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-by-2-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, melted butter and eggs. Alternate whisking the flour mixture and the buttermilk and coffee into the sugar and egg mixture, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool for 20 minutes, then flip the cake out onto the rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. For the custard: Put the chocolate and butter in a medium bowl and set a fine-mesh sieve over it. In another medium bowl, whisk the sugar, cornstarch, salt and egg yolks together until smooth. Bring the milk and the cocoa powder to a simmer in a small pot. While whisking, add about 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture to the yolk mixture. Repeat this process until the two are completely combined. Return the mixture to the pot and heat over medium while stirring constantly. Bring the custard to a boil and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately pour the custard through the sieve into the bowl with the chocolate. After the butter and chocolate have melted, whisk until smooth. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap, making sure the plastic touches the surface of the custard, and chill until completely cold, about 1 hour. For the glaze: Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan and pour it over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand until smooth and then whisk it to combine. Whisk in the salt. Chill the glaze, stirring occasionally, until it is thick enough to spread over the top of the cake, 20 to 30 minutes. To assemble the cake, cut it in half crosswise. Spread the chocolate custard evenly over the bottom half, and replace the top half. Spread the glaze evenly over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 33256,&quot;Dos Leches Strawberry Cake 2 cups heavy whipping cream, chilled 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar<br> Zest of 2 limes, plus zest of 1 lime for garnish<br> 2 frozen prepared pound cakes One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> 2 pounds strawberries, 8 sliced and reserved for garnish, remaining cut into small dice<br> Instructions: Whip the cream in a bowl using a whisk or hand mixer.

Add approximately 2 cups of the flour along with the yeast and salt; whisk until moistened and combined. Remove the whisk attachment and replace with a dough hook. Add all but 3/4 cup of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. Check the consistency of the dough, add more flour if necessary; the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead by hand about 30 seconds. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough, cover and let double in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Mix until well incorporated. Set aside until ready to use. Butter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently shape the dough into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Roll into an 18 by 12-inch rectangle. Brush the dough with the 3/4-ounce of melted butter, leaving 1/2-inch border along the top edge. Sprinkle the filling mixture over the dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border along the top edge; gently press the filling into the dough. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness. Using a serrated knife, slice the cylinder into 1 1/2-inch rolls; yielding 12 rolls. Arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight or up to 16 hours. Remove the rolls from the refrigerator and place in an oven that is turned off. Fill a shallow pan 2/3-full of boiling water and set on the rack below the rolls. Close the oven door and let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy; approximately 30 minutes. Remove the rolls and the shallow pan of water from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the oven is ready, place the rolls on the middle rack and bake until golden brown, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, approximately 30 minutes. While the rolls are cooling slightly, make the icing by whisking the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. Spread over the rolls and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 33322,&quot;Manila Clam and White Bean Ragout with Parsley Sauce 1 (7 ounce) grouper fillet, skinless Kosher salt Fresh ground black pepper 1- ounce olive oil 1-ounce olive oil 1 teaspoon shallots, chopped 1/2 teaspoon garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon roasted red peppers, finely diced and Sauteed 1/2 cup navy beans, fully cooked 1/2 cup white wine 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 7 Manila clams 1 teaspoon Italian parsley, chopped Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 bunch Italian parsley leaves 6 ounces olive oil Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Season grouper with salt and pepper.

Place ribs in a roasting pan and sprinkle with salt. Bake for approximately 25 minutes. After the ribs are golden brown, remove from the oven and baste with pure maple syrup. Lower the oven temperature to 250 degrees F. Tightly wrap the ribs with a foil tent, making sure not to put any holes in the foil in order to maintain moisture and flavor. Return to the oven for approximately 10 hours. When you open the foil to check the ribs (carefully avoiding the steam), you should be able to place a fork into the meat and it should immediately break off the bone. If there is any resistance or hardness, continue cooking in the oven for up to 2 hours longer. After cooking is complete, coat with another layer of maple syrup. If not serving immediately, wrap in plastic to keep moist until ready to use. To serve, cut each rack in half.

Divide the okra evenly among the 4 jars, standing them up vertically, alternating stems up and down. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the salt, vinegar and water to a boil. Once boiling, pour this mixture over the okra in the jars, leaving space between the top of the liquid and the lid. Seal the lids. Set in a cool dry place for 2 weeks. *Tips on Sterilizing Jars Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years. Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods. Sterilizing Tips: Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed. To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes. Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes. As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands. After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 33336,&quot;Holiday Pie-Spiced Walnuts with Cherries 6 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg Kosher salt Vegetable oil, for oiling the baking sheet 1 large egg white 4 cups unsalted raw walnuts 1 cup dried cherries Instructions: Mix together the sugar, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a small bowl and set aside.

Add butter and either pulse a few times or work the butter gradually into the flour mixture with your fingers until the pieces are the size of walnuts. Add egg, pulse a few more times or mix into the mixture until the mixture holds together when you squeeze it with your finger. Add the water if necessary to reach the proper consistency. Turn the dough out onto a board and form it into a round disk. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. After the dough has chilled, remove from refrigerator and roll it a little larger than a 9-inch pie pan and about 1/8-inch thick. Place the dough in the pan. Trim the edges with a knife. Refrigerate again for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Dock the dough with a fork. Line the dough in the pan with aluminum foil, fill with dried rice or beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights. Bake 10-15 minutes more until the crust it lightly browned. Cool to room temperature. To make the filling: In a saucepan, add 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, lemon juice, lemon zest and bring to boil. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and cornstarch. In another bowl mix the egg yolks and 1/2 cup water together and add to the cornstarch mixture. When the lemon juice boils add a little of it into the yolks whisking. Then add the egg mixture back into the saucepan and over medium heat whisk constantly until the mixture thickens. Remove pan from heat. Add butter, stir until melted and incorporated. Pour immediately into pre-baked crust. Cool to room temperature. To make Meringue topping: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In the bowl of an electric mixer beat the egg whites until they begin to foam. Reduce the speed of the mixer. Gradually add the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until it dissolves into the egg whites. You should feel no grit. It should take about 3 minutes. Then increase the speed and beat until medium stiff peaks. Dollop the meringue on top of the pie, beginning at the crust. Swirl with the back of a teaspoon to make peaks. Or, pipe a lattice design across the top. Sift a little confectioners sugar over the top. Bake for 20 minutes (checking and turning the pan every 5 minutes) until the crust is golden all over.

Stir in drops of red and ivory food coloring for the \\tomato sauce.\\ Add the remaining buttercream to a third bowl and tint ivory for the crumb coat (the first layer of frosting on the cake), \\filling\\ and \\crust.<br> To assemble the cake: Lightly coat the cake with cooking spray, then cover with parchment and invert onto a cutting board.<br> Cut cake into triangles: With the cake oriented vertically (one of the short sides nearest you) run a sharp paring knife from one of the corners nearest you to the center of the far short edge of the cake. Do the same from the other near corner to divide the cake into one large triangle and two smaller adjoining triangles. With a large offset spatula, carefully lift the large triangle onto a cake board. Coat the top and sides with a thin layer of ivory buttercream. Flip the two smaller triangles, side-by-side with the cut-sides facing out, onto the larger triangle to form a second cake layer.<br> Using a serrated knife, trim 1 1/2-inches from the short side (the \\crust\\ end) of the cake, angling the knife to reproduce the curve of a pizza pan. Gather up the cake scraps and squeeze them into a dough. Roll the dough into a rough 1-inch log and press it into crust end of the cake to form the raised lip of the pizza crust. Using an offset spatula, spread a thin crumb coat layer of ivory buttercream all over the cake. Chill until firm, about 20 minutes.<br> Generously frost the sides and crust with more ivory buttercream. Pipe a small mound of buttercream onto the crust to look like a dough bubble. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes. Dilute 2 drops ivory food coloring with the alcohol spirits. Dip a pastry brush in the mixture and using a light hand, brush the crust and sides of the cake light brown.<br> Microwave the red buttercream in 15 second intervals, stirring in between, until slightly melted. Transfer to a pastry bag without a tip and pipe an irregular \\sauce\\ along the base of the crust and slightly up the lip.<br> Set aside a quarter of the yellow buttercream. Microwave the remaining in 15 second inncrements, stirring in between, until melted. Whisk the reserved yellow buttercream back in until blended. Transfer to a pastry bag without a tip and pipe a thick, wavy layer of \\cheese\\ onto the top of the pizza slice, overlapping the tomato sauce in spots. Pipe cheese over the edges of the slice to look like drips of melted cheese. Spread the fruit rollups flat on a cutting board and stamp out \\pepperoni\\ circles using a 2-inch round cutter sprayed with cooking spray. Top the pizza with as much pepperoni as you like.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33340,&quot;Lemon Sugar Cookie Snowflakes 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 cups salted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon lemon extract 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 eggs<br> 5 cups all-purpose flour, sifted<br> 3 tablespoons Meyer lemon zest 1 to 2 pounds pure white modeling chocolate, such as Sweetastic Serving suggestions: nonpareils, sanding sugar, crystal sugar or other decorations 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1 teaspoon almond extract<br> Instructions: For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the confectioners&#39; sugar and butter. Add the lemon extract, vanilla extract and eggs, and mix until the eggs are incorporated. Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing between each addition, and then add the zest. The dough should be soft, but not sticky. Roll out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper to about 1/4-inch thick. Use snowflake cookie cutters to cut out the cookies (25 to 30 cookies depending on the size) and place on the prepared sheets. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cookies to cooling racks and cool to room temperature before decorating. Roll out the modeling chocolate using a pasta roller or heavy rolling pin to 1/8-inch thick. Using the same snowflake cookie cutter (wiped clean with a paper towel), cut out the snowflake shapes. For the syrup: Warm the corn syrup in the microwave, 20 to 30 seconds, then stir in the almond extract. Using a pastry brush, paint the top of a cookie with the syrup and immediately, but carefully, place a modeling chocolate snowflake on top. Position the modeling chocolate carefully before setting on a cookie, as it will stick very quickly. Rub your fingers over the edges gently to secure the modeling chocolate. Repeat for the remaining cookies. Use the remaining syrup to decorate the cookies. Paint a design, the edges or the entire surface of the cookies, and top with nonpareils, sanding sugar, crystal sugar or other decorations. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 33341,&quot;Ravioli and Vegetable Soup 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, diced 3 medium carrots, halved lengthwise and sliced<br> 3 stalks celery, sliced 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 2 cups fat-free low-sodium beef or vegetable broth 1 9-ounce package small cheese ravioli 1 small bunch escarole or 5 cups spinach, roughly chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese 8 slices whole-wheat baguette Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the broth and 3 cups water and increase the heat to high. Cover and bring to a boil, then add the ravioli. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the ravioli are tender (see label for approximate cooking time).<br> Add the escarole to the soup and cook, stirring, until wilted.

When done, cool to touch; remove the meat from the bones and cut into bite-size pieces. Melt the butter, add the chicken pieces, stir and fry for a few minutes. Add parsley, lemon juice, grated peel, and broth. Add some freshly ground, preferably white, pepper. Gently simmer for 10 minutes. Add cream and reheat the sauce but do not boil. If desired, the sauce could be further thickened with cornstarch or flour, but it is very good this way. Garnish your dish with the lemon slices. Serve with boiled potatoes, a mixture of peas and snow peas, and a salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33343,&quot;Risotto with Italian Sausage 1/4 cup butter, cut in cubes 1/4 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped garlic<br> 2 cups Arborio rice<br> 5 cups chicken stock, plus more if needed<br> 4 large pinches saffron<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish 4 links mild Italian sausage<br> Fresh chopped parsley, for garnish<br> Instructions: Add the butter and olive oil to a medium skillet (cast iron works great). We use nonstick for convenience at the restaurant. When the pan is hot and the butter is melted, add the garlic and then add the rice. Stir the rice and garlic to coat with the oil and butter. Once completely coated, stirring for about a minute, add some of the stock until the rice is slightly covered. Continue to add the stock slowly as the stock is absorbed by the rice. Reduce to medium heat and stir occasionally to prevent sticking to skillet. Once the rice has cooked for 5 to 10 minutes, add the saffron. Continue to add the stock slowly, covering the rice with stock, allowing it to absorb into the rice while cooking and then recovering the rice with stock. This process will be repeated until the rice is cooked to desired tenderness. As the saffron is slowly absorbed into the rice, the risotto will turn a brilliant yellow. If you use stringy style saffron it should all be broken down and absorbed by the time the risotto is finished. (The powder version takes less time to absorb.) Slowly reduce the amount of chicken stock that is added as you reach the desired tenderness, about 45 minutes. Once this magical point is reached, stir in the cheese. Add the sausage to a medium pot of boiling water. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes depending on size and style of sausage. (Don&#39;t pierce the sausage.) Place the desired serving size of risotto on a plate or pasta bowl. Garnish by sprinkling a medium circle of cheese in the middle of the risotto and sprinkle a smaller circle of parsley on top for color. Peel the sausage, slice lengthwise in half and line the boarder of each side of the risotto with the sausage. (Optionally, cut the sausage in 1/4-inch pieces on the bias and add to the risotto before plating.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 33344,&quot;Champagne and Strawberry Shots 1/2 cup cold ginger ale One 1/4-ounce envelope unflavored gelatin 1/4 cup sugar 3/4 cups cold champagne 40 large strawberries Mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: Put the ginger ale in a saucepan, sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the top and let it absorb the liquid for 2 minutes. Bring the ginger ale just to a boil and whisk until gelatin is fully dissolved. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar until dissolved.<br> Transfer the gelatin to a large bowl and stir in the champagne.

If there is extra stuffing bake it in a buttered baking dish next to the turkey in the oven.<br> Roast the stuffed turkey about 3 to 3 1/2 hours, basting often during the last hour of cooking with the buttered rum glaze, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey leg registers 155 degrees F; it will continue cooking for another 20 minutes or so out of the oven. If the turkey skin starts to get too dark, tent it with foil while it roasts.<br> While turkey is cooking, in a small saucepan combine remaining 8 tablespoons of the butter with 1 cup of the brown sugar, ground cinnamon, freshly ground nutmeg, dark rum and a little salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then lower and simmer for 10 minutes until slightly thickened and syrup-like, stirring often.<br> Transfer the turkey to a carving board to rest and loosely tent with foil and allow to cool. Brush the outside of the turkey with syrup mixture to get a glazed look. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 33380,&quot;Chocolate Doughnut Holes 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 3/4 cup sour cream Nonstick cooking spray Vegetable oil or shortening, for frying 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Orange and black nonpareils, for decorating Instructions: Make the doughnut holes: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla and orange zest until light and fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture, alternating with the sour cream, until a sticky dough forms, about 2 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 340 degrees F. Meanwhile, roll out the dough until 1/2 inch thick on a floured surface. (The dough will be sticky.) Cut out rounds using a 1-inch-round cookie cutter, dipping the cutter in flour each time. Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Set a rack on another baking sheet. Working in batches, carefully fry the doughnut holes until puffed and browned, 30 seconds per side. Transfer to the rack using a slotted spoon or wire strainer. Make the glaze: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan and immediately pour over the chocolate; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and smooth, then whisk in the corn syrup and vanilla. Set aside until cooled and thickened, about 5 minutes.

Wrap in aluminum foil. Set aside. Line the loaf pan with plastic wrap so it hangs well out over the edge. (The plastic wrap will be used to help lift the ice cream and cake loaf from the pan when it comes time to frost with meringue, bake and serve.) Spoon the ice cream into the loaf pan. Scatter the dry cherries or candied fruit, if you are using, as you layer the ice cream into the loaf pan. Press down on the ice cream to make it as even as possible. Fill the pan about 3/4 full or to within 1-inch of the top edge of the loaf pan. Place one slice of cake on the ice cream. Place the cardboard on top. Bring the pieces of plastic wrap up over the top of the ice cream loaf to cover, then place in the freezer. The Baked Alaska may be prepared up to two weeks ahead to this point and stored in the freezer before serving. About 30 minutes before you plan to serve the dessert, place the ice cream loaf in the refrigerator to temper slightly if it is very firm. Turn on your broiler. Place the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Whisk to combine. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk gently until sugar dissolves completely (there should be no gritty feeling when you rub some of the mixture between your thumb and index finger), and the egg whites are uniformly hot (about 130 degrees). Remove the bowl from the pan and return to the electric mixer. Whip on medium speed until the meringue is cool and increased in volume. It should be stiff but not dry and lumpy. Unmold the ice cream loaf onto an oven proof serving platter. Top the loaf with another slice of the cake. Frost the cake with the meringue about 1-inch thick. Seal the ice cream loaf completely with meringue. Use a pastry bag fitted with a star tip to pipe additional meringue along the edges for a decorative effect. Immediately place the cake in the oven. Watch the meringue very closely. As it browns, move the pan so that it colors evenly. It should bake no more than 5 or 6 minutes.

In a large bowl, mix the vanilla wafers, apricots, raisins, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Slice the bananas and fold into the dry ingredients. Transfer to the baking dish, distributing evenly. In another bowl, mix eggs, milk, vanilla and amaretto, whiskey or warm water. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the milk and egg mixture over the dry ingredients. Let the baking dish stand for about 20 minutes to allow the liquid to absorb. Prepare a bain marie by placing the baking dish into a larger pan or dish, placing the arrangement into the preheated oven, and then pouring hot water into the outer dish (without splashing any into the custard dish). Bake until the pudding firms and puffs up and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and from water bath. Spread apricot jelly over the top of pudding and let rest. Increase oven heat to 425 degrees F. To make the meringue topping, make a slurry with 1/3 cup water gradually whisked into a small saucepan to which you have added cornstarch and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. As it thickens and becomes translucent, cover and remove it from the heat. In a scrupulously clean large metal or glass bowl, with scrupulously clean beaters, beat the egg whites (they must be at room temperature) until foamy. Add vanilla and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Very gradually beat in sugar on high until glossy and stiff peaks form, but do not allow it to get dry. Reduce the speed of the beater to low and gradually add the cornstarch slurry. When it has all been added increase speed to medium for about 10 seconds. Spread the meringue over the bread pudding, swirling it decoratively with the back of a spoon, and being sure to anchor the meringue to the sides of the baking dish. Bake until the meringue browns, 5 or 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 33396,&quot;Lemon-Basil Granita 1 cup sugar 2 cups loosely packed fresh basil leaves, plus small leaves for garnish<br> 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 to 3 lemons) 1/4 cup vodka, optional<br> Instructions: Combine the sugar with 3 cups water in a medium saucepan.

Then preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the butter and sugar into a saucepan and, when the butter has melted, add the apples, ginger and a tablespoon of the ginger syrup. Slowly cook for 15 minutes with a lid on, then add the blackberries, stir and cook for 5 more minutes with the lid off. Meanwhile, remove your pastry from the refrigerator. Dust your work surface with flour, cut the pastry in half and, using a floured rolling pin, roll 1 of the pieces out until it&#39;s just under 1/2-inch thick or looks as if it will cover a shallow 10-inch pie dish. (Rolling the dough between 2 layers of waxed paper will also stop it sticking to your rolling pin.) Butter the shallow 10-inch pie dish and line with the pastry, trimming off any excess around the edges using a sharp knife. Tip the cooled apples and blackberries into a sieve, reserving all the juices, then put the fruit into the lined pie dish so you have a mound in the middle. Spoon over half the reserved juices, (if desired use all the juice). Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll out the second piece of pastry, just as you did the first, and lay it over the top of the pie. Trim the edges as before and crimp them together with your fingers. Brush the top of the pie with the rest of the beaten egg, sprinkle generously with sugar and the cinnamon, and make a couple of slashes in the top of the pastry. Place the pie on a baking tray and then put it directly on the bottom of the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. To serve, slice the pie into portions and serve with a generous dollop of custard. Old-Fashioned Sweet Shortcrust Pastry Sift the flour from a height onto a clean work surface and sift the icing sugar over the top. Using your hands, work the cubes of butter into the flour and sugar by rubbing your thumbs against your fingers until you end up with a fine, crumbly mixture. This is the point where you can spike the mixture with interesting flavors, so mix in your lemon zest. Add the eggs and milk to the mixture and gently work it together until you have a ball of dough. Flour it lightly. Don&#39;t work the pastry too much at this stage or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short. Flour your work surface and place the dough on top. Pat it into a flat round, flour it lightly, wrap it in plastic wrap and put it into the refrigerator to rest for at least half an hour. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Blend on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Whisk the remaining 1/2 cup oat milk with the tapioca starch in a medium bowl to make a slurry and set aside. Transfer the blended mixture to a medium pot over medium heat. Once it comes to a simmer, whisk in the slurry. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Strain the ice cream base through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the ice cream base to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely chilled, about 3 hours. (For faster chilling, set the bowl of ice cream base in a bowl of ice water and refrigerate.) Pour the chilled base into an ice cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions until it is the consistency of soft-serve (take care not to over-churn to prevent a grainy texture; see Cook\\u2019s Note). Place the ice cream in the freezer to set up for at least 1 hour. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before scooping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33448,&quot;Whole Wheat Cinnamon Rum Rolls 2 scant tablespoons or 2 (1/4-ounce) packages active dry yeast 1/2 cup warm water (about 110 degrees) 1 1/2 cups warm milk (about 110 degrees) 1/2 cup vegetable shortening 1/2 cup honey 3 large eggs 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 teaspoons salt 3 tablespoons soy flour (optional) 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 cups whole wheat flour 1/4 cup melted butter 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar 3 tablespoons cinnamon 1/2 cup raisins (optional) 1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional) 2 cups powdered sugar 1 tablespoon rum extract 5 to 7 tablespoons heavy cream Instructions: In a large bowl, stir yeast into water to soften. Add milk, shortening, honey, eggs, lemon juice, salt, soy flour, and 2 cups whole wheat flour. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Turn dough onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Place dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Turn dough onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Roll each half with a rolling pin into a 12 by 18-inch rectangle. Brush dough with melted butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border along one long side of the rectangle free of butter. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts. Sprinkle evenly over each portion of dough. Roll up into 2 (18-inch) cylinders and pinch the loose edge to the cylinder. Cut into 30 rolls (15 from each cylinder) and place cut-side up into 2 parchment-lined 9 by 13-inch pans. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees (350 if using glass pans). Bake for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the rolls reaches 190 degrees. Leave the rolls in the pan to cool since they benefit from the steam -- it makes them softer. Allow the rolls to cool for 15 minutes. Combine powdered sugar, rum extract, and milk. Mixture should be the consistency of honey (if it isn&#39;t, adjust by adding more cream to thin it or powdered sugar to thicken it). Drizzle over the top of the rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 33449,&quot;Shark Beach Pull-Apart Cupcakes One 15.25-ounce box vanilla cake mix (plus required ingredients) Three 6-ounce cans vanilla frosting Blue gel food coloring, for the frosting Yellow gel food coloring, for the frosting 1 1/2 cups teddy bear-shaped graham snacks 2 pretzel rods 3 spearmint candy leaves 6 chocolate-covered peanuts One 6-inch piece striped sour candy strip, such as Sour Candy Belts 2 rolls red fruit leather rounds, such as Joray One 10-inch piece black licorice lace 4 gummy sharks Instructions: For the cupcakes: Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners; fill 9 with yellow liners and 15 with blue liners. Prepare the cupcakes according to the package directions. Transfer to cooling racks and cool completely. For the frosting: Color 3 cups of the frosting with blue gel food coloring until sea blue (12 to 14 drops). Color 2 cups of the frosting with yellow food coloring until pale yellow (2 to 3 drops). Keep the remaining 1 cup frosting white and transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a medium petal tip.<br> Arrange the cupcakes in a 4-by-6 grid on a cutting board or a flat square serving platter, keeping the yellow liners together to make the sandy beach and the blue liners together to make the water. There will be 1 yellow liner in the row where the blue and yellow meet; keep it to the far left.<br> With an ice cream scoop, scoop balls of blue frosting on the blue-lined cupcakes and yellow frosting on the yellow-lined cupcakes. Smooth the frosting across the cupcakes with an offset spatula so the blue and yellow almost meet; the line where they touch should be a gradual diagonal that looks like the shoreline when a wave comes in.<br> Set aside 6 teddy bears. Put the rest in a food processor and process to crumbs. Reserve about 1/4 cup or so of the crumbs to anchor the palm trees later. Sprinkle the remainder over the yellow frosting to make sand.<br> Pipe waves of white frosting along the shoreline where the sand meets the surf.<br> Break off one end of the pretzel rods to make two 5-inch rods; discard (or eat) the smaller pieces from each rod. Cut the spearmint leaves in half crosswise and roll them out to flatten slightly. Press 3 leaf pieces into the broken end of each pretzel rod to resemble palm tree leaves. (If you have having trouble getting the leaves to stick, you can brush with a tiny bit of water at the spot where they adhere). Press 2 chocolate-covered peanuts on top of the leaves to make coconuts. Stick the trees into the sand in the spaces where the cupcakes meet. Spoon the remaining graham cracker crumbs around the bottoms of the trees to anchor them. Add a chocolate-covered peanut under each as a dropped coconut.<br> Cut the sour candy strip into 4 equal pieces. Arrange on the sand for beach towels and lay a bear on top of each one.<br> For the surfboards, unwrap and flatten the fruit roll up rounds. Fold each into quarters and press to adhere. Cut a 2 1/2-inch oval surfboard shape from each. Cut the black licorice into strips for lines on the surfboards (2 lines per board), but don&#39;t stick them on yet. Place the surfboards on a piece of parchment and microwave just until warm, about 10 seconds. Press on the licorice lines and microwave just until they stick, about 5 seconds more. Press a standing bear on each for a surfer and let cool. (You can put in the freezer to hasten the process.)<br> Place the surfing bears on the water. Place the sharks on the water.

Flame several orange peels into the glass. Add the vodka and strain into the seasoned glass. Garnish with an orange peel. Flaming: You can create a festive pyrotechnic display for your guests with the oil present in the skin of lemons and oranges. To flame the oil, hold a lit match in one hand, and the twist in the other. Hold the twist by the side not the ends, between thumb and forefinger, skin side down, about 4 inches above the drink. Don&#39;t squeeze or you&#39;ll lose all the oil before you flame. Hold the match between the drink and the twist, closer to the twist. Snap the twist sharply, propelling the oil through the lit match and onto the surface of the drink. (Be sure to hold twist far enough from the drink to avoid getting a smoky film on the glass.) &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Cava, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 33453,&quot;Crispy Colorado Trout One 8-ounce fresh Colorado trout, cleaned and separated into fillets 1 egg 1/2 cup milk Salt and freshly ground black pepper All-purpose flour, for dusting Panko bread crumbs Olive oil, for sauteing trout 1 tablespoon capers 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon roasted garlic Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley 2 whole scallions, cleaned and chopped Chevre Orzo, recipe follows 1 pound orzo 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 to 1/2 pound chevre 1/2 cup peeled, seeded, and diced tomatoes 8 to 10 basil leaves cut into a chiffonade 2 tablespoons chopped parsley 2 green onions, sliced thinly on the bias Instructions: Preparing Trout: After de-boning, finning, cleaning, and filleting fish, rinse and pat dry. Combine egg and milk in a shallow dish to make an egg wash. Dredge trout in seasoned flour shaking off excess. Dip into egg wash mixture, and then into panko crumbs, turning to coat both sides and patting lightly. Remove fillets and place separately onto platter. Use waxed paper to keep fish from touching. Preparing Aioli Sauce: Place all ingredients into blender except for olive oil, and puree. Add a little water to loosen, if needed. Once you have reached the puree stage, slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream. This will cause the ingredients to emulsify. Set aside. Cooking Trout: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a heavy saute pan, coat bottom with 1/8-inch of oil. Heat pan and oil to medium heat. Add fillet skin side up and cook for about 1 1/2 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet set over moderately low heat, melt the butter, add the rosemary and cook it, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. As soon as the pasta is cooked, drain and add it to the pan. Add the cream, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Toss to coat and let reduce 1 to 2 minutes, gently stirring, or until lightly thickened. Add Parmesan to taste, toss to combine and transfer to serving dish. Sprinkle with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 33486,&quot;Cheesy Hasselback Potatoes 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 6 cloves garlic, minced or finely diced<br> 6 medium Yukon potatoes, scrubbed and dried Kosher salt and ground black pepper 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and line a baking sheet with foil. In a small saucepot, bring the butter, oil and garlic to a boil over high heat; remove from the heat. Using 2 wooden spoons placed on each side of a potato as a guide, cut the potato into thin slices about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick, without cutting through the bottom (the spoons will keep you from cutting all the way through the potato). Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Place the potatoes on the prepared baking sheet and brush each potato with some of the butter mixture, trying to get the butter between the slices. Sprinkle each potato with salt and pepper. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the potatoes from the oven. The potatoes will have started to spread out from cooking and it will be easier to brush each slice with some more of the butter mixture. Put the potatoes back in the oven for an additional 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven again and sprinkle the Parmesan over the top and into the slices. Return to the oven to melt and brown the cheese, an additional 5 minutes. Serve the potatoes immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 33487,&quot;Beef and Spinach Breakfast Sandwich 12 ounces cooked beef (such as steak, roast, pot roast or deli roast beef), thinly sliced 4 eggs or 1 cup egg substitute 1/2 cup chopped fresh baby spinach 1/2 cup diced tomatoes Salt and pepper (optional) 4 slices reduced-fat Swiss cheese 4 whole wheat round thin sandwich breads, split, toasted Instructions: 1)Combine eggs, spinach and tomato in medium bowl.

Halve the squash lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Sprinkle the cut sides with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then brush both sides with olive oil. Put the squash, cut-side up, in a baking dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Roast 20 minutes, then uncover and continue roasting until the squash is tender, about 35 more minutes. Meanwhile, make the meatballs: Brush a baking sheet with olive oil. Pulse the celery, carrot, onion, garlic and parsley in a food processor to make a paste. Transfer half of the vegetable paste to a bowl; add the ground beef, ground pork, eggs, breadcrumbs, 1 cup parmesan and 1 teaspoon salt and mix with your hands until just combined. Form into about 24 two-inch meatballs; transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until firm but not cooked through, about 10 minutes. Make the sauce: Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the remaining vegetable paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until it looks dry, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato puree; rinse each can with 1 cup water and add to the pot. Stir in the basil, oregano and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a simmer, then add the meatballs and simmer until the sauce thickens and the meatballs are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the basil. Use a fork to scrape the spaghetti squash flesh into strands; transfer to a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons grated parmesan. Season with salt. Divide the squash among bowls and top each with some meatballs, sauce and the remaining 1 tablespoon parmesan. This recipe makes extra sauce and meatballs. Let cool completely, then freeze in a storage container for up to one month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 33489,&quot;Severed Hand Sangria Filtered water (enough to fill latex glove)<br> 2 bottles Dry red wine 3 cups Sparkling water 3 cups Freshly squeezed orange juice 3 oz Brandy (or Cointreau) 3 tbsp Brown sugar 2 Fresh oranges, thinly sliced 2 Fresh pink grapefruit, thinly sliced 2 Fresh lemons, thinly sliced 2 Fresh limes, thinly sliced 1 cup natural sour cherries in syrup Instructions: The night before the party, fill a few latex gloves with some filtered water, tie them up like you would a balloon and freeze overnight.

Carefully remove the coconut milk cans from the refrigerator so the fat and liquid remain separated. Spoon the hardened coconut cream from the can and place in a large bowl (save the liquid for another use, such as smoothies). Beat the coconut cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy and medium peaks form. Reduce the speed to low and add the confectioners\\u2019 sugar, vanilla, ground ginger, zest of 1/2 lime and salt and beat until just combined. Gently fold in the crystalized ginger with a rubber spatula. Place 8 of the Gingersnap Cookies in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared loaf pan (they may overlap just slightly and that is okay). Spread a heaping 1/2 cup of the coconut cream mixture on top, then repeat the process 4 more times, ending with the remaining coconut cream on top. Garnish with the zest from the other lime half, the toasted coconut and sprinkles (if using). Cover and refrigerate until the cookies are completely softened, 6 hours and up to overnight. Stir together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, allspice, baking soda, cloves and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high speed until light, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and add the egg and molasses. Beat until well combined. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until the dough comes together and cleans the sides of the bowl. Divide the dough into 2 portions. Lay out a piece of plastic wrap about 16 inches long. Form one portion of the dough into a log and place at one end of the plastic. Roll the plastic around the dough and roll with your hands to make a log about 8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Twist the ends to seal well. Repeat with the remaining dough. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours. (You can also freeze the dough, using directly from the freezer.) To bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with a rack in the top and bottom thirds. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the plastic from a dough log and cut 1/4-inch-thick rounds (a serrated knife works well), placing them about an inch apart on the baking sheets. Bake, rotating the sheets from top to bottom halfway through, until the cookies are crisp and golden on the bottoms and edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33491,&quot;Pesto Potato and Green Bean Salad 1 1/2 pounds new red potatoes, washed and cut into 1-inch chunks 1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces 1/3 cup Basil Pesto, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup pine nuts 1 clove garlic, peeled 3 cups lightly packed fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil Instructions: Place the potatoes in a large steamer basket fitted over a pot of boiling water. Cover and steam for 5 minutes. Add the green beans to the potatoes in the steamer and continue to cook, covered, for another 4 minutes. Drain and immediately plunge into an ice bath to cool. Transfer the vegetables to a large serving bowl. Add the pesto and stir to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper and serve. Make a big batch of this pesto in the summer when the basil is fresh and plentiful. You can freeze it in ice cube trays, bag up the cubes, and have it year-round to use as a pasta sauce or to enhance the flavor of one. It is also excellent as a sandwich spread. Toast the pine nuts in a small, dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant and golden brown, shaking the pan frequently, about 3 minutes. In a food processor, process the pine nuts and garlic together until minced. Add the basil, Parmesan, lemon juice, and salt and pepper and process until finely minced. With the machine running, slowly pour the oil in a steady stream through the feed tube and process until well blended. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33492,&quot;Buttermilk Chess Pie with Georgia Peach Topping 1 store-bought 9-inch round pie dough 4 tablespoons salted butter, melted<br> 4 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup sorghum or honey<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup whole buttermilk<br> 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> One 16-ounce bag frozen peaches (about 3 1/2 cups) 1/3 cup orange juice<br> 1/4 cup sorghum or honey<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 bunch fresh mint Instructions: For the buttermilk chess pie: Place a baking sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine on low until the sugar is incorporated, then raise the speed to high and whip for 10 minutes. Turn to low speed and add half of the butter to combine, then turn off the mixer and add the remaining butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the whisk, then whip on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Hold at room temperature until using. For the cake: Preheat oven to 335 degrees F. Spray three 8-inch, three 6-inch and three 4-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment. Spray the parchment.<br> Sift 2 3/4 cups cake flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Combine on low for 30 seconds.<br> Whisk together 3/4 cup melted butter, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup oil, 3 eggs, 1 egg yolk, 1 tablespoon vanilla and a third of the zest in a medium bowl.<br> With the mixer running on low, add about half of the wet ingredients and blend until a smooth paste forms. Scrape down the bowl and paddle with your spatula.<br> Turn the mixer on low and add the remaining wet ingredients. Raise the mixer speed to medium and beat for 1 full minute.<br> Repeat 2 more times with the remaining ingredients in the same manner. Divide the batter among the pans, pouring 26 ounces into each of the 8-inch pans, 17 ounces into each of the 6-inch pans and 8 ounces into each of the 4-inch pans.<br> Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out with some moist crumbs adhering, 28 to 32 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto cooling racks and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Build the cake: Trim off the domed tops from the cake layers using a long, serrated knife. Transfer some of the buttercream to a piping bag fitted with an open coupler. Place one 8-inch layer on an 8-inch cake board and evenly pipe a layer of buttercream across the top. Place a second 8-inch cake layer on top, and repeat the process, topping with the third 8-inch cake layer. Refrigerate until the buttercream is firm, 20 to 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, repeat this process with the 6-inch and 4-inch cake layers. Place the 8-inch tier on a turntable. Using an offset spatula, cover the tier with a generous amount of buttercream. Use a bench scraper or plastic scraper to carefully scrape away most of the buttercream, leaving behind a \\naked\\ rustic appearance. Refrigerate until the buttercream is firm, 20 to 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, repeat this process with the 6-inch and 4-inch cake tiers. To stack the cake: Transfer the 8-inch tier to a cake stand or decorative cake board. Trim 6 smoothie straws to the height of the cake and insert them vertically throughout the 8-inch tier (this will provide support for the 6-inch tier, so be sure that they are inserted within 3 inches of the center of the cake). Trim 4 smoothie straws to the height of the cake and insert them throughout the 6-inch tier (within 2 inches of the center of the cake) to provide support for the 4-inch tier. Spread a small amount of buttercream on top of the 8-inch tier to help adhere, and using a large offset spatula, carefully transfer the 6-inch tier to the top of the 8-inch tier. Spread a small amount of buttercream on top of the 6-inch tier to help adhere, and using a large offset spatula, carefully transfer the 4-inch tier to the top of the 6-inch tier.<br> Decorate with sugar flowers as desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33508,&quot;Yogurt Parfait 1/2 cup blueberries 1/2 cup raspberries<br> 1/2 cup quartered strawberries<br> 3 tablespoons sugar<br> 3 3/4 cups vanilla yogurt<br> 3/4 cup granola (without raisins)<br> 5 tablespoons honey<br> Instructions: Combine the blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in a bowl.

A wonderful way to serve it is to place the bowls before your guests, with the oysters and asparagus already set in them. Then, bring a tureen to the table and ladle the veloute over all. As a main course: If you simply increase the amount of oysters and asparagus-say 8 per person rather than 4-you&#39;ll have a light but filling main-course soup. Serve warmed French bread with it, and a light frilly salad tossed with fresh goat cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 33528,&quot;Lima Beans and Pork Chops 2 cups fresh green lima beans 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish 2 teaspoons chopped fresh summer savory 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 (1-inch thick) pork chops 2 cups fine bread crumbs, toasted 1 cup sour cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

When I was growing up, my father would always serve a huge salad and say \\You always need a few leaves to feel good. It is his salads that I carried with me throughout my career as a chef and mother. In a large skillet, over medium heat, add the bacon and 1/2 cup water. Bring the water to a boil and reduce until it evaporates. The bacon will start to render its fat and brown. Lower the heat and allow to cook at a slow, steady pace. When the bacon is crispy and light brown, drain the fat into a medium-size bowl and set the bacon aside. Put the shallots on a flat surface and cut them into thin rounds. Transfer to a large salad bowl and season them with salt, to taste. Add the red wine vinegar and mustard and stir to blend. Stir in the bacon fat, tasting as you go. Start with about 1/4 cup of the fat and taste as you add the rest. There should be a good balance between the bacon flavor and the acidity of the red wine vinegar. Set aside. Put the radishes on a cutting board and, using a small, sharp knife, slice them into 1/4-inch rounds (with the bit of the tops still attached). Add them to a small bowl and stir in the mustard.

Heat over low heat just to a simmer. Remove from the heat and chill in an ice bath. Combine the cooled marinade and the shrimp in a large bowl and toss to coat. Cover and let marinate for at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour. Strain the shrimp and discard the marinade. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Once the skillet is super-hot, add the canola oil and then the shrimp; cook until the shrimp are pink and nicely-browned at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the shrimp to a serving dish and garnish with cilantro if desired. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33554,&quot;Endive Stuffed with Goat Cheese and Smoked Salmon and Cheesy Chicken Bon-Bons 1 1/2 cups goat cheese, at room temperature (12 ounces) 1 cup cream cheese, at room temperature (8 ounces) 3 tablespoons heavy cream 1 teaspoon lemon zest 3 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 1 cup smoked salmon, minced 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh dill 1 teaspoon finely minced Italian flat-leaf parsley 2 to 3 heads endive, chilled (about 24 leaves) 1 tablespoon lemon zest 1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted 1 1/2 ounces salmon roe, for garnish, optional 10 bone-in chicken thighs 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1/4 cup sour cream 1/4 cup fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely minced (you can use dried parsley but use less) Dash Worcestershire sauce Pinch cayenne pepper 1 large package animal crackers 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh chives 1 teaspoon finely minced fresh dill 1 clove garlic, finely minced 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon white vinegar Instructions: For the goat cheese filling: Mix the goat cheese, 1/2 cup of the cream cheese, the cream, lemon zest, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, vinegar, 2 tablespoons salt and pepper in the bowl of a mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium-low speed until well blended and creamy. Remove half of the goat cheese filling to a separate bowl and add in the remaining 1/2 cup cream cheese. Set aside and chill for the cheesy chicken bon-bons.<br> For the salmon stuffed endive: Add the salmon, the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice, the dill and parsley to the first half of the goat cheese filling. Mix to combine well. Check the seasoning; you may want to add some salt or pepper but that will depend on the flavor your salmon has. Transfer the filling into a zip-top bag and cut the tip to make a medium opening, or use a pastry bag with a medium tip. The filling is dense so you need a larger opening to pipe it. You can also use a spoon to fill the endive but piping is faster. Pipe the mixture onto the tip of the endive. Keep the endive chilled until serving time.<br> To serve, garnish with a bit of lemon zest, a sprinkle of toasted almonds and a bit of the salmon roe if using on top.<br> For the chicken bon-bons: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the chicken thighs on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 35 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F and roast for 10 minutes more (about 15 minutes per pound cooking time, depending on the size of the thighs. To check doneness, pierce the thigh in the thickest part; if the juices run clear, it is likely done). Set aside to cool. Remove the chicken from the bone and mince; not too fine, but not big chunks, either. While the chicken is cooling, mix the sour cream, parsley, chives, dill, garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne and a big pinch salt into the reserved goat cheese filling. Add the chopped chicken and chill again. Select 15 to 20 of the animal crackers for garnish. Put 2 cups of the remaining animal crackers into a food processor and pulse to make them into fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs onto a plate. Using a very small ice cream scoop (so you have consistent size), scoop the chicken mixture and roll into small balls. Roll in the crumbs and garnish with an animal cracker. Do this final step just before serving so the cracker crumbs don&#39;t get too damp.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 33555,&quot;How to Make Homemade Chicken Cordon Bleu | Chicken Cordon Bleu 4 tablespoon butter 1 cup flour 4 boneless, skinless breasts of chicken 2 eggs lightly beaten 4 very thin slices smoked ham 2 cups bread crumbs 6 ounces Lorraine Swiss cheese, cut into four chunks Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Set aside an ungreased 9- by 13-inch pan. For the crust, place the cake mix, melted butter, and egg in a large mixing bowl. Blend with an electric mixer on low speed for two minutes. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. The batter should come together in a ball. With your fingertips, pat the batter evenly over the bottom of the pan, smoothing it out with your fingers until the top is smooth. Set the pan aside. For the filling, rinse and dry the lemons well. Grate the zest from the lemons and set aside; you should have about 2 teaspoons. Cut the lemons in half, and squeeze into a small bowl; you should have about 6 tablespoons. Set the juice aside. Place the cream cheese in the same mixing bowl that was used to make the crust, and with the same beaters (no need to clean either) blend with an electric mixer on low speed until fluffy, 30 seconds. Stop the machine and add the lemon juice, lemon zest, eggs, melted butter, and cornmeal and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Stop the machine and add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Beat on medium speed until the sugar is well incorporated, 1 minute more. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with the rubber spatula so that the filling covers the entire surface and reaches the sides of the pan. Place the pan in the oven. Bake the cake until it is well browned but the center still jiggles when you shake the pan, 45 to 47 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool, 30 minutes. Cut into squares and serve. Store this cake, covered in aluminum foil, at room temperature for up to 4 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Or freeze it, wrapped in foil, for up to 6months. Thaw the cake overnight in the refrigerator before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33560,&quot;Banana Bread Bombe Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing the pan 1 cup sugar 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 large eggs 3 ripe bananas (about 1 pound) 2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk Two 3.4-ounce boxes instant banana pudding mix 4 cups heavy cream One 15-ounce box vanilla wafer cookies (about 95 cookies) Warm caramel sauce, for drizzling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Cream the sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.<br> Mash the bananas in a small bowl (you should have about 1 cup), add to the mixing bowl and beat until just combined. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and 1 tablespoon of the milk and beat until just combined.<br> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then invert the bread onto the rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.<br> Add the pudding mix to a large bowl and whisk in the heavy cream. Whip until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. (It&#39;s fine if there are still a few granules in the mix; they will dissolve once set.)<br> Slice the banana bread into 18 slices, each about 1/3 inch thick. Set aside.<br> Line a large glass bowl (10 inches wide at the top, 5 1/2 inches wide at the bottom and 4 inches tall) with plastic wrap, leaving at least 1 inch of overhang on all sides. Quickly submerge 1 vanilla wafer cookie into the remaining 1 cup milk, then place the cookie rounded-side up in the bottom of the prepared glass bowl. Continue to dip the cookies and line the bowl until you reach the very top of the bowl, using 55 to 60 cookies total. The cookies should not go over the edge of the bowl, so trim them if necessary.<br> Scoop 2 cups of the pudding over the cookies in the bowl, then use the back of a large wooden spoon to gently spread the pudding in one layer over all the cookies, making sure to go all the way to the top of the bowl. Spoon 1 cup of the pudding into the bottom of the bowl and spread it out into a flat layer. Top the pudding with some banana bread slices until mostly covered (you may need to cut up some of the pieces in order for them to fit properly). Top with 1/2 cup of the pudding and spread evenly to cover the bread. Repeat with another layer of banana bread, followed by 3/4 cup of the pudding. Repeat one more time, with another layer of banana bread and the remaining pudding (you will have more bread left).<br> Dip about 35 more cookies into the milk and lay in a flat layer over the top of the pudding. Top with the remaining banana bread slices. Fold over the plastic wrap to cover the bowl. Refrigerate until completely chilled and the cookies have softened, at least 6 hours and up to overnight.<br> When ready to serve, carefully invert the bowl onto a large serving platter or cutting board, then use the plastic wrap lining to ease the bombe out of the bowl.

Add the mussels and 1/2 cup vermouth. Cook for 1 minute. Add about 3/4 cup cold water. The mussels shouldn&#39;t take long to cook, about 2 minutes. Take care to stir the mussels from time to time so they cook as evenly as possible. Use kitchen tongs to pluck the mussels from the pan as they open. When all of the mussels are cooked, strain, and reserve the liquid for the sauce. Remove the mussels from their shells. Discard the shells. Reserve the mussels in the refrigerator until 5 minutes before serving. Using a small paring knife, quarter the mushrooms. Heat another skillet large enough to hold the mushrooms in a single layer. Heat the skillet slightly and then remove the pan from direct heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter, melt quickly and turn a light brown color.

Add the remaining vermouth. Cook for an additional 1 minute and then drain out any cooking liquid. Combine the mushroom and the mussel liquids in a small pan and allow the 2 flavors to simmer together for 1 minute. The sauce may need a pinch of salt. The flavor should be an initial taste of sweet mussel followed by an undertone of earthiness from the mushroom. Swirl 1 tablespoon butter and a touch of lemon juice. Keep warm. Heat the large skillet until hot, 2 minutes. Remove from the direct heat and add 1 tablespoon butter. When it turns light brown, return the skillet to the burner and add the mussels and mushrooms in a single layer. Cook for 1 minute without stirring them.

Split the vanilla beans down the middle lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a paring knife; add them to the pot and toss in the pods for added flavor. Place the cream mixture over medium heat, and bring up to a simmer; stirring with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar. Ideally, the temperature should reach 175 degrees F (just below scalding) for a smooth-textured ice cream; this should take about 15 minutes. Shut off the heat, cover the pot, and allow the cream mixture to steep for 15 minutes to further infuse the vanilla flavor. In the meantime, combine the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl and blend them lightly with a wire whisk. Gradually add the remaining 1 cup of sugar and continue to whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved and the eggs are thick and pale yellow; about 6 minutes. Using a large ladle or measuring cup, temper the eggs by gradually whisking in about 4 cups of the hot cream mixture. Return this back to the rest of the cream in the saucepan and turn the heat to medium-low. Stir constantly until the custard thickens and leaves a path on the back of a spoon when you run your finger across it, about 10 to 12 minutes (do not let boil.) Pour the vanilla custard through a fine strainer into another pot* and chill completely in a sink full of ice, stirring here and there; this should take about 1 hour. Ideally, let the ice cream base \\age\\ overnight in the refrigerator before churning in an ice cream maker to improve the flavor and texture of the final product ? but it is still good if you decide to process it right away. Divide the ice cream into quarts** and churn each in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. When done, the ice cream will be the consistency of \\soft serve.\\ ***To harden the ice cream fully, freeze in plastic covered containers.

Pour 1 quart of the strained hot vanilla ice cream base into the melted chocolate and stir until very well incorporated. Chill and process as directed in the master recipe. Fold in the remaining 4 ounces of chopped chocolate after churning while the ice cream is in the \\soft-serve\\ stage. Churn another 1 to 2 minutes just until combined. **To make the Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream: Mix the strawberry preserves into the vanilla custard just before you start churning in the ice cream maker.

Allow the porcini to soak for a few minutes or until soft. Then finely chop the porcini to a paste-like consistency. On a work table, peel and mash the potatoes with the back of a fork or use a potato ricer. Add the porcini to the mashed potatoes and then add the flour, Parmigiano, salt, and pepper. Combine together and knead until the mixture becomes regular dough consistency, smooth and slightly sticky. Add more flour if needed, which will absorb any excess moisture. On a lightly-floured work surface, take pieces of the dough and roll them out into thin logs, approximately 1/2-inches thick. Cut them 1-inch long. Make the ridges on each gnocchi by using the back of a fork in a rolling action. Cook&#39;s Note: The imprints will allow the sauce to get trapped on the surface of the gnocchi. Put the gnocchi on a tray in a single layer and place a cloth over the top to prevent them from drying out. They may also be set in refrigerator or freezer until needed. Cook the gnocchi in a pot of boiling salted water for about 1 to 2 minutes or until they float to the surface. For the sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the fresh sage leaves. Remove the gnocchi from the boiling water with a slotted spoon or drain and add them directly to the saucepan with about 1/2 cup pasta water. Cook the gnocchi with the sauce for about 30 seconds and then remove them from the heat. Add the Parmigiano and mix well.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners, and lightly coat with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl; set aside. Bring the cocoa powder, milk and 1/2 cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, and whisk until the cocoa dissolves into a smooth, thicker mixture, about 3 minutes. Stir in the vanilla, and set aside until just slightly warm to the touch. Beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until combined and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition. Continue to beat while slowly pouring the cocoa mixture into the bowl (be sure to scrape out any cocoa that coats the saucepan) just until incorporated, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to medium, add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Finish stirring by hand to avoid overmixing. Divide the batter evenly among the lined muffin cups, and bake until the cupcakes bounce back when gently pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let them cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Unwrap each cupcake, and use a small knife to cut out a small \\plug\\ of cake in the middle of each bottom, cutting about halfway through the cupcake. For the filling: Beat the marshmallow, confectioners&#39; sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a medium bowl until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large resealable plastic bag, and snip off one corner. Pipe the filling into the holes cut out of the cupcakes; use the plugs or scraps of the cake you removed to plug the holes back up. For the glaze: Combine the butter, chocolate, honey and salt in a small microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and poke a hole in it to vent. Microwave on high (at 100 percent power) for about 1 minute, until the butter and most of the chocolate is melted. Whisk until smooth; let cool, 15 to 20 minutes. Dip the top of each cupcake in the glaze, and let it set up, about 30 minutes. For the icing: Put the filled and glazed cupcakes on a rack set over a baking sheet or piece of parchment. Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter and 2 tablespoons water together in a small bowl. Top each cupcake with a drizzle of icing; let harden, about 10 minutes. Put the finished cupcakes in fresh liners. The cupcakes can be baked, filled, glazed and iced a day ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 33602,&quot;Green Apple-Truffle Slaw 4 large cloves garlic, unpeeled 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup grapeseed oil 5 Granny Smith apples, julienned 1/2 small head green cabbage, very thinly sliced (about 4 cups) 1/3 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon black truffle oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Place a disc of frozen chocolate-hazelnut spread on 4 of the pancakes and overturn the 4 remaining pancakes on top of those, so the wet batter envelopes the discs. Put the remaining discs back in the freezer. Continue to cook the pancakes, flipping halfway, until the edges are set, about 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining batter and discs, lightly oiling the griddle in between batches. Dust the pancakes with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm with syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 33616,&quot;Strawberry Rhubarb Zinfandel Crepes About 3 ounces (85 grams) cake flour About 3 ounces (85 grams) bread flour About 1.5 ounces (43 grams) sugar 1 teaspoon salt 3 eggs 3 egg yolks 1 1/2 cups milk About 3 ounces (85 grams) melted butter 3 pints strawberries, hulled About 7 ounces (187 grams) sugar 1/2 whole nutmeg, crushed About 11 ounces (300 ml) Zinfandel About 6 cups (1.5 liter) water About 7 ounces (75 g) fresh ginger 1 vanilla bean, split 1.5 pounds rhubarb, cut into large chunks About 7 ounces (200 grams) sugar 1/2 pound butter, room temperature 1/4 cup rhubarb syrup 3 pints strawberries, hulled and quartered Some rhubarb butter 2 tablespoons vanilla sugar Raspberry vinegar Vanilla sugar Crushed pink peppercorns Ice cream Instructions: For the crepes: In a bowl, whisk dry ingredients together. In a separate bowl, whisk wet ingredients together. Slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet. Chill for 1 hour. Strain, if necessary. Add enough batter to a hot pan to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. Cook crepe for a minute or so or until the bottom of the crepe edges start to curl. Flip over and cook for about 30 seconds. Remove each crepe and stack on a plate. Set aside until ready to fill. For the Strawberry Zinfandel syrup: Add all ingredients into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced about 3/4 of the way. Strain and then continue to reduce to a medium syrup. For the rhubarb syrup: Place the ingredients into a large pot, cover with water and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced about 3/4. Strain and then continue to reduce to a heavy syrup. For the rhubarb butter: Place ingredients into a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle and cream until homogenous. This can alternately be done with a hand mixer. For the sauteed strawberries: Saute strawberries in a small amount of rhubarb butter until slightly soft. Add vanilla sugar. Deglaze with raspberry vinegar. Spread on sheet pan to cool. Fill crepes with some of the strawberry mixture and a little more rhubarb butter. Fold into quarters and place on sizzle platter, 3 at a time, dotted with a small amount of rhubarb butter.

Using a fork, mash the beans in a medium bowl until they are mushy but still have some whole bean pieces throughout. Make the burger mixture. Mix the breadcrumbs, grated onion, chili powder, egg and some salt and pepper into the beans. Add a splash of water if the mixture looks dry. Set aside for 5 minutes. Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add a few tablespoons of canola oil. Form the patties. Divide the bean mixture into 4 equal balls and form into 4 nice, neat patties. Black bean burgers don&#39;t shrink when they cook, so whatever size you make them when they go into the skillet will be the size they are when they come out. Cook the burgers. Cook the burgers until browned, 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Add a slice of Swiss cheese to the top of each burger. Invert a second skillet on top of the first skillet and continue cooking, 2 minutes, until the cheese is melted. Top the burgers. Combine the mayonnaise and some hot sauce in a small bowl. Serve the burgers on toasted buns with the spicy mayonnaise, lettuce and sliced tomatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 33623,&quot;Butterscotch Blondies 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup pecans, toasted and chopped 1/2 cup white chocolate chips 1/2 cup dried cranberries Butterscotch sauce, for drizzling Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling, optional Instructions: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Prepare the beets by cutting off the 2 ends and the greens. (The greens can be used in another recipe if you like...) Next, rub down the beets with olive oil and wrap them in tin foil. Place them in a shallow pan or dish and bake them for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until a knife slides in and out of the beets easily. When the beets are finished, rubbing the skins off with a towel can peel them. Julienne the beets. Prepare the trout by skinning and deboning it, and shredding it to the size you prefer. I like to shred it very finely, so that every bite of salad has a bite of trout. If you can find already deboned smoked trout, it will reduce your prep time significantly. Place the lettuce and spinach on a plate and build the other ingredients onto the salad, as you like. I like to run each ingredient down the side of the mountain of greens in sections and mix as I eat. Dress the salad with Green Goddess Dressing, and serve with a fresh baguette. Mix everything in a 2-quart bowl or larger. Can be stored in your refrigerator for up to 7 days. If you like your dressing greener, increase the herbs. If you like your dressing leaner, leave out buttermilk and add 1/2 cup yogurt to replace it. And if you like it meaner, up the herbs, the pepper (or use white pepper!), and the garlic! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 33637,&quot;Rice Paper Wrapped Salad Rolls 1/3 pound pork shoulder, untrimmed, cut into 2 pieces 12 medium raw shrimp, unpeeled 4 ounces bun (rice vermicelli or rice sticks), boiled for 5 minutes, rinsed and drained, see Cook?s Note 1 cup bean sprouts 1/2 cup mint leaves 1 small head red-leaf lettuce, leaves separated and washed 8 (12-inch) dried rice papers, round, plus extras 1/2 cup Vietnamese Bean Dipping Sauce, for serving, recipe follows 1/4 cup fermented whole soybeans 1/2 cup water 1/3 cup unsweetened coconut milk 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 3 tablespoons chopped yellow onion 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon ground cl paste, or to taste, as an accompaniment 1 tablespoon chopped roasted peanuts, for garnish, recipe follows 1 cup raw, shelled peanuts, skin removed Instructions: Cook the pork in boiling salted water until it?s done but still firm enough for slicing, about 30 minutes. While the pork is cooking, bring another small pot of water to a boil. Add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink, about 3 minutes. Rinse under running water and set aside to drain. When cool enough to handle, peel, de-vein, and cut in half lengthwise. Refresh in cold water and set aside. Remove pork from the heat and drain. When it is cool enough to handle, slice into thin slices, about 1 by 2 1/2 inches. Place on a small plate and set aside. Set up a salad roll \\station.\\ Line a cutting board with a damp kitchen towel. Fill a large bowl with hot water and place it nearby. (Keep some boiling water handy to add to the bowl.) Arrange the ingredients in the order they will be used: the shrimp, pork, rice vermicelli, bean sprouts, mint and lettuce. Working with 2 rice paper rounds at a time, dip 1, edge first into the hot water and turn it to wet completely, about 10 seconds. Lay the round down on the towel. Repeat with the second rice paper and place it alongside the first. This allows you to work with 1 while the second is being set. Line the bottom third of the rice paper round with 3 shrimp halves, cut side up, and top with 2 slices of pork. Add 1 tablespoon rice vermicelli, 1 tablespoon bean sprouts, and 4 to 5 mint leaves. (Arrange the ingredients so the rolls will end up being about 5 inches long and 1-inch wide.) Halve a lettuce leaf lengthwise along the center rib. Roll up in 1 piece and place on the filling. (Trim if it?s too long.) While pressing down on the ingredients, lift the bottom edge over the filling, then fold in 2 sides. Roll into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inches wide and 4 to 5 inches long. If the paper feels thick, stop three-quarters of the way and trim the end piece. (Too much rice paper can make the rolls chewy.) Repeat with the remaining rice papers and filling. To serve, cut rolls into 2 or 4 pieces and place them upright on a plate. Serve with the sauce on the side. Place the soybeans, water, coconut milk, vinegar, onion and sugar in a blender or food processor and process just until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and bring to a boil over moderate heat. (If you don?t have a food processor, cook the soybean mixture first, then beat with a whisk.) Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon, about 5 minutes. Add a little water if it?s too thick. Set aside to cool. To serve, transfer to individual sauce bowls and garnish each with cl paste and chopped peanuts. This sauce will keep up to 2 weeks if refrigerated in a tight-lidded jar. Cook?s Note: To cook bun, boil until the noodles are white and softened but still resilient, about 4 to 5 minutes, drain, rinse immediately in cold water and drain completely before serving. Place the peanuts on a cookie tray and bake in a preheated 325 degree F oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Halfway into the baking, gently shake the tray so the peanuts roast evenly. (You can also roast the peanuts in a dry pan over low heat). Remove and set aside. Use the peanuts whole or coarsely chop them with a mortar and pestle, a food processor or a knife. Yield: 1 cup &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 33638,&quot;Deep Dish Cherry Pie with Hazelnut Crust 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 eggs 3 1/4 cups flour 1/2 cup finely ground peeled and toasted hazelnuts 2 1/2 pounds fresh or thawed frozen cherries or 2 (16-ounce) cans pie cherries 6 tablespoons cornstarch 1 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger, optional 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 6 large ramekins or oven proof individual baking dishes, 8 to 12-ounce capacity Rolling pin Large round cutter, (diameter of outside of ramekins, can use ramekins as guide) Instructions: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter until smooth. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix. Add the eggs and mix. Add the flour and mix until almost incorporated. Add the hazelnuts and mix just until smooth, being careful not to over mix the dough. Form the dough into 2 disks and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill at least 2 hours or overnight. If the dough is refrigerated overnight, remove it from the refrigerator 30 minutes before using. Roll out both disks, cut them out a little bigger than the size of your individual baking dishes, and chill while you make the filling. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Drain the cherry juices into a medium saucepan; you should have about a cup of juice. Add the cornstarch, sugar, ginger, if using, and lemon juice, and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the cornstarch. When thickened, turn off the heat, stir in the cherries, and set aside to cool slightly. Divide the cherry filling among the baking dishes. Carefully place the rolled-out crusts on top. To decorate them, brush the surface of the crust with milk, sprinkle lightly with sugar and use a sharp small knife to make a cross hatching pattern, cutting one vent hole in the center. You may also cut out strips from the leftover dough, and make designs or cherries from it, and adhere them to the top with a little water. Then wash with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Place the pies on a sheet pan to catch any juices that boil over. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling at the vents, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 33639,&quot;My Version of My Friend Jon&#39;s Polish Stir-Fry and Pierogis Pot Stickers with Herbs and Sour Cream 3 tablespoons softened butter 1 package frozen pierogis, potato filled dumplings -- any brand or variety 1 1/2 pounds kielbasa, cut in large slices on an angle 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan 1 tablespoon butter 1 large red onion, quartered and sliced 1 1/2 pounds kale, trimmed and coarsely chopped 1 pound sauerkraut, drained 1 teaspoon ground mustard or 2 tablespoons prepared spicy brown mustard 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, 1/3 palm full Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or 2 teaspoons dried dill leaves 2 tablespoons chopped chives A handful of parsley leaves, chopped 1 cup sour cream Instructions: Cover the bottom of a skillet with softened butter.

Add the fish and make sure each piece is coated with the marinade. For the mayo: Put the mayonnaise, garlic, mint, cumin, and lime juice in a food processor. Whizz until smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and more lime juice, if necessary. Pour into a bowl and set aside. Grab a large, nonstick saute pan and warm it gently over medium heat; no need to add oil since the fish is already coated in oil. Once warm (test by sprinkling some water into the pan, if it sizzles and evaporates, you&#39;re ready), place each piece of fish in the pan. It should sizzle gently but firmly when it hits the pan. Cook until cooked through, but still moist, about 3 minutes per side. The fish should flake easily with a fork. Don&#39;t overcook your fish! It&#39;ll taste awful! Remove the fish from the pan and serve immediately with warmed tortillas. I put a light layer of cabbage on the bottom, then the sauce, a few chunks of fish, the scallions, a couple of slices of banana pepper, and a squeeze of lime. And once the fish is finished off, you can do what I do, and make cabbage tacos - everything except the fish!

Add the grits, stirring with a fork to prevent any lumps from forming. Once the grits have started to thicken, reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. For the tomato gravy: Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the grape tomatoes, sugar and garlic and cook until the tomatoes start to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter; let melt. Stir in flour and cook until starting to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the broth, tomato paste, salt and pepper until smooth. Continue cooking until the mixture comes to a boil; it will thicken as it heats. When thick like a gravy, remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Serve the warm grits in shallow bowls, topped with tomato gravy and collard greens. Prepare the collards for cooking by cutting the large stems from the center of the leaves. Stack the leaves and cut them crosswise into 1-inch strips Put 2 inches of water in a saucepan large enough to hold the raw collards (the leaves can be pushed down tightly and will wilt to about one-quarter volume as they cook). Add the ham hock or pork and bring the water to a boil. Add the collards and toss with tongs until the water returns to a boil and the leaves wilt down into the pan. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer over low heat for 1 hour, or until tender. Stir occasionally, checking to be sure there is enough liquid to prevent scorching. Taste the liquid and add salt if needed.

Meanwhile, place a large sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Using a large sifter, sift a pound of confectioners&#39; sugar onto the parchment. This helps prevent clumping, and makes the mixing easier. Lower the speed of the mixer, and, using the parchment as a funnel, pour the sugar into the bowl and mix slowly until combined. Add the milk and mix until combined. Sift the second pound of sugar onto the parchment sheet. Again at low speed, add the sugar and mix well. Once combined, sift the remaining sugar and add it with the vanilla and mix. Once it is combined, turn the mixer speed up and beat the icing until very light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. If desired, divide the icing into smaller batches and color with food coloring. Spread the icing on cooled cupcakes while at room temperature. Refrigerate any leftover icing, but be sure to let it come back to room temperature before using. Re-whip the icing to make it fluffy again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 33685,&quot;Ranch Style Eggs with Chorizo and Tomato-Red cl Sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small red onion, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 cup dry red wine 2 1/2 cups canned plum tomatoes and their juices, pureed until smooth and strained 1/2 cup water 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder 2 tablespoons chipotle in adobo puree 1 tablespoon pasilla cl powder 2 tablespoons honey Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice Canola oil 4 (6-inch) yellow or white corn tortillas Salt 1/2 pound Spanish-style chorizo, diced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons 4 large eggs Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup crema Finely grated zest of 1 lime Tomato-Red cl Sauce Fried Tortillas Fried eggs 3/4 cup coarsely grated white cheddar cheese Chorizo Chopped cilantro Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over high heat.

Set a large pot of water over high heat. Add enough salt to make the water taste like the ocean (that&#39;s usually about 1/4 cup). When the water comes to a boil, pour in the pasta. Stir it continuously for the first minute. Cook the pasta according to the directions on the package. Each gluten-free pasta cooks differently. You are looking to cook the pasta until it has softened but still has a good bite. That&#39;s usually around 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Set up the sauce. Spread the Cheddar over the bottom of a large bowl. Dot the top of the Cheddar with the goat cheese. Toss in the kale leaves.<br> Finish the dish. When the pasta is cooked al dente, use a slotted spoon to transfer it to the bowl, on top of the cheeses and kale. Transfer about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water as well to the bowl. Do not stir. Let it sit for 5 minutes.<br> After 5 minutes, stir up the cheeses and pasta. You should have a good, creamy sauce. If it&#39;s not quite creamy enough yet, add a few more tablespoons of pasta water.

Remove from the oven to a large bowl and reserve. Coat a large saute pan generously with olive oil. The oil should be about 1/8-inch deep. Heat the pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the capers. As the capers cook they will open up and start to look like little flowers (very cute). Fry the capers until they are crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the capers from the pan, dry them on paper towels and season with salt immediately. Toss together the cauliflower, capers, radicchio, pecorino, and chives.

Halve the acorn squashes widthwise and scoop out the seeds and any loose fibers. Discard the fibers and reserve the seeds for garnish, if desired. Set aside the bottom halves of the squash as these will be soup bowls. Cut the top halves of acorn squash into large chunks and place on a baking sheet along with the apples and onions. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over the veggies, tossing to coat. Sprinkle with the thyme and some salt and pepper, and then scatter the sage leaves on top. Roast until dark golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let the squash cool slightly, and then peel off the skin. Blend the squash chunks with the apples and onions in a blender until smooth, adding broth until desired consistency is reached. Pour into a saucepan and keep warm over low heat until ready to serve. If using the squash seeds as a garnish, turn the oven temperature down to 325 degrees F. Place the squash seeds on a baking sheet, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake until crispy, about 25 minutes. Remove and let cool for 10 minutes before using. To make the squash bowls, slice about 1/2 inch from the bottom of each squash half so they will stay upright and not wobble around, spilling hot soup all over your guests. Place the squash in shallow bowls and fill with hot soup.

Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat, add the tea bags and let steep for 5 minutes. Discard the bags, pour the hot tea into a liquid measuring cup and let cool for 10 minutes at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Let the tea chill in the refrigerator while you grill the lemons. Slice one of the lemon halves into 4 thin rounds. Place the remaining halves flesh-side down on the grill pan, and cook until the flesh is deeply charred, about 5 minutes, rotating the lemons as needed so they char evenly. Place the sliced rounds on the grill, and char on both sides, about 3 minutes total. Transfer the lemon halves to a plate, and let cool for at least 10 minutes. (You will be squeezing them, so they should be cool enough to handle.) Reserve the charred rounds for garnish. Squeeze the cooled lemon halves into a medium bowl or a liquid measuring cup (you should have about 1 cup of juice). Whisk in the honey and 1 cup cold water. To serve, fill 4 tall glasses with ice. Divide the lemonade mixture equally among them. Stir 1/2 to 1 ounce bourbon into each glass. Slowly pour 1/4 of the chilled tea into each glass-it should float on top of the lemonade, making a two-layer drink. Garnish each glass with a charred lemon slice, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33698,&quot;Pecan Candied Bacon Bites 1/2 pound thick cut bacon 1/2 cup chopped pecans 1/2 cup brown sugar Freshly ground black pepper 4 slices rye bread 1/2 cup cream cheese, softened 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons chopped chives, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in 2 tablespoons of the oil. When the foam subsides, add half the crab cakes and cook over moderate heat until golden and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain the crab cakes on paper towels, then keep warm in a low oven. Repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil and cook the remaining crab cakes. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33701,&quot;Cauliflower Steaks with Kalamata Olive and Red Pepper Tapenade 1 cup Kalamata olives, pitted 1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, drained 2 tablespoons golden raisins<br> 1 tablespoon capers, drained and rinsed<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br> 1 teaspoon orange zest<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 medium heads cauliflower 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> Pinch red pepper flakes<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the tapenade: In a food processor, combine the olives, red peppers, raisins, capers, parsley, orange zest, tarragon and black pepper. Pulse six or seven times, just until roughly chopped. Pour in the olive oil and pulse 2 or 3 times to incorporate; the mixture should have the consistency of a coarse puree. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. For the cauliflower steaks: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat. Remove the green outer leaves from the cauliflower heads, leaving the cores intact. Set the cauliflowers on their base and halve them vertically (a serrated knife works well for this). Then slice each half, vertically again, into 1-inch steaks; the core will hold them together. You should end up with four nice steaks; reserve the ends for another use. Generously coat the steaks on both sides with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the steaks for 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and well-marked. Remove to a foil-lined baking sheet. In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan, panko, parsley, garlic and pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the breading on top of the cauliflower steaks and drizzle with some olive oil. Transfer to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve the steaks topped with spoonfuls of the tapenade. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 33702,&quot;Salt-Crusted Prime Rib with Star Anise-Shiitake Meat Jus 1 cup Fleur de sel or gros sel 1 tablespoon ground black peppercorn 1 tablespoon ground white peppercorn 1 tablespoon ground green peppercorn Canola oil to cook and rub on prime rib 1 10-15 pound prime rib, off the bone 4 sliced shallots 1 cup sliced shiitakes 2 cups dry red wine 4 cups veal stock and beef bouillon 3 each star anise 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce 1 tablespoon minced thyme 1 tablespoon butter Instructions: Pre-heat large, roasting pan in a 550 degree oven. Rub meat with oil. Mix the ground peppers and salt together. Generously coat the meat, patting the mix in. (This should be done at least 4 hours in advance, preferably overnight). Place in heavy roasting pan and in oven and roast until brown, about 30 minutes. Turn oven down to 325 degrees, cover the meat with foil to prevent burning and roast, 2-3 hours, depending on weight. I shoot for medium rare, about 130 degrees. Let meat rest on a cutting board for 15-20 minutes before slicing. Place roasting pan on high heat on the stove. Add shallots and mushrooms to brown, about 5 minutes. Deglaze with wine and scrape off drippings and reduce by 75%. Add stock, star anise, soy sauce, thyme and simmer for 20-30 minutes, about 50% reduction. Check for seasoning. Remove star anise and transfer to a blender. Blend and add butter and check for flavor.

Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together, add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe, or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax. Work the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square, and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and, keeping it square shaped, use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter, completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added, the dough is referred to as a paton. The paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds, allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin, use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold, or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times, make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and give it the final two folds, starting each time with the 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour before using. Then it will be ready to be rolled and formed into the shape required. The finished puff pastry will keep, well wrapped in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for one day or in freezer for up to two months. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color, about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens, release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture. Using a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide, cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled. For the Chocolate Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating, use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil, continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean. If you would like to add butter, this is the time to do so. Add the bittersweet chocolate and stir until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean, airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of it to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, until ready to use. For the Pate a Choux: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the water, salt, sugar, and butter into a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the bread flour all at once, and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spatula. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, move the paste from side to side in the saucepan with the wooden spoon. Turn it over onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, allowing it to dry, however, keeping it moving all the while or it will burn. You will know the paste is dry enough when it begins to leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. This will prevent the eggs from cooking and scrambling when combined with the paste. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs one at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated, which is okay. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth and homogenous again. The number of eggs you will wind up using will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 4 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about one foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes about 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in one big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated. If necessary, add one more egg. If the pate a choux is too dry, it will not pipe well. If it is too wet, it will be loose and runny, and won&#39;t hold its shape. Place the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch straight tip. Pipe the batter into 1 1/2-inch mounds on a parchment lined sheetpan about 1 1/2 inches apart as they will spread slightly when baked. Using the same plate as a guide from the puff pastry, trace a ring onto a piece of parchment paper. Flip the paper over and pipe a ring of choux batter along the line that is about 1 1/2 inches wide. Bake the choux for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until golden brown and dry on the inside, about 15 minutes more. To help the choux dry, you can open the oven door during the last 5 minutes of baking to let out the steam. For the Caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until light golden brown. When the desired color is reached, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-size glass bowl. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown, whereas a glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar. To assemble the St. Honore, divide the chocolate pastry cream in half. Reserving a small amount of whipped cream for decoration, mix the rest with one half of the pastry cream creating a lightened version. Dab the bottom of the choux ring with the caramel and set on the puff pastry circle. Cut 4 puffs in half and using caramel, glue the puff bottoms to the top of the ring, spacing them equally. Dip the tops of the puffs in caramel and set aside. Pipe the chocolate pastry cream into a mound in the center of the ring. Using a star tip, cover the mound with lightened chocolate pastry cream in straight lines, starting at the center and moving outward. Pipe the lightened chocolate pastry cream into each puff bottom. Place the puff tops on the filled puff bottoms. Place one more caramel-dipped puff at the top of the dessert. Decorate with whipped cream by making rosettes or trails of whipped cream from top to bottom. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33709,&quot;Mediterranean Bean and Bacon Soup 3 tablespoons EVOO, plus more for drizzling 5 ounces pancetta, finely diced 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated 2 to 3 small stalks celery, finely diced 2 medium carrots, finely diced 1 large fresh bay leaf 1 onion, finely diced<br> Herb bundle of fresh parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme tied with kitchen string Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1/2 cup dry white wine 6 cups chicken stock Two 15-ounce cans cannellini beans<br> 1 small bunch Tuscan kale, stems and ribs removed and leaves finely shredded or chopped Freshly grated nutmeg 1 rind from a wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano Shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving Crusty bread, for serving Instructions: Heat the EVOO in a Dutch oven or medium soup pot over medium-high heat.

Set the can directly on top and fill the saucepan with enough water to reach 2 to 3 inches over the can. Bring the pot to a full boil, then lower to a simmer. Cook for 3 to 4 hours, checking the water every 30 minutes. Don&#39;t let the water level get below the can or evaporate completely. You will destroy the pot and not have properly cooked dulce de leche. I like a darker, more caramelized cream, so I cook it for 4 hours (though 3 hours will work). Very carefully remove the hot can from the pot with tongs. Allow the can to cool for 24 hours at room temperature before opening. Store in the refrigerator for up to one week after opening.<br> For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the hazelnuts in a single layer on a sheet pan and bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.

Roll out to an 11- to- 12-inch round. The dough should be slightly thinner than 1/4 inch. Chill that piece and repeat with the second disk. Chill both rounds of dough until very firm (the freezer can help if time is important).<br> Line two sheet pans with parchment; set aside. From one round of dough, cut out twenty-eight 2 1/2-inch cookies. I like to use a square cutter just to mix it up from the traditional round cookie. Cut out cookies from the second round of dough-these will become the tops of the cookies. You will need to cut out a small 1-inch round center hole from the second set of cookies, which will allow you to see the filling of the finished cookie. Bake the punched holes for snacking on.<br> Once all the cookies are cut, arrange on the prepared pans and chill until cold or overnight.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the cookies until they&#39;re light golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature.<br> Top the bottom cookies with the dulce de leche or your favorite fruit jam or jelly. I love cranberry-orange jam. Sift confectioners&#39; sugar on the cookie tops while on the sheet pan, then place on top of the filled bottom cookies; light press together.<br> The filled cookies should be eaten the same day.

Remove the chicken and carefully shake it to ensure that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan. Return to the oven to roast, 20 more minutes. Baste the chicken and continue to roast, basting every 5 minutes, for 30 minutes. Add the carrots, garlic and onions and continue to roast until the chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh (avoiding bone) reads 155 degrees F, about 20 minutes more. Place the chicken on a cutting board with the vegetables. Skim the fat from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons. Place the pan over a burner and add the flour. Cook until browned, then add the wine. Scrape out all the pan juices and the wine-flour mixture into a small saucepan. Cook for 3 minutes, then add the cream and remaining 2 tablespoons butter, whisking. Season with salt and pepper.

Beat the butter with a handheld mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, add the granulated sugar, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt and continue beating until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl again if needed, then add the egg mixture and beat for about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer to low speed and add the flour in batches, mixing just until blended. Divide the dough in half and place each half between 2 pieces of waxed paper or lightly floured parchment. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into disks about 1/4 inch thick. Slide the covered disks onto a flat cookie sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours or overnight. Position the oven racks with even space all around and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1 disk of the cookie dough on a clean work surface and peel off the top sheet of paper. Cut out cookies with a 1 1/2-inch round or decorative-shape cookie cutter directly on the parchment. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to a prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1-inch apart. Repeat with other disk of dough. Any excess dough can be re-rolled, refrigerated and cut. Bake until the edges of the cookies are light golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool. For the icing: In a small bowl, whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar with just enough milk to make a thick icing. Tint the icing with food coloring if desired. Transfer the icing to a small plastic bag. Press the icing into a corner of the bag and snip off the corner with scissors to make a small opening. Gently squeeze the icing onto the cookies as desired. Top with sprinkles, candies or colored sugar if using. Set aside for about 1 hour to let the icing harden.
