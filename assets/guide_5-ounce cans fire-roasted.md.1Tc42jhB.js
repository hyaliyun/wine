Refrigerate 12 to 24 hours before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71177,&quot;Bai Qie Ji (White Cut Chicken) 3 tablespoons kosher salt 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and sliced into 5 coins 1 scallion, cut in half One 3- to 4-pound organic whole chicken, at room temperature and trimmed of any excess fat Scallion-Ginger Sauce, recipe follows, or soy sauce, for serving 3 tablespoons finely chopped ginger 2 scallions, trimmed, white and green parts finely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons) Kosher salt 1/4 cup neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar Freshly ground white pepper Instructions: Bring 4 quarts of cold water to a boil in a 7-quart Dutch oven. Add the salt, ginger and scallion. Slowly lower the chicken into the boiling water with the breast side up. Bring the water back up to a gentle boil. Carefully lift the chicken out using the handles of 2 wooden spoons or 2 pairs of chopsticks positioned under the wings, being careful not to tear the skin, so that all the water drains from the cavity; do not use tongs to lift the chicken as they can easily tear the skin. This step allows for any cold water still in the cavity to drain and ensures even cooking, inside and out. Lower the chicken back into the water. Bring the water back up to a boil and reduce the heat to low for a gentle simmer. Cook, covered, until the juices run clear when cut in between the leg and thigh, 33 to 35 minutes. Right before the chicken is done, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Transfer the chicken to the bowl of ice water breast-side down and let cool, flipping halfway through, for about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken, letting the excess water drip off. (Submerging the chicken in an ice bath, not only stops the cooking so that it doesn&#39;t overcook, but also helps to firm the meat and gives the skin a crispness that couldn&#39;t be achieved otherwise.)<br> Carve the chicken using a meat cleaver or large heavy chef&#39;s knife: start by detaching both leg quarters (leg and thigh together) from the body. Chop the leg quarters into roughly 3/4-inch pieces. Place the leg pieces in the lower half of the plate. Cut off the wings and drumettes and place right above the leg pieces. Cut the breastbone in half and remove the spine. Chop the breast into 3/4- to 1-inch pieces starting at the tapered end; transfer the breast pieces to the plate on top of the leg pieces.<br> Serve with a small bowl of Scallion-Ginger Sauce for dipping or plain soy sauce.<br> Stir together the ginger, scallions and 1 teaspoon salt in a heatproof medium bowl. Heat the oil over high heat in a small pot until it just starts to smoke or registers 375 degrees F on a digital thermometer, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully pour the hot oil over the scallion-ginger mixture and stir to combine. Mix in the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon white pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71178,&quot;One-Pan Roast Chicken with Vegetables 6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs Kosher salt and black pepper<br> 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 1 pound baby Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch chunks 10 cloves garlic 10 pearl onions 7 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped, plus 6 sprigs 2 parsnips, peeled and sliced 1-inch thick 1 lemon, thinly sliced<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Make the shells: Fill a large Dutch oven with 2 inches of canola oil; heat to 360 degrees F. meanwhile, sift an even layer of flour onto a flat surface. Dust the dough with flour and roll out slightly. Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll out until about 1/8 inch thick. With a paring knife, cut out 3- to 4-inch rounds using a small bowl as a guide. You should have about 24 rounds total. Wrap each round of dough around a cannoli mold, brushing with a little beaten egg to seal the seam and ensure the dough won?t slide off the mild. Flare out the edges of the dough slightly (this lets the oil penetrate each shell as it fries). Working in small batches, hold one end of each mold and carefully add to hot oil. Fry the shells until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the shells from the oil using tongs and transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Let cool slightly. Using a kitchen towel, grip the mold in one hand and hold the shell in the other. Twist the shell slightly to pull it off the mold; set aside to cool. Repeat to make more shells. Fill the cannoli: Using a spatula, transfer the refrigerated filling to a pastry bag and snip the corner. Just before serving, pipe the filling into the shells from both sides so it runs through the whole shell. Dust the cannoli with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71190,&quot;Les Crepes d&#39;or 1 cup flour, sifted 1 egg 1 egg yolk 1 1/4 cups milk Freshly ground salt Freshly ground white pepper 3 tablespoons butter 6 tablespoons flour 2 cups chicken stock 2 large chicken breasts, boned Clarified butter 6 tablespoons dried tarragon Freshly ground salt, to taste Freshly ground white pepper, to taste 6 tablespoons grated cheese 4 slices prosciutto 3 teaspoons caviar (optional) 2 teaspoons chopped chives Instructions: For batter: Place flour in bowl.

Preparing the Vegetables Peel the carrots and cut them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch-long pieces. Cut the thicker pieces in half lengthwise as well. Peel each onion and cut into quarters. Wash the potatoes under cold water to get rid of any dirt. Leave them whole and unpeeled. Scatter the carrots, onions, and potatoes on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking or roasting pan. Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper over them, and lay 2 sprigs of the rosemary on top. If you are using dried rosemary, put 1 tablespoon in the palm of your hand and crumble it over the vegetables. Preparing the Chicken The giblets, which consist of the liver, gizzard, and heart, plus the neck, are usually in a package inside the cavity of the chicken, between the legs. Remove them and discard or refrigerate them to use later. If there is a pale-yellow chunk of fat on either side of the cavity, pull or cut it off and discard. Hold the chicken under cold running water and rinse it inside and out. Shake off excess water and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the remaining 11/2 teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper over the outside of the chicken, rubbing them all over the skin. Set the chicken, the breast side facing up, on top of some of the vegetables, with the remaining ones surrounding the bird. Insert a dial-type (not instant-read) thermometer into the breast, taking care that the rod of the thermometer does not touch any bones. Roasting the Chicken Put the chicken in the center of the oven and set the timer for 30 minutes. When the timer rings, remove the pan from the oven and, using a large spoon, turn over the vegetables that surround the chicken. Don&#39;t bother with the vegetables under the chicken. Return the pan to the oven and set the timer for 30 more minutes. After 30 minutes, take the chicken out of the oven to check for doneness. Insert the tip of a small paring knife into the meat of the thigh where it attaches to the body. If the juices that run out are pink, the chicken needs to continue cooking for another 10 to 15 minutes. If the juices are clear, it is done. The meat thermometer should show a temperature of 170 degrees F to 180 degrees F when the chicken is done. Carving the Chicken Carve the chicken according to the instructions on the preceding page. Scoop the vegetables out of the roasting pan and onto a serving platter. Remove the fat from the pan juices. Arrange the cut chicken pieces on top of vegetables, spoon some pan juices over the chicken and vegetables, scatter the 2 remaining rosemary sprigs on top and bring the dish to the table for serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 71197,&quot;Paella with Prosciutto-Chicken Patty 1 pound ground chicken 1/3 pound Manchego cheese, grated<br> 1/4 cup ground prosciutto<br> 1/4 cup panko<br> 1 tablespoon smoked paprika<br> Salt and pepper to taste<br> 12 large shrimp, deveined 8 slices bacon<br> 6 cups chicken stock<br> 1 tablespoon achiote powder (ground annatto seed) 5 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 medium onion, chopped 1 green bell pepper, chopped 1 red bell pepper, chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced, plus 1 clove left whole 1 1/2 cups long-grain rice<br> Canned pimentos (do not drain), chopped<br> Lime wedges, for garnish Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the chicken, Manchego, prosciutto, panko, 1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika and salt and pepper to taste.

Place the almond paste and sugar in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the almond paste is softened and the sugar well incorporated, about 5 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and blend just until combined. Add the egg whites a little bit at a time, incorporating fully after each addition. Egg whites are difficult to pour in small amounts, so hold a rubber spatula against the rim of the bowl and use it to \\cut\\ the egg whites as they are poured. If you add the egg whites all at once, the mixture will be lumpy because the difference in consistency between the egg whites and the almond paste mixture is too great. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. You may or may not need all of the egg whites depending on the moistness and age of your almond paste. Stop mixing when the mixture reaches a consistency soft enough to pipe (like toothpaste). Place the batter in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 1-inch mounds onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. It will be easier if you hold the pastry bag at a slight angle and allow the tip to touch the parchment as you start to pipe. Once you have formed the mound, stop squeezing and lift the tip straight up, leaving a small tail on the top of each mound. Space the macarons about 1-inch apart to allow for spreading. Pipe carefully: Your macarons will look nicest when they are sandwiched together if they are all the same size. Immediately before placing them in the oven, liberally sprinkle granulated sugar over the macarons. This will give them a nice crust that will keep the inside moist and chewy. Bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. The top of each macaron should be very finely cracked, a characteristic for which they are known. If overbaked, the macarons will be dry and crunchy. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and immediately pour 1/4 cup of water onto the baking sheet under the parchment paper. Be careful: If you get any water on the macarons, they will be soggy. You will need to tilt the baking sheet to spread the water evenly. Let it sit for 2 minutes. The water will loosen the macarons from the paper. Remove the macarons from the paper 2 at a time and stick them together, matching the flat sides. Do not put them back on the hot, wet baking sheet or they will become soggy. The macarons can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or well wrapped in the freezer for up to 1 week. Unwrap them before bringing back to room temperature, or the condensation will make them soggy. &quot;,&quot;[Reds - Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 71224,&quot;Potato Rosti with Thyme and Garlic 2 ounces clarified butter (ghee) 2 cups grated peeled russet potato (from about 1 pound potatoes; use the large holes on a box grater) 6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped<br> 1 clove garlic, grated<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: In a 10-inch nonstick pan, heat the clarified butter over medium-high heat.

Add the butter and pulse until the dry ingredients and the butter are mostly combined. (If you do not have a food processor, this can be done with a pastry cutter.) Drizzle in the buttermilk and pulse (or stir in with a wooden spoon) until the mixture just forms a dough. Be careful not to overmix, as the biscuits will become tough when baked if you do. Using 2 large spoons, drop 1/4 cup-sized balls of dough on top of the tomato mixture.

Cook until reduced to 1/2 cup. Let cool to room temperature. Peel the tangerines, removing all the white pith, and segment over a bowl to catch both the segments and the juices. Cover and refrigerate until very cold. Combine the reduced juice, tarragon, egg yolk, and salt and pepper, to taste, in a blender and blend until well mixed. With the machine running, add the 1 cup olive oil, at first by drops and then, as mixture emulsifies, in a thin, steady stream until all the oil is incorporated. Taste, for seasoning. Scrape into a jar, cover, and refrigerate until needed. You should have about 1 2/3 cups mayonnaise. Keeps 2 to 3 days, refrigerated. Prepare the grill and let burn down to medium coals. Toss the cooled asparagus with about 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill over medium to low coals, turning the spears as needed, until they take on a little color and are just tender, about 6 minutes. Cover the grill, if necessary, to maintain the heat. Arrange the asparagus on a platter with the reserved tangerine segments. Dot with the mayonnaise, and drizzle with any tangerine juice left in the bowl. Garnish with fresh or candied zest and the nuts, if using. Serve at once. Cook&#39;s Note: Every cook has insecurities. One of mine is mayonnaise. I always get a little anxious until I see it coming together in the blender. If the mayonnaise is too thick, thin it, with the machine running, by pulsing in a little cool water. If you are concerned about raw eggs, use a pasteurized egg product or an egg substitute such as Egg Beaters. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 71233,&quot;Gobble-Bolognese Spaghetti 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 (14-ounce) package Del Monte?

When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Depending on the thickness of the chocolate, you may want to repeat this step to make the swan thicker. Unmold the chocolate swan. When the chocolate has completely set, the swans are ready to fill with candy. To mold the treasure chest: Use a clean paintbrush or pastry brush to apply dark chocolate to the inside details of the mold. I painted the hinges and fasteners dark chocolate. Use a ladle to fill a mold with milk chocolate. Use the same molding technique as used in the swan. You can fill the chest with candy or any special treat. Tie it closed with a ribbon. To make the picture and frame: This technique can be used to make any painted design. I downloaded a clipart image from the internet. A simple design with a lot of color makes the best result. Place your design underneath a piece of acetate. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to trace the outline of the painting with a dark-colored paint. Use other paint colors to fill in the design. This will certainly remind you of paint-by-number. Use and airbrush if you want to give it an antique finish. Allow the paint to dry. Pour some white chocolate at the edge of the painted acetate. Pull the raplette through the chocolate pulling the chocolate over the painted drawing. This will spread an even 1/8-inch thick layer of chocolate over the painting. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to cut the paint canvas to the finished size of the painting. Let this cool until the chocolate sets. When the chocolate has set completely, simply peel off the acetate. Use a brush dipped in dark chocolate to brush a very light layer of dark chocolate over the relief of the picture frame mold. Use a ladle or cornet filled with white chocolate to fill the mold with white chocolate. When the chocolate sets, unmold the picture frame. The dark chocolate will leave an antique effect. Use tempered white chocolate to glue the chocolate canvas into the frame. It is ready for display. Make the sleigh: Make a template for the sleigh skis and the sleigh bottom. You can make this any size that you like. The bottom of my sleigh measured 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. I used a wood grain tool normally used in house painting to give the sleigh the texture of wood. To make the wood grain chocolate, pour a little dark chocolate at the edge of a piece of parchment paper that measures at least 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. Use a back and forth rocking motion as you pull the wood grain tool through dark chocolate. Be sure to spread this chocolate all the way to the edge of the paper. Repeat the process until the paper is completely filled with the pattern. Repeat on more parchment to create enough wood grain pattern for all of the pieces in your sleigh. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over all of the pieces that have the dark chocolate wood grain pattern. When cutting out the skis, use a paring knife to cut through the chocolate while tracing around the template. When the chocolate has set completely, remove the excess chocolate. When the chocolate is set, peel off the parchment. Make the sleigh handle: Roll parchment paper into a tight roll that is about 1/2-inch in diameter. Use a cornet filled with milk chocolate to fill the roll. Be sure to pinch the bottom to keep the chocolate from escaping. Set aside until the roll has set. When the chocolate is hard, remove the parchment paper. Use a hot knife to cut the sleigh handle to the size that will fit onto your sleigh. Assemble: Lay a ski pattern-side down on the work surface. Place tempered milk chocolate in a large cornet and trim the tip. Draw a line of chocolate along the edge of the sleigh bottom. Position the sleigh bottom onto the ski. Draw a line of chocolate on the other edge of the sleigh and position the other ski on top. When the chocolate sets, stand the sleigh upright. Use tempered milk chocolate to glue the sleigh handle into place. The sleigh is ready for any display. Make the Dressy Gift box: To make the strips on the top, you can use a tiling spatula with square teeth cut from it. My box measured 7 inches wide by 10 inches long. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Pull the slotted spatula through the chocolate along the longest side. This will leave long straight lines. When the chocolate begins to set, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over strips, being careful not to press into the milk chocolate strips. Let the chocolate set completely. To make the base, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of parchment paper. Use a paring knife to cut a rectangle that measures 7 inches wide by 10 inches. Then cut 2 strips that measure 61/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Cut 2 more strips that measure 91/2 inches long and 11/2 inches wide. When the chocolate has set completely, remove the base and strips. Use tempered chocolate to glue the strips onto the base to form a box. Place the strips just inside the edge of the base. Make the box decorations: Use white modeling chocolate to make the tie, collar, pocket and pocket square. I colored some modeling chocolate red for the pocket square. Get creative and have fun. Dust the work surface with cornstarch. Use a rolling pin to roll out the white modeling chocolate until it is about 1/8-inch thick. Use a paring knife to cut out the details of the shirt or blouse. Place the pieces on top of the striped chocolate box top. If you are inspired to do so, paint some patterns on the tie. When the chocolate has set completely on all of the pieces, the box is ready to be filled with any treat. Simply fill the box and cover with the top piece.

Throw it in the microwave until the shortening is melted and hot, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir with a fork to combine thoroughly. Next, pour the melted chocolate over the underside of a clean cookie sheet. Then, with an offset spatula or a knife, spread the chocolate in a thin layer. Keep going until it&#39;s very, very thin. Then...and this is the key...stick it in the freezer for a few minutes. After a few minutes, check that the chocolate is ready by pressing it with your finger tip; it should leave the slightest mark, but not an actual depression. Next, get a somewhat sharp-edged spatula and begin to scrape the chocolate from the bottom of the pan. When the chocolate is just the right temperature, it&#39;ll curl instead of break. If it gets too soft, stick it back in the freezer for a minute. Pretty soon you&#39;ll have a bunch of fun little chocolate curls. Important: As soon as possible, transfer the curls to a cold pan or plate, and then stick them in the freezer to harden. Store in the freezer in a zip-top bag until you need them. Use them to adorn pies, cakes or platters of fruit.

Gently transfer sweetbreads to hot skillet and sear for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place the whole pan in the preheated oven to finish. Test for doneness after about 5 more minutes by touching the sweetbreads to see if the interior has \\tightened up\\ enough so it will remain intact when it is sliced. When this point has been reached remove from oven and let rest for about 20 minutes to allow all the flavors to flow back into the sweetbreads and allow it to set up before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71266,&quot;Eggplant Meatballs with Marinara Sauce 1 small eggplant (about 12 ounces) 1 large egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup cooked white beans, such as cannellini or navy (rinsed, if canned), smashed with a fork 1 large clove garlic, very finely chopped or pressed through a garlic press 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh basil leaves or flat-leaf parsley 1/2 cup finely grated parmesan cheese, plus extra for sprinkling (optional) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup whole-wheat panko-stylebreadcrumbs Olive oil mister or nonstick pan spray 2 cups marinara sauce (homemade or store-bought) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Using a food mill, grind the tomatoes into a bowl (or pulse in a food processor until coarsely pureed.) Season with sea salt and set aside. Very lightly dust a work surface with some flour. Fill a medium bowl with flour and spread it out into a wide even layer. Drop the dough onto the flour in the bowl, and flip it over once in the bowl to lightly coat it. On the work surface, using your fingertips, press the dough all over to flatten it. Flip it over and press all over the surface again. Flip it one more time and repeat. Press the dough with your fingers repeatedly on one side with one hand, and with the other hand, slowly turn the dough clockwise on the work surface. Continue poking and rotating the dough to flatten and stretch the dough. Pick the dough up and toss it back and forth between the palms of your hands until it begins to stretch, forms a rough disc, and gets thinner. Drape the dough over your hands, tuck your fingers in, and gently pull your knuckles toward the outer edge of the dough. Continue, rotating the dough as you go, until it is about 10 inches in diameter. Work slowly, allowing the weight of the dough itself to stretch and do not force it or it will tear and can make the crust too chewy. Dust the work surface with a little more flour and set the crust back down. Press it with your fingers and pull it gently at the edges to even out the circle. Using a small ladle, evenly spread about 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Scatter the mozzarella pieces from the center out, leaving space between the cheese. Tear the basil leaves in half and scatter the pieces over the pizza. Lightly flour a pizza peel and set it on the work surface at the edge of the pizza crust closest to you. Run your fingers around the outside parameter of the crust to loosen any edges that might be stuck (and make sure the dough is not stuck to the counter anywhere in the center). Gently grab the dough at the 5 o&#39;clock and 7 o&#39;clock positions and in one, quick motion, pull the pizza onto the peel. Use your fingers to pull and straighten the crust until round. Open the oven door. Set the front of the peel on the back edge of the pizza stone. Shake the peel very lightly to make sure the dough is not stuck and will slide. Holding the peel at a 45-degree angle, jiggle it until the pizza begins to slide off; once it reaches the edge of the peel, shake it lightly a few times, and then pull the peel out in one swift motion to drop the pizza onto the hot stone. Immediately close the oven door and cook until the crust begins to char on the bottom and edges and cheese is melted and bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Use the peel to remove the pizza; slide it onto a cutting board. Slice with a pizza wheel and serve immediately. Put the yeast in a measuring cup and dissolve it in about 1/2 cup of the water. In a large bowl, dissolve the salt in the remaining water. Add about 1/2 cup of the flour to the salt-water solution and add the yeast mixture. Use your fingers to mix well. Add the remaining flour and mix with your hands until it forms a dough. Transfer the dough to a floured countertop. To knead the dough, grab the sides with your fingers and pull it up and over itself into the center. Using the balls of your hands, press the dough firmly in the center. Repeat, pulling the dough from the outer sides inward, Press it fast from the edge inwards. Working quickly will help prevent it from sticking. Continue kneading the dough until it is very smooth to the touch, and springs back when pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a clean bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for 2 hours, and then divide into four 9-ounce portions. Form the portions into balls. Cover the dough with a towel and let rise at room temperature for 6 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 71314,&quot;Rum-Glazed Pineapple Coffee Cake 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of fine salt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more, for the pan 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup sour cream 2/3 cup pineapple preserves 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons dark rum Instructions: Put the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a small bowl and stir to combine. Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat together the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just incorporated. Spoon half of the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Dollop the pineapple preserves on top and carefully smooth with the spatula. Spoon the remaining cake batter on top and smooth the top. Sprinkle on the crumb topping. Bake until the cake and topping are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan 20 minutes, then invert onto a plate; invert back onto a rack to cool completely. When the cake is cool, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and rum in a medium bowl until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cake and let set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 71315,&quot;Fresh Pasta 3 cups durum semolina flour 1 teaspoon salt 2 to 3 eggs 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 cup grated Romano cheese Instructions: Mix the semolina and salt together. On a large work surface, form a mound with the semolina and create a \\well\\ in the center of the mound. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and oil together until smooth. Pour this mixture into the well. Working from the inside of the well out, gradually work the semolina into the eggs, until all the flour is worked in. Wrap with plastic and allow to rest for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and temper for 5 minutes. Flour a surface and turn the dough out onto it. Roll out the dough to 1/2 of an inch thick. Cut the dough out into thirds. Using a pasta machine, wide cutters, carefully work one piece of the pasta dough through the pasta machine. Lightly toss the cut pasta in flour to prevent from sticking. Pass the remaining pieces of pasta through the machine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 71316,&quot;Pork and Potatoes with Orange Juice and Cola 1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 1-inch cubes Salt 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 large Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 cup onion, cut in large dice 2 poblano chiles, seeded and cut into large dice 1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into large dice 2 cups fresh orange juice 2 cups cola Serving suggestion: Yellow rice and wilted fresh spinach leaves.

Add half of the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the remaining butter and pulse into pea-size pieces. Add 1/4 cup ice water and pulse until the dough clumps together but has not yet formed a ball. Turn out the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap; press into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling: Pulse 1/2 cup almonds, 1/4 cup sugar, the egg yolk, butter, vanilla and lemon zest in a food processor to make a paste. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Spread the almond filling over the dough, leaving a 2 1/2-inch border; top with the grapes. Fold the edge of the dough over the fruit by about 2 inches, pleating as needed. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes. Lightly beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Scatter the remaining 2 tablespoons almonds all over the galette, then sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the grapes are softened, about 40 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71325,&quot;Sweet Dried Fruit Compote 4 cups water, divided into 2 containers 8 ounces dried apples, pears and apricots 1/2 cup orange juice, freshly squeezed 4 ounces sugar, approximately 1/2 cup 1 lemon, zested 1 cinnamon stick 1 whole clove Instructions: Combine 2 cups of the water with the dried fruit in a large bowl.

Stir to blend and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and reduce for 3 to 4 minutes to allow the sugar and other ingredients to blend together. For the apples: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a baking dish large enough to hold all of the apples, arrange the apples in a single layer. Put a cinnamon stick inside the cavity made from coring each apple. Pour the glaze over the apples and top each with pieces of butter. Add the cider to the bottom of the dish and place it in the center of the oven. Cook the apples, basting them from time to time, until they are tender but not mushy, 25 to 30 minutes (smaller apples will take less time). Serve with scoops of ice cream, sour cream, or just by themselves. They are also delicious leftover. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 71327,&quot;Blueberry Syrup 2 cups blueberries 2 cups sugar<br> 2 teaspoons lemon juice<br> Instructions: Add the blueberries, sugar, lemon juice and 1 cup water to a saucepan.

Spray a 24-well nonstick mini muffin pan generously with baking spray. Melt the unsweetened chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave. Remove from the microwave and stir in 8 mints until all melted. Let cool slightly. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream 1 stick of the butter with the sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time. With the mixer on low, slowly drizzle in the cooled chocolate mixture, mixing until combined. Add the flour and mix thoroughly. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, add the mint extract and mix again. Using a tablespoon or small cookie scoop, scoop the batter into the prepared mini muffin pan. Bake until the edges are set and a toothpick comes out clean, 11 to 15 minutes. Let rest in the pan 5 minutes and then turn upside down out of the pan and allow to cool. Combine 30 to 36 mints in a microwave-safe bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the bittersweet chocolate. Microwave and stir until melted and smooth. Dip the brownie bites in the chocolate, concentrating on the top \\cone\\ part. Allow to set for a few minutes. Chop the remaining mints and sprinkle them on the top.

Yum! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71330,&quot;Roasted Brussels Sprouts 1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts 3 tablespoons good olive oil 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut off the brown ends of the Brussels sprouts and pull off any yellow outer leaves. Mix them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt and pepper. Pour them on a sheet pan and roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Shake the pan from time to time to brown the sprouts evenly. Sprinkle with more kosher salt ( I like these salty like French fries), and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71331,&quot;Roasted Parsnip and Vanilla Chocolate Soup 2 pounds parsnips (about 4 or 5 large parsnips) 1/4 cup canola oil (2 tablespoons to brush on parsnips and 2 tablespoons to brush on bread for croutons) 8 tablespoons butter (1 stick or 1/2 cup) 1 large white onion, chopped 2 quarts chicken stock 1 whole vanilla bean, preferably Tahitian (sold 1 or two to a jar in the spice section of the store) or 1 tablespoon vanilla extract (preferably from real vanilla bean as opposed to artificial flavoring) Salt and pepper 1 loaf French bread 1 tablespoon canola oil 1/4 cup dark cocoa powder 1 cup vanilla white chocolate chips (recommended: Hershey&#39;s Premier White Chips) 1 cup heavy cream 1 fresh lemon or lime, halved crosswise (1/2 to squeeze into batch of soup and 1/2 to cut into wedges to serve to guests) 2 tablespoons minced fresh dill leaves Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Peel parsnips, and cut into 1-inch chunks, brush lightly with oil and place on a baking sheet lined with heavy duty aluminum foil (for easy cleanup). Roast until the parsnips begin to soften (as tested with a knife blade) and until the tips begin to turn golden brown. This takes about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for a few minutes while you start the other ingredients in the stockpot. (Leave oven on for toasting of croutons.) Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a large stockpot and gently saute the onion until translucent. (This takes about 10 minutes, but the more important thing is that they look translucent.) Add the chicken stock, slice open the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the pot and add along with the vanilla pod itself. Increase heat to medium, add the roasted parsnips, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper, cover and let cook until the parsnips are completely tender, about 20 minutes. Once you have the soup underway, toast the croutons in the oven which is already preheated to 400 degrees F. Cut the epee loaf into 3/4-inch thick slices. Brush the bread with oil and place on a foil lined baking sheet (important for cleanup purposes). Sift dark cocoa over the bread and toast briefly in the oven, just to make crispy. Remove and set aside. Stir the white chocolate chips into the soup and cook for a further 5 minutes, to allow them to melt and to integrate flavors. Remove soup from heat, discard vanilla pod, and stir in heavy cream. Using an immersion blender, blend until smooth. (Remember, when using an immersion blender, the blade end has to be immersed, or it will make a big mess.) Squeeze fresh lemon or lime juice into the pot and stir to combine. (Note: If you hold the sliced end of the fresh lemon or lime against your palm while you squeeze in the juice, the seeds are likely to stay in the rind.) Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with fresh dill. Serve with lemon wedges and dark chocolate dusted croutons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 71332,&quot;Miso Marinated Blackened Cod 3/4 cup white miso 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 sake 6 tablespoons mirin 6 to 8 black cod fillets or fillet pieces Instructions: Over a double boiler, combine miso, sugar, sake, and mirin and whisk until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let cool. Refrigerate for a few hours so that marinade is cold and add black cod fillets or fillet pieces. Marinate for 24 to 48 hours in refrigerator. Remove from marinade and scrape off most of marinade that is coating the fish. Preheat oven to broil (oven should be very hot and heat should be coming from the top down). Place fish on a greased foil-lined baking sheet. Place baking sheet approximately 6 inches away from top heating element. Broil 7 to 10 minutes, until browned. Depending on the thickness of the fish, fish should flake away; otherwise, bake an additional few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 71333,&quot;Raspberry Stracciatelle Ice Cream 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup whole milk 1 cup granulated sugar 7 large egg yolks 1 1/2 cups raspberry puree, best quality 8 ounces melted white chocolate Instructions: Bring cream and milk to a simmer in a medium saucepan.

Using a mandoline or sharp knife, slice the mushrooms very thin. Put them in a serving bowl and toss with about 2 teaspoons of the olive oil mixture. Chop enough of the fennel fronds to make about 2 tablespoons (reserve the rest for another use). Trim the tops and bottoms from the fennel bulbs and halve the bulbs; slice off most of the core (leaving on a bit helps keep the bulb intact). Using the mandoline, shave the fennel bulbs almost paper thin from the root to the top end right over the mushrooms. Add the fennel fronds and the lemon zest; season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Shave the Parmesan over the salad using a vegetable peeler. Drizzle the remaining olive oil mixture around the edge of the bowl and toss everything gently but well to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Brunello di Montalcino, Barolo, Rioja, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 71335,&quot;Omelet with Fines Herbes 3 eggs, lightly beaten, room temperature 1 teaspoon tepid water 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Hot sauce, to taste Worcestershire sauce, to taste 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon washed, dried and chopped parsley leaves 1 small bunch chives, minced 1 tablespoon washed, dried and chopped tarragon leaves Buttered toast slices Instructions: In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, water, salt, a couple of dashes of hot sauce and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Whisk only enough to integrate the eggs. You dont want to whip too much air into them or make them frothy. Put the skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Swirl the butter around as it melts so it coats the whole surface of the pan. When the butter is melted (but not browned), lower the heat and pour in the egg mixture. Use a fork to stir the eggs slightly, as if you were scrambling them. Then, allow the eggs to cook, undisturbed for about 15 to 30 seconds. Sprinkle the herbs over the eggs.<br> Lift the handle of the pan up tilting the pan away from you and towards the heat. This tilting should cause the omelet to slide down in the pan a little. Fold the edge closest to you towards the center. Fold the other edge towards the center and tilt the pan over the center of a plate so it lands, seam side down. Serve immediately with buttered toast slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 71336,&quot;Pumpkin-Popcorn Soup 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 medium leeks (white and light green parts), thinly sliced and well rinsed 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped peeled fresh ginger 2 teaspoons curry powder 2 1/2 cups plain popped popcorn 1 quart chicken stock 1 cup canned pumpkin puree 1/2 cup heavy cream Juice of 1 lime (about 2 tablespoons) Kosher salt Instructions: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.

Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Thaw the pastry at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before gently unfolding. With a sharp knife, divide the pastry in half, wrap the remaining piece in plastic wrap, and return to the freezer for another use. Cut the pastry into 4 equal triangles. With the tip of a sharp knife, make a 1/4-inch score on all edges of the triangles, being careful not to cut all the way through. Put them on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops lightly with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. With the tip of a sharp knife, carefully remove the top of each pastry and set aside. In a skillet over medium heat, combine the butter and flour and cook, stirring slowly and constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, to make a blond-colored roux. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the broth and cook, whisking occasionally, until it thickens slightly, about 25 minutes. Season the crawfish with the Creole seasoning and add to the sauce. Cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream, Worcestershire, and hot sauce. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then stir in the green onions. Spoon equal amounts of the crawfish and sauce into the center of the pastries and top with the pastry tops. Serve warm. Mix all of the ingredients together and store in an airtight container.

Just before the mixture comes to a simmer, remove from the heat, stir in the berries and set aside for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors meld. Remove the vanilla bean before serving. Make the pancakes: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Whisk the flour, cornmeal, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and nutmeg in large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, eggs and oil. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry until just blended. Leaving a few lumps will result in fluffier pancakes. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add enough oil to grease it lightly and leave a film on the bottom of the pan. Working in batches, ladle the batter, about 1/2 cup at a time, into the pan. Cook until the pancakes are golden brown on the bottom and bubbles start to form on top, about 3 minutes, then flip and continue cooking another 2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter. Put the finished pancakes on a sheet tray and let sit in the oven to stay warm as you finish.

In the hot pan, sear the pork on both sides until there is a golden brown crust or good sear marks from the grill. Remove the pan from the heat.<br> In a small mixing bowl, combine the apples, Roquefort blue cheese, jalapeno peppers, and chives. Taste the mixture and season with salt, and pepper, to taste.<br> Lay the pork chops on a cutting board with the meaty side facing you. Using a paring knife cut a pocket into the pork, about 3/4 of the way through and work it open gently with your finger to make a pocket. Dividing the stuffing evenly among the chops, stuff the pocket with the stuffing and put a toothpick through the opening to help keep the stuffing inside the pork. Bake the pork in the oven for about 20 minutes, until the internal temperature is 125 degrees F. Remove from the oven and hold covered loosely with foil to let carry over to 135 degrees F internal temperature.<br> Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, combine the butter, shallots, and garlic. Turn on the heat to medium-high. Cook until the butter starts to turn brown. Add the blanched beans and toss until heated all the way through.

To make the Three-Onion Cherry Jam:<br> In a large saucepan, over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the yellow onion, red onion, and shallots to the pan and stir well. Season the onions with salt, and pepper, to taste.<br> When the onions have cooked down and they are deepening in color, deglaze the pan with the red wine. Let the wine cook until reduced and absorbed by the onions. Cook the onions for about 5 minutes more, then add the cherry juice and red wine vinegar. Reduce the heat to medium-low heat, and let cook at a slow simmer. Add the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Let the onions cook down until they start taking on a soft texture and the liquid is reduced and absorbed by the onions. Stir in 2 tablespoons brown sugar and honey. Cook, stirring occasionally until the liquid has reduced and the onions have absorbed most of the liquid, about 8 to 10 minutes. Taste the mixture and add more sugar if it is too tart. Test the consistency of the jam by drizzling a spoonful of it onto a plate and letting it cool. It should be thick and not runny. If it is too runny, simmer the mixture longer until more liquid is cooked out. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 71382,&quot;Southern Fried Chicken 1 whole frying chicken, cut into quarters Salt and pepper Paprika Cayenne 1 cup flour Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Season chicken pieces with salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne.

Cut the butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to the dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat the pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Occasionally reach down to the bottom of the bowl and mix all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter mixture. Stir in with a fork until the dough begins to hold together but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform.<br> To mix the dough in the food processor, combine the dry ingredients in the work bowl fitted with a metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut the butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to the work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal, and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all. Add the eggs to the work bowl and pulse 10 times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform.<br> Press the dough into two equal-sized disks. Sandwich the disks of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press them into 6-inch circles. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour.<br> To make the filling, combine 1 cup of the blueberries with the sugar in a non-reactive saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is very liquid -- about 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk the blueberry and sugar mixture into it. Return everything to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over low heat, until the mixture comes to a boil, thickens and becomes clear. If it does not become clear, continue to cook over low heat for a few more minutes, until it does. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the remaining filling ingredients, except the blueberries, then add the remaining 3 cups blueberries. Cool.<br> Set a rack at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in pan, or pans. Trim edge even with rim of pan. Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Roll remaining dough into a rectangle and cut 8 small strips to finish the top of each pie. Apply the strips, severing excess dough at edge of pans, 4 in each direction, diagonal to each other. If you wish, sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar.<br> Place the pie in the oven on the lower rack and reduce the temperature to 375 degrees. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is baked through and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently bubbling. If the top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30 minutes of baking, move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10 minutes. Cool the pie on a rack.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71389,&quot;Gordy&#39;s Coney Recipe 2 pounds 80/20 ground beef 2 tablespoons chili powder<br> 2 teaspoons salt<br> 2 teaspoons ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon paprika<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Oil, for frying 1 natural-casing wiener Yellow mustard, for topping 1 hot dog bun, heated Chopped onions, for garnish Instructions: For the coney sauce: In a large pan, brown the ground beef, then discard excess grease.

Cut the salmon into paper-thin slices. Reserve. Roll or stretch the dough into 4 (8-inch) circles. Place the pizzas on a lightly floured wooden peel. Brush the center of each pizza to within 1 inch of the edge with olive oil and sprinkle it with some of the red onion. Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake 8 to 12 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven. Mix the dill with the sour cream or creme fraiche and freshly ground pepper to taste. Transfer the pizzas to heated dinner plates and spread them with the sour cream mixture. Divide the salmon, and arrange decoratively over the cream. Place a spoonful of golden caviar in the center of each pizza, then spoon a little of the black caviar into the center of the golden caviar. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough. Yield: 4 (8-inch) pizzas &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 71415,&quot;Burnt Orange Negroni 1 orange 1 1/2 ounces gin, such as Bombay Sapphire 1 ounce sweet vermouth 1/2 ounce bitter orange liqueur, such as Aperol 1/2 ounce simple syrup 1/4 ounce lemon juice Dash bitters Ice Instructions: Char a whole orange on the grill and set aside to cool down.<br> Combine the gin, vermouth, liqueur, simple syrup, lemon juice and bitters in a mixing glass over ice.

Scrub and rinse the oysters. Keep refrigerated until ready to grill. To make the sauce: Pour the cream into a 1-quart saucepan and cook over low heat, whisking occasionally to prevent the cream from boiling over, until the volume is reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Increase the heat to medium and add the butter, 1 piece at a time, whisking constantly, until the sauce is shiny, emulsified, and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the lemon juice and simmer briefly. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the chervil or parsley and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Keep the sauce warm until ready to serve. Set up the oysters on the grill with the cup side down (and flat side up) or place them directly on the grill in the same fashion. Cook the oysters without turning them. As soon as the oysters pop open, after 8 to 10 minutes, transfer them carefully with tongs to a platter (or plates) lined with a bed rock salt. If you are using a Great Grate, this won&#39;t be necessary. Use the tongs to pry off the top shells. Spoon 1 teaspoon sauce over each oyster and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 71418,&quot;Pulled Pork Burritos 2 pounds Boston butt, bone out 2 tablespoons sea salt 1 tablespoon cayenne 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin 5 to 6 cups medium-dice mixed carrots, celery and red onions 5 to 6 cups medium-dice mixed carrots, celery and red onions<br> 4 cups chicken stock 3 1/4 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon annatto seed 2 cups rice 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 2 jalapenos, de-seeded and diced 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves, minced 1 tablespoon sea salt 1 1/2 teaspoons ground white pepper 1 lemon, halved 10 to 12 flour tortillas 2 cups black beans, cooked 2 cups shredded queso fresco or jack cheese 2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature Instructions: For the pork: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.

Then pat dry the pork and rub the exterior with the mixed seasonings. Once rubbed with the seasoning, place in a deep roasting pan. Add the cut vegetables and finish with the stock, then cover with foil. After covering, bake until softened, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. After roasting, remove from the oven, place the pork on a sheet pan and allow cooling. Skim any fat from the stock and reserve. After cooling, pull the meat for burritos, and then place the stock in a saucepot, warming over medium-high heat. Then puree with a stick blender to a create a sauce. Once pureed, taste and re-season if preferred. Then remove from the stovetop and place in a container to cool. For the rice: Place the stock in a saucepan and warm over high heat. Once hot, add the annatto seed and stir until dissolved. Then remove from the stove and pour over the raw rice in a 2-inch deep baking pan. Add the cilantro and jalapenos, cover with foil and place in the oven until cooked, about 30 minutes. All liquids should be absorbed for the rice to be cooked. For the burritos: To build the burritos, in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the pork and 1 cup reserved puree, stirring while warming for 4 to 5 minutes. Then add the cilantro, salt, pepper and lemon juice and warm. Then reduce the heat to low and keep the pork hot. Next, lay a tortilla flat and add in the center section 1 cup warmed pork, 1/4 cup rice, 2 tablespoons beans and 1 tablespoon cheese. Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla to meet, and then pull the sides over covering one another. Next, in a separate pan or on griddle, add 1 teaspoon reserved pork fat and heat over medium heat and allow to warm. Add the burrito and sear on the first side until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes, and then repeat on the second side until browned.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grate the zest from the lemons and orange, then cut the citrus fruit in half and reserve. Chop enough fennel fronds to measure 1 tablespoon. Put the butter in a bowl and add the citrus zest, chopped fennel fronds, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and mix to combine thoroughly. Slide your hands between the breast and skin of the turkey to carefully loosen the skin. Use your fingers to loosen the skin over the drumsticks and thighs as well. Rub all but about 1 or 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture all over the turkey under the skin. Rub the remaining butter mixture over the surface of the turkey. Season the turkey all over with salt and pepper. Squeeze the juice from 1 of the reserved orange halves and 2 of the lemon halves into the bottom of a large roasting pan and then insert all of the citrus halves (including the juiced ones), the fennel quarters and half of the thyme into the cavity of the turkey. Tie the turkey legs together with twine. Add the stock and remaining thyme to the bottom of the pan with the citrus juices. Position a roasting rack in the roasting pan and put the turkey on the rack. Roast, rotating the pan halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 160 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (If the turkey and wing tips are browning too quickly, lightly cover with foil and remove in the final 30 minutes of cooking.) Let the turkey rest for 30 minutes before carving. Using a ladle, carefully remove the pan juices from the bottom of the pan and pour into a fat-separating liquid measuring cup for the gravy. Allow to sit for 5 minutes so the fat rises to the top. For the gravy: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the thyme and shallots and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the flour and cook, whisking, until golden and nutty smelling, about 3 minutes. Add the Marsala wine and continue to whisk. Slowly pour in the stock and separated pan juices while mixing, making sure to incorporate the flour mixture as you go. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the sugar if needed to balance any bitterness from the citrus. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to eat, then strain into a gravy boat. Carve the turkey and place on a large serving platter. Garnish with fennel fronds. Serve with hot gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 71425,&quot;Eastside Fish Fry&#39;s Famous Chicken Gizzards 5 pounds chicken gizzards Ground black pepper<br> Seasoning salt<br> Eastside Fish Fry Famous House Seasoning, recipe follows Cooking oil, for frying Eastside Fish Fry Chicken Flour, recipe follows 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons salt 2 1/2 tablespoons corn flour 1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 tablespoons tapioca starch 3 teaspoons MSG 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon dried lemon peel 1 teaspoon citric acid 1 teaspoon navy bean flour 4 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups special fry mix, such as Drake&#39;s Crispy Fry Mix 1 1/4 tablespoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay<br> 1 1/4 tablespoon seasoning salt<br> 1 tablespoon garlic powder<br> 1 tablespoon ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Put the gizzards in a stockpot and cover with water by several inches.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Flour and roll the dough to 1/16 to 1/4-inch thick. Cut out 3-inch rounds. Paint with the egg wash. Drop 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each round. Fold over, then crimp with a fork, pressing closed from the outside-in. Cook in small batches until tender but nice and chewy (about 3 minutes). For the Butter Pecan Nic: Split the vanilla bean lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds. Reserve all. Put the seeds, pod halves, milk, cream and 1/4 cup brown sugar in a heavy-bottomed, medium saucepan. Bring to a scald over low heat. In the meantime, put the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, egg yolks and vanilla extract in a large bowl and whisk just to blend. While gently whisking the yolks, drizzle the hot cream mixture into them so that they are gradually warmed up. Return everything to the saucepan and cook while stirring with a wooden spoon.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the water, orange juice, oil and 2 of the eggs. Add the wet to the flour mixture; stir to combine. Knead, either by hand on a floured surface or with a dough hook on medium speed for 7 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary (but resist any urge to add too much!), until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours. (Alternatively, chill the dough in the refrigerator overnight, then let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before shaping.) Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Divide each into 3 logs and braid. Place on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper, spacing them evenly apart. Cover loosely and let rise 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining egg and 1 tablespoon water. Brush the loaves with egg wash and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake until they are golden and have an internal temperature of 190 degrees F; begin checking for doneness at 18 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly and enjoy.

Combine the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition until totally combined, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla and zest and mix to combine, about 30 seconds. Turn the mixer off, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula then add all of the flour mixture. Mix on low speed until everything is well combined, scraping down the sides again if necessary, making sure not to overmix. Cover and refrigerate until the dough is completely chilled, at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly flour a clean work surface. Scoop out 1 tablespoon of the dough and roll it into a rope, 5 to 6 inches long. Tie it into a loose knot and place on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. If the knots start to get warm, refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes. Bake on the upper and lower racks until the tops of the cookies are dry and set and the bottoms are golden, rotating the baking sheets front to back and switching rack positions, halfway through, about 15 minutes total. For the glaze and sprinkles: Meanwhile, whisk together the confectioners\\u2019 sugar, lemon juice, salt and 1 tablespoon of the milk in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon milk if needed\\u2014the glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream. Place the sprinkles in a small bowl. Once the cookies are cool enough to handle, dip the tops in the glaze, letting any excess run off, then dip in the sprinkles. Transfer the cookies, glazed-side up, to a wire rack and let cool completely. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71462,&quot;Seafood Gratin 1 cup seafood stock or clam juice 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons good white wine, such as Chablis, divided 3 tablespoons tomato puree 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 8 ounces raw shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cut in half crosswise 8 ounces raw halibut, cut into1-inch chunks 8 ounces cooked lobster meat, cut into 1-inch chunks 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 cups julienned leeks, white and light green parts (2 large) 1 1/2 cups julienned carrots (3 carrots) 1 cup panko (Japanese dried bread crumbs) 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon leaves 1 tablespoon minced garlic (2 cloves) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place 4 individual gratin dishes on sheet pans. (If recipe is doubled serve it in a 14 by 9 1/4-inch oval gratin dish.) Combine the stock, cream, 1/2 cup of the wine, the tomato puree, and saffron in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and add the shrimp. After 3 minutes, use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp to a bowl. Add the halibut to the stock for 3 minutes, until just cooked through, and remove to the same bowl. Add the cooked lobster to the bowl. Continue to cook the sauce until reduced by half, about 12 minutes. Mash 1 tablespoon of the butter together with the flour. Whisk the butter mixture into the sauce along with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saute pan. Add the leeks and carrots and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, until softened. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of wine, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until tender. Set aside. Combine the panko, Parmesan, parsley, tarragon, and garlic. Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and mix it into the crumbs until they&#39;re moistened. Divide the seafood among the 4 gratin dishes. Strew the vegetables on top of each dish. Pour the sauce equally over the seafood and vegetables and spoon the crumbs evenly on top. Bake for 20 minutes, until the top is browned and the sauce is bubbly. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 71463,&quot;House Dijon Mustard 2 cups organic yellow mustard seeds 2/3 cup champagne vinegar<br> 2/3 cup white wine, preferably chardonnay<br> Salt<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons organic garlic powder<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons raw cane sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon organic xanthan powder, optional Instructions: Put the mustard seeds in a sealable container and fill with filtered water 2 inches above the mustard seeds. Let the seeds soak and plump in the refrigerator for at least 3 days. Strain the liquid off and rinse under cold water in a mesh strainer. The seeds will have a fish egg texture; this is exactly what you want. Mix the mustard seeds, vinegar, wine, 2 1/2 tablespoons salt, the garlic powder and sugar together in a large bowl. Use a blender to blend the mustard, but only about a cup at a time for about 20 to 30 seconds each time (in order to get a good puree as well as save your blender motor). This first puree will not get the seeds broken down much, and the result will be a coarse-ground mustard that will need to sit another day to soak. Blend the mustard again the next day, and let it sit again for another day. On the third blend, you should find it is ready to use, although you can blend as many times as you want to get the texture you desire. For the adventurous, add the xanthan powder if desired to increase the textural balance. Taste and adjust the salt as needed to balance the vinegar. Use on your favorite sausage, or to make a wonderful vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 71464,&quot;Red Cabbage Slaw 2 cups shredded red cabbage 1/2 cup store-bought poppy seed dressing Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and toss to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 71465,&quot;Standing Rib Roast 1/2 bunch rosemary, leaves finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper Extra-virgin olive oil 1 8-to-8 1/2-pound bone-in standing rib roast Kosher salt 1 onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 pound baby carrots, tops trimmed 3 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 pound cremini mushrooms, stems removed, quartered 1 cup dry red wine 1 to 2 cups chicken stock 2 bay leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Toss with a little olive oil and salt to taste.Add the wine, 1 cup chicken stock and thebay leaves. Put the roast on top of the veggies; roast until the meat is really brown and lovely, about 45 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F; continue roasting, rotating the pan halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat reads 125 degrees F for medium rare or 130 degrees F for medium, another 2 hours 20 minutes. During the roasting time, occasionally spoon some of the pan juices over the meat. If the liquid level in the pan goes down too much, add the remaining 1 cup stock. Remove the roast from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Let rest 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Taste the veggies and season with salt, if needed. Skim off any excess fat from the pan juices and remove the bay leaves.

Line mini cupcake pans with 48 mini cupcake liners. Melt the chocolate in the boiling water. In a small mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy and stiff but not dry. Add 1/2 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter with remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and vanilla on medium speed until fluffy. Add the egg yolks and beat well. Blend in the melted chocolate. Sift together the rice flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the buttermilk to the chocolate mixture, beating after each addition until smooth. Fold in the Chocolate-Cardamom Ganache. Fold in the beaten whites. Fill the cupcake liners halfway and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. To assemble: When the cupcakes are cool to the touch, prepare a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Fill the bag with Chocolate Buttercream and pipe the tops of each mini cupcake, keeping the icing in low profile. Dust the top of the cupcakes with the cocoa powder. Place a Spun Sugar Bird&#39;s Nest on top of each cake. Carefully peel the Jewel-Encrusted Bird&#39;s Egg off the silicon mat. Place an egg inside each nest. Crush the cardamom in a spice grinder. Place the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Bring the cream and cardamom just to a simmer over medium-high heat; pour the mixture over the chocolate. Let stand, without stirring, until cool. Beginning near the center and working outward, stir the melted chocolate into the cream until the mixture is combined and smooth (do not over stir). In a medium bowl, beat the butter until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the melted chocolate and beat until smooth. Add the vanilla extract and beat for 3 minutes. Gradually add the sugar and beat until creamy and at desired consistency. Secure a long-handled wooden spoon under a heavy cutting board on the edge of counter, with the handle facing out and extending over the edge. Place newspaper on the floor directly under the cutting board. In a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar and corn syrup and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Stop stirring. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. Cook until the mixture turns pale amber and registers 340 degrees F (hard-crack stage) on the candy thermometer. Dip the prepared whisk into the caramel. Holding the whisk about 2 feet above the spoon handle, swing the caramel back and forth like a pendulum in long arcs, allowing the strands to fall in threads over the handle. Let stand until ready to use. Gently gather the strands into a ball, shaping nests with your fingers, about 1-inch in diameter. Heat the white chocolate over a double boiler until melted. Remove from the heat. When the chocolate begins to cool, transfer it to a pastry bag and tie off the top of the bag using a twist tie. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Cut a small slice off the end of the pastry bag (if the chocolate runs out to quickly let it sit a bit longer). Draw an oval egg no bigger than 1/4-inch. As soon as you draw the shape, sprinkle it with an assortment of the crystal sugars, layering them on top and next to one another. (Make it easy by putting the sugars into small ramekins so you can easily get to the desired color.) Place the eggs in the fridge to set up for a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 71472,&quot;Winter Crunch Salad with a Mind-Blowing Sauce A few young carrots, peeled and finely sliced A few small raw beets, peeled and finely sliced A few sticks celery, trimmed and thinly sliced, yellow leaves reserved 1/2 small Romanesco or white cauliflower, broken into florets 1 bulb fennel, trimmed and finely sliced, herby tops reserved 1 handful small beet leaves, if available, washed 1 bunch radishes, trimmed and washed 1/2 a celeriac, peeled and finely sliced 6 cloves garlic, peeled 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk 10 anchovy fillets in oil 2/3 cup good extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling 2 or 3 tablespoons good white wine vinegar Instructions: First, prepare all your vegetables, because once the sauce is done you&#39;ll be ready to serve!<br> To make your sauce, put the garlic cloves, milk and anchovies into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Simmer slowly for 10 minutes, or until the garlic is soft and tender, keeping a close eye on the pan to make sure the milk doesn&#39;t boil over. Don&#39;t worry if it splits and looks a little lumpy - simply remove from the heat and whiz the sauce up with an immersion blender. Gently blend in the extra-virgin olive oil and the vinegar a little at a time - you&#39;re in control of the consistency at this point. If you like it thick, like mayonnaise, keep blending. Now taste it and adjust the seasoning. Make sure there&#39;s enough acidity from the vinegar to act like a dressing. It should be an incredible, pungent warm sauce.<br> There are 2 ways you can serve this - with both you need the sauce to be warm. Either pour the sauce into a bowl and place this on a plate, with the vegetables arranged around the bowl, or serve the vegetables in a big bowl and drizzle the sauce over the top. Sprinkle over the reserved herby fennel tops and celery leaves and finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.<br> \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Turn the squash 180 degrees and repeat on the other side, splitting the squash. Scrape out the seeds with a spoon. Slice the squash into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Heat a 14-inch cast-iron pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Once heated, add the squash in an even layer. Season with salt and pepper and sear on the first side until lightly golden brown, about 3 minutes, in batches if needed. Place the seared squash on the prepared sheet tray, seared-side down, and season the top side with salt and pepper. Scatter the thyme sprigs over the squash and put into the oven. Roast until the edges are brown and the squash is tender in the middle, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer the squash to a large bowl, season with more salt, pepper and cumin to taste. Drizzle with the warmed syrup and toss to combine. Pour onto a platter and sprinkle with the pomegranate seeds and goat cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 71477,&quot;Blood Orange Ricotta Cake 2 cups whole frozen cranberries 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, strained 1/4 cup light corn syrup 1/2 cup granulated sugar 4 cups heavy cream Scant 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 pint fresh raspberries 2 teaspoons unsalted butter, melted but not hot 4 large eggs 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 3/4 cup grapeseed or vegetable oil 3/4 cup whole or skim-milk ricotta cheese 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed orange juice, strained 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup water 1/2 cup blood orange concentrate 1 gelatin sheet 2 cups cool water 4 large eggs 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup blood orange concentrate 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 2/3 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into 1/4-inch cubes Instructions: For the ricotta pound cake: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-3-inch round cake pan with removable bottom with the melted butter and line the bottom with a 9-inch-diameter parchment paper round. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip together the eggs and sugar at medium-high speed until the mixture is very thick and falls in heavy ribbons, about 7 minutes. In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, ricotta, orange juice, and vanilla. Gently add the ricotta mixture to the egg mixture and whip just until blended. Sift together the flour and baking powder. Add the sifted ingredients to the batter, mixing just until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Do not over mix. If necessary, finish folding in the sifted ingredients by hand, using a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and place on a rack in the center of the oven. Bake the cake until lightly browned on top, about 70 minutes. The cake is done when a knife blade inserted into the center comes out clean and when the top of the cake springs back lightly when touched. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely. Once cooled, remove the cake from the pan and peel parchment paper from bottom of the cake. Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap until ready to use. The Ricotta Pound Cake can be stored for up to 1 day at room temperature or in the freezer for up to 1 week. For the blood orange simple syrup: Combine the sugar with 1/3 cup water in a small, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, pour into a clean bowl, and allow to cool. Once fully cooled, stir in the blood orange concentrate until combined. The Blood Orange Simple Syrup will keep for up to 7 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the blood orange curd: Soften the gelatin sheet in 2 cups cool water for 3 minutes. Combine the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar and both juices into a heatproof, nonreactive mixing bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water) and whisk together until the sugar begins to dissolve. Cook, whisking continuously, until the mixture begins to thicken into a custard, 5 to 7 minutes. If using a candy thermometer, cook to 170 to 180 degrees F. Whisk the butter. The curd should be smooth and homogenous. Squeeze out the excess water from the gelatin and whisk the gelatin into the hot mixture until fully dissolved and combined. Remove the bowl from over the water and strain the curd through a medium-mesh sieve into a clean, nonreactive mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the curd and allow to cool in the refrigerator. The Blood Orange Curd can be stored for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the cranberry orange preserves: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the cranberries and orange juice. The cranberries should still be in chunky pieces. Combine the cranberry mixture with the corn syrup and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Stirring every 5 minutes, cook the mixture until it boils and thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. If using a candy thermometer, cook to approx. 210 degrees F. Transfer to a clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and cool in the refrigerator. The Cranberry Orange Preserves can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the blood orange whipped cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip together the cream and sugar until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the Blood Orange Curd until combined, being careful not to over mix, which could make the stiffened whipped cream weak. The Blood Orange Whipped Cream should be made when ready to assemble the cake. To assemble the cake: In a small mixing bowl, gently fold together the raspberries and the Cranberry Orange Preserves until combined. Place the unwrapped pound cake on a flat work surface. Using a long serrated knife, slice off the top 1/4-inch to even out the top of the cake as necessary. Slice the cake horizontally into 3 even layers. Using a 10-inch round cake board as the bottom of a 10-by-3-inch round cake pan with removable bottom, center 1 cake layer on the cake board, cut side up. Using a pastry brush, moisten the cake layer with one-third of the Blood Orange Simple Syrup. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of Blood Orange Whipped Cream and set aside to be used to frost the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula, spread half of the remaining Blood Orange Whipped Cream onto the syrup-soaked cake layer, allowing the whipped cream to fill up the space between the cake and the cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to gently but firmly press the whipped cream down in between the side of the cake pan and the cake layer, thus essentially forming the side of the cake. Spoon half of the raspberry-cranberry preserves mixture onto the Blood Orange Whipped Cream, gently pressing the berries onto the cream. Top with a second layer of pound cake and repeat with another one-third of the simple syrup, the other half of the remaining Blood Orange Whipped Cream, and remaining raspberry-cranberry preserves mixture. Top with the final layer of cake and moisten with the remaining Blood Orange Simple Syrup. Using a long, flat spatula, evenly spread the reserved 1 1/2 cups Blood Orange Whipped Cream over the top of the cake. Tightly wrap the cake in the pan in plastic wrap and place in the freezer overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Sangiovese, Beaujolais]&quot; 71478,&quot;Orzo Salad 4 cups chicken broth 1 1/2 cups orzo 1 (15-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed 1 1/2 cups red and yellow teardrop tomatoes or grape tomatoes, halved 3/4 cup finely chopped red onion 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves About 3/4 cup Red Wine Vinaigrette, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons honey 2 teaspoons salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Pour the broth into a heavy large saucepan.

Add the sugar to a food processor and blend until the sugar is super fine, about 1 minute. Reserve half (about 3/4 cup) of the sugar and set aside. Add the cake flour, the remaining sugar (about 3/4 cup), and the salt to a medium bowl. Sift into another medium bowl. Sift the mixture back into the original bowl. This helps get rid of any lumps and creates a very fluffy light texture in the cake. In a large bowl, add the orange zest, cream of tartar and egg whites. Slice the vanilla bean in half, scrape the seeds out with a knife, and add the seeds to the bowl with the egg whites. Using a hand mixer, begin to beat the egg white mixture on medium-high speed. While mixing, slowly stream in the remaining sugar. Beat the mixture until it holds medium peaks, this could take up to 10 minutes. Set the mixer aside and sift a light dusting of the flour mixture on top of the egg white mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold the flour into the egg white mixture, this is done by slicing through the middle of the mixture and folding up and over along the side of the bowl to incorporate the flour. Keep sifting and folding until all the flour mixture has been incorporated. Carefully spoon the mixture into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Use a knife to swirl around the pan 2 times to release any unwanted air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool upside down on a cooling rack. Let cool for at least 1 hour before removing the cake from the pan and cooling completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 71484,&quot;Choucroute Royale (Braised Sauerkraut) 2 pounds sauerkraut 1/2 pound chunk of bacon 1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots 1 1/2 cup sliced onions 4 tablespoon pork fat or butter 4 sprigs parsley 1 bay leaf 6 peppercorns 10 juniper berries (or add 1/4 cup gin to casserole) 1 cup sparkling wine 3 cups chicken stock Roast pork Pork chops Smoked pork loin Ham Sausages Duck Instructions: Drain the sauerkraut and soak in cold water for 15 to 20 minutes.

Butter three 8-inch round cake pans. Line the pans with parchment paper, then butter the parchment. Dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk together the all-purpose and cake flours, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg whites 1 at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with the milk and beginning and ending with the flour. Beat until just incorporated. Fold in the sprinkles. Divide the batter evenly among the pans and bake the cakes until golden at the edges and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the pans to wire racks and cool 15 minutes. Turn the cakes out of the pans and return to the racks to cool completely. For the frosting: While the cake layers are cooling, whisk together the sugar and egg whites in a heatproof mixing bowl set over (not inside) a pan of simmering water. Whisk until the mixture is warm and the sugar is dissolved (it should feel completely smooth when rubbed between your fingers), 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk the egg white mixture on medium speed for 5 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high and whisk the meringue until stiff, glossy peaks form and the bottom of the mixing bowl is cool to the touch, about 7 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium low. Add the butter a few tablespoons at a time, beating well after each addition. (If the frosting appears to separate after all of the butter has been added, simply increase the speed to medium high and beat until smooth again.) Add the vanilla and salt and continue beating until the frosting is smooth and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Trim the tops of the cooled cake layers with a knife so they are flat. Place the bottom layer on a cake stand or platter and spread evenly with about 1 cup of the frosting. Place the second layer on top of the first. Spread evenly with about 1 cup frosting. Place the remaining layer on top of the second layer. Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake, using an offset spatula to create large swirls. Decorate with sprinkles as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 71502,&quot;Individual Chicken Pot Pies 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 4 teaspoons salt plus a pinch 2 cups peeled and diced red potatoes (3 or 4 medium potatoes)<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter, plus more for greasing the ramekins<br> 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced<br> 1/2 cup sliced celery (about 2 stalks)<br> 1 medium onion, finely diced<br> Pinch ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 cups milk<br> 1 cup whole-kernel corn<br> 1 cup frozen green peas<br> 1 teaspoon celery seeds<br> Pinch garlic powder 2 cups baking mix such as Bisquick, or self-rising flour 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) butter, melted<br> 2 cups buttermilk 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the filling: Place the chicken breasts in a large stockpot along with 2 teaspoons of the salt and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate to cool, reserving 3 cups of the broth; supplement with canned chicken stock if you are short. When cool enough to handle, cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. While the chicken is cooking, combine the potatoes and the remaining 2 teaspoons salt in a medium stockpot. Fill with water to cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and cook until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and set aside to cool. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the carrots and cook for 5 minutes. Add the celery, onion and a pinch of salt and pepper; cook until the onions are soft and almost translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and, once melted, add the flour to make a roux. Cook the flour for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, then add the milk and reserved chicken broth. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the chicken, corn, peas, celery seeds and garlic powder. Remove from the heat. Grease eight 10-ounce ramekins with butter and place on a large, rimmed baking sheet or jellyroll pan. (Alternatively, grease one 9-by-13-inch baking dish.) Evenly divide the potatoes among the ramekins. Spoon the filling over the potatoes, leaving about 1/4-inch of space at the top for the crust. For the crust: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the baking mix and pepper until well blended. Whisk in the melted butter and buttermilk until smooth. Stir in the Parmesan. Pour some batter into each ramekin and smooth over the top, being careful not to mix it into the filling. Bake until the crust is crispy and nicely browned, 40 to 45 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71503,&quot;Braised Chicken with Tomatillos and Jalapenos 6 tomatillos, husked 2 jalapenos Extra-virgin olive oil 4 chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and skin 4 chicken legs Kosher salt 1 large Spanish onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice 3 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 2 cups chicken stock 2 limes, zested and juiced 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus a few more leaves for garnish 1/2 cup sour cream 2 limes, zested and juiced Instructions: For the chicken: Preheat the grill. Place the tomatillos and jalapenos on the grill and cook until the skins char and blister, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the tomatillos and jalapenos from the grill and let cool. Coat a large, wide straight-sided saute pan with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Sprinkle the chicken generously with salt. Add the chicken legs and thighs, skin-side down, to the hot pan. Brown the chicken well on all sides. Remove from the pan and reserve. Ditch the excess fat from the pan and add a few drops of new oil. Add the onions, season with salt and cook until the onions are very soft and aromatic, 7 to 8 minutes. While the onions are cooking, coarsely chop the tomatillos and reserve. Chop the jalapenos into 1/4-inch dice and reserve with the tomatillos. If you want to tone down the heat, remove the seeds from the jalapenos before chopping. Add the garlic to the pan with the onions and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the reserved tomatillos and jalapenos. Stir to combine and add the chicken stock, lime juice and zest. Taste and season with salt if needed (it probably will). Return the chicken to the pan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove the lid and let cook for 15 more minutes. This will allow the stock to reduce. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. For the sour cream: Combine the sour cream with the lime zest and juice and reserve. Remove the chicken from the pan and stir in the cilantro. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, sprinkle with cilantro leaves and serve with the lime sour cream.

Rinse the filet medallions and pat completely dry. Add the medallions to a medium mixing bowl, and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with sea salt, a few pinches of seasoned salt, and black pepper. With your hands, rub both sides of the medallions until they are covered with the oil and spices. Set aside in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, cover the bottom of a glass baking dish with aluminum foil. Cut off a small slice from the bottom of each pear they can stand up straight and arrange them, upright, in the baking pan. Add garlic and drizzle the pears and garlic with olive oil. Cover with aluminum foil. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes. Allow the pears to cool for 30 minutes and then peel off the skin and remove the core. Add the garlic, pears and chicken stock to a blender and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into saucepan over low heat and season with a couple of pinches of sea salt and pepper and let simmer for a couple of minutes. Heat the broiler. Cover a baking sheet with foil and arrange the filet mignon medallions on the pan. Charbroil on high on the top rack, about 6 inches below the broiler. Broil for 5 to 7 minutes for medium-rare. Do not flip. Ladle a bed of the roasted pear and garlic sauce on each of 6 plates.

Add the parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the nutmeg and mix to combine. Scrape the butter onto a piece of plastic wrap and form into a log. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes, or freeze up to 1 week. Combine the milk, 1 teaspoon salt and the bay leaf in a large saucepan. Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces, adding them to the pot as you go so they don&#39;t discolor. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat; cook, stirring to prevent the milk from scorching, until the potatoes are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, reserving the milk in a liquid measuring cup or bowl; discard the bay leaf. Return the potatoes to the saucepan and add all but about 1 tablespoon of the herb butter. Mash with a potato masher, gradually adding the reserved milk as needed, until creamy (you may have leftover milk). Season with salt. Transfer to a serving dish and top with the remaining 1 tablespoon herb butter just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71515,&quot;Vidalia Onion Pie 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher or Hawaiian salt 1/4 cup cold all-vegetable shortening, cut into small pieces 1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces Cold water 1/4 egg yolk and 1 teaspoon water for egg wash 1/2 cup unsalted butter 2 pounds Vidalia onions, thinly sliced 3 large eggs, beaten 1 cup sour cream 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon kosher or Hawaiian salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: For the crust: All ingredients should be cold. Combine all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add shortening and butter. Using a pastry blender cut in the shortening and butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Drop by drop, add cold water. Mix in with the fingertips, not with the hands as the palms will warm the dough. Continue mixing water in until the dough begins to hold together without being sticky but not crumbly. Place dough in plastic wrap. Fold over plastic wrap and press down to form a disk. This will make rolling out easier after chilling. Finish wrapping in plastic and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Lightly spray a deep 9-inch pie pan or an 8 1/2-inch fluted flan pan. Roll out dough and place in pie plate. Return to the refrigerator until filling is ready. Makes pastry for a 9-inch single crust pie. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. For the filling: Brush egg wash on the inside of pie crust. Return to refrigerator until filling is ready. Over medium heat, melt butter. Add onions and saute until translucent. Do not brown. Combine eggs, sour cream and flour. Add onion mixture. Season with salt and pepper and pour into chilled pie crust. Top with Parmesan. Bake for 20 minutes.

Top with the scallions and wonton chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 71517,&quot;Pizza Party Pizzas About 3 tablespoons extravirgin olive oil as needed 1 package active dry yeast 1/2 cup lukewarm water for yeast, plus 2 cups lukewarm water for dough Pinch, plus 2 teaspoons sugar 1 scant tablespoon salt 1 to 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper (optional) Up to 6 1/2 cups unbleached allpurpose flour, including flour for dusting Cornmeal, for pizza pans (preferably mediumground) 1 egg white, at room temperature, mixed with 1 teaspoon water and strained Sesame seeds (optional), for topping rim of pizza Freshly ground black pepper About 6 cups freshly grated cheese (preferably a combination of fresh mozzarella, Muenster and Parmesan) 1 1/2 to 2 cups bestquality tomato sauce or marinara sauce (if storebought, embellish with freshly minced garlic and chopped fresh basil leaves) About 1/2 cup chopped or slivered fresh basil leaves Sliced and Sauteed mushrooms Thinly sliced pepperoni<br> Freshly chopped garlic<br> Thinly sliced yellow onions or leeks, sauteed in butter or extravirgin olive oil<br> Drained and coarsely chopped firm anchovy fillets Small cubes of eggplant, lightly tossed in seasoned flour and panfried in olive oil<br> Small cubes of eggplant, lightly tossed in seasoned flour and panfried in olive oil Diced potatoes, boiled 5 minutes, drained and panfried<br> Pitted and sliced kalamata olives or milder oilcured olives<br> Red and/or yellow bell peppers, roasted, seeded and sliced into thin strips Red and/or yellow bell peppers, roasted, seeded and sliced into thin strips<br> Sliced pancetta (unsmoked Italian bacon) fried until crisp and drained<br> Black Forest Bacon (slab bacon) sliced 1/3inch thick and diced (fry until crisp and drain) Fresh Italian sausage, removed from casings and sauteed in extravirgin olive oil with minced onion and garlic<br> Fresh Italian sausage, removed from casings and sauteed in extravirgin olive oil with minced onion and garlic Crushed red pepper flakes (be careful) Instructions: To set up: Brush the interior of a 5quart mixing bowl generously with olive oil and set aside for rising dough. To assemble liquid mixture: Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar. In a large mixing bowl, combine the 2 cups lukewarm water, 1 generous tablespoon of the olive oil, salt, the 2 teaspoons sugar, and pepper, if using. When yeast mixture is creamy and starting to bubble, add to mixing bowl and briskly stir in just enough flour, a little at a time, to create a mass that is not easily stirred in the bowl. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured wooden board. Using floured hands, knead dough in a brisk pushfoldandturn motion, until perfectly smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Add only as much additional flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking to your hands and work surface. Use a pastry scraper while kneading to scrape dough off board cleanly as you continue to knead in a sufficient amount of flour. To rise dough twice: Place dough in the prepared rising bowl and turn to coat it with olive oil. Cover bowl with a piece of oiled plastic wrap and then with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm, draftfree spot until doubled, about 2 hours. Punch down dough with several swift swats with the back of your hand until dough is totally deflated. Although dough can be used right away, it&#39;s preferable to refrigerate it for at least 1 hour and as long as 2 days before shaping crusts. (Chilling relaxes the dough so it won&#39;t fight back so much when being stretched into shape and the extra time allows the dough to develop a deeper, more satisfying flavor.)<br> To set up to prebake crusts: Position the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and, if using, place a sheet of quarry tiles or a large pizza stone onto rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for at least 30 minutes before baking. Lightly brush both perforated pizza pans with olive oil and sprinkle with cornmeal; tilt to coat pans and tap out excess meal. If using, set eggwhite glaze and sesame seeds next to your work surface.<br> To shape pizza dough: Turn out dough onto a lightly floured board and gently knead just to release air pockets. Using the blade of a pastry scraper, divide dough into 2 equal pieces. If dough is not chilled, cover and let rest for 10 minutes to relax dough. If not working with a double oven and thus can only bake 1 crust at a time, return half the dough to the bowl, cover and refrigerate until the first pizza crust goes into the oven. Pat the remaining half dough into a low round on the floured work surface.<br> To stretch dough: Spread the fingers of your hand and smack dough several times until visibly flattened but still round. Flour your fists, lift up dough and drape it (centered) over your floured fists. Stretch dough by pointing your fists upward and gently pulling them away from each other. Take care to stretch evenly; if dough starts to feel bottom heavy and is becoming too thin, lay it on your work surface, rearrange it, then lift and continue to stretch. Use as much flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking to your hands, which can cause it to tear.<br> To place dough in pan: Lay stretched dough in the prepared pan, arranging it so the edges of dough meet the rim. Press and pat out dough until it totally covers the pan, building up the rim of dough so it&#39;s a little thicker and higher than the interior of the circle. It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect, just not overly thick in one spot and paper thin in another. If dough resists at any point, just throw a towel over it for 5 minutes. If dough should tear, just pinch it together with floured fingertips. And if the rim seems too thin, simply fold 1-inch of the edge over onto itself and press to adhere. Additional Topping Suggestions: To prepare crust for prebaking: Brush the interior of the circle (excluding the 1inch rim) with some olive oil and prick the oiled section of the dough deeply all over with a docker or the prongs of a large fork. Sprinkle oiled dough with freshly ground black pepper. If desired, brush the raised rim of dough with egg white glaze and sprinkle rim generously with sesame seeds.<br> To prebake crust: Place 4 ice cubes into a 1cup measuring cup and add enough cold water to measure 1/4 cup. Prick the interior surface of crust once more and place pizza pan directly on hot tiles, stone or oven rack. Immediately toss ice water onto the oven floor, underneath the tiles, and shut the oven door. Bake until lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven using a baker&#39;s peel and place it on a wire rack to cool. Meanwhile, as crust is baking, remove the reserved half of dough from refrigerator and prepare the second crust completely through the preceding step. As soon as you remove the first crust from the oven, prick the second crust again, place in oven and administer ice water as directed above.<br> To set up for baking topped pizza: After prebaking, the crust is sealed, so if you like, you may remove quarry tiles or pizza stone from oven. If baking 2 pizzas the in same oven, position oven racks to the upper and lower thirds; if using a double oven, use the center rack for each pizza. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F until very hot. To bake and serve completed pizza: Bake in the hot oven until crust is deeply golden, toppings are piping hot and cheese is bubbling, about 20 minutes. If using the same oven for both pizzas, switch positions of pies after half the baking time for even heat exposure. To serve, insert a baker&#39;s peel under the pizza pan and place the pie on a solid (nonperforated) pizza pan. Slice into wedges using a pizza wheel and serve immediately.<br> To prepare topping: Scatter some grated cheese over the interior of the prebaked crust. Spoon or ladle about 1 cup tomato sauce on top of cheese (not too much or your pizza will be soupy). Spread sauce over crust, stopping just before the rim. Scatter one or more of the suggested toppings over sauce, along with chopped basil leaves. Scatter half of the grated cheese over the top, allowing some of the toppings to be visible through cheese. Drizzle 1 teaspoon fruity olive oil over pizza and then finally top with some sliced pepperoni, if desired. Grind on some fresh black pepper. Repeat with the remaining pizza. FreeForm Pizzas Baked Directly on Quarry Tiles or a Pizza Stone<br> You do not need a pizza pan for this method and you do not need to prebake the crust before assembling and baking. Position the rack and quarry tiles or pizza stone as directed for prebaking crusts. When preheating, increase the oven temperature to 500 F. Sprinkle a baker&#39;s peel generously with cornmeal. Prepare and stretch dough as directed and place it directly on the peel. Rearrange the thin round, to correct the shape. Brush the interior of dough with olive oil and sprinkle with fresh pepper. Docking is not necessary since the weight of the toppings will prevent dough from swelling underneath. (If applying seeds to the rim, try not to let the egg white drip onto the baker&#39;s peel since this will cause dough to stick to the peel.)<br> Top dough as you would a prebaked crust and assemble ice cubes and water as directed. Lift the loaded baker&#39;s peel and give it a gentle shake to make sure that the pizza is not stuck. Open oven door and insert peel all the way to the back of the oven. With one swift jerk, remove peel, leaving pizza on the hot tiles. Immediately, toss ice water onto the oven floor and shut the door. Bake until golden and bubbling, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove pizza by sliding the peel underneath it and place on a nonperforated pizza pan. Cut into wedges and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>&quot; 71518,&quot;Holiday Brie en Croute 1 egg 1 tablespoon water 1/2 of a 17.3-ounce package Pepperidge Farm?

Prepare the rind:<br> Cut the watermelon into 3/4-inch slices. Trim the rind away from the pink flesh; make sure no pink is left on the rind. Trim away the outer skin. Cut the rind into approximately 3/4-inch cubes. Toss with the pickling salt in a large bowl and refrigerate overnight.<br> Day 2. Prepare the jars and lids:<br> Wash all jars and lids thoroughly with soap and water and rinse well. Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil.<br> Pickle the rind:<br> Rinse the rind thoroughly and drain, twice. In a large stockpot, combine the vinegar, sugar and cloves, and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the rind to the brine, bring back to the boil, reduce to a low boil and cook uncovered until the rind is translucent, about 20 minutes.<br> Fill and close the jars:<br> Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the stockpot with the pickled rind. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the pickled rind into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight.<br> Seal the jars:<br> Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 5 minutes.<br> Remove and cool:<br> Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately.<br> Label and store:<br> Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned.

Place the peaches, sugar, fresh ginger, ground ginger, white pepper and 3 cups water in a large saucepan over medium heat. Let simmer for 20 minutes. Drain the peaches and reserve the cooking liquid. Return the cooking liquid to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced by half and has a syrupy consistency. Pour the syrup over the peaches and hold in the oven. The peaches can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated. Gently rewarm in a saucepan. For the ricotta filling: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the ricotta and cream cheese. Mix on high until perfectly smooth. Add the sugar and almond extract and pulse until combined. Transfer to a small bowl. The ricotta filling will keep in the refrigerator for three days. For the Swedish pancakes: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the eggs, milk, sugar and almond extract and whisk until light and fluffy. Add the flour and salt and whisk thoroughly to eliminate all lumps and make a smooth batter. With the stand mixer running on low, slowly stream in the melted butter until well combined. For a thinner pancake, adjust the thickness of the batter by adding a bit more milk. The pancake batter will keep in the refrigerator for up to three days. Whisk before using. Heat a griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly butter the skillet and wait until the butter gets frothy and light in color but not browned. Add 1/8 cup of the pancake batter to the pan and cook until the edges are lightly browned. Flip over the pancake, put a spoonful of the ricotta filling into the center and cook until the other side is light golden brown.

Heat, stirring, until the chocolate is almost melted (about 100 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer). Remove from the heat and add the remaining chopped chocolate in 2 or 3 additions, stirring until melted. The tempered chocolate will be thick and about 90 degrees F. Divide the chocolate among 2 large 6-cavity silicone hot chocolate bomb molds (2 1/2-inch diameter cavities). Use a small brush to brush the chocolate up the sides, making an even coat on the sides and in the bottom. Make sure the sides are thick enough all the way to the edge of the molds. Let sit at room temperature until completely set, 20 to 30 minutes. (If it is very hot, you can pop the molds in the refrigerator for a minute or two to finish.)<br> Wearing latex gloves, gently remove the chocolate half-spheres from the molds. Set on a piece of parchment paper on your work surface. Divide the hot cocoa among 6 of the half-spheres, then add 3 or 4 pumpkin marshmallows, 1 ghost, 1 spider and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon sprinkles to each of the same half-spheres.<br> Warm a small nonstick skillet over very low heat. To seal the bombs, set an unfilled half-sphere on the skillet open-side down for just a second to warm the chocolate. Set on top of a filled half-sphere, matching the seams as much as possible. Repeat with the remaining half-spheres. Let sit until hardened, about 5 minutes.<br> To make the marshmallow webs: Put the regular marshmallows in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until the marshmallows inflate and soften, 10 to 15 seconds. With gloved hands, pull up a little bit of marshmallow and stretch between your fingers to make thin webbing. Stretch the webbing over and around the bombs. Continue to pull and stretch the marshmallow until all of the bombs are covered in webbing. Add 2 candy eyes or a spider to each, if desired.<br> To serve, heat 6 to 8 ounces milk per bomb until very hot. Add to mugs and drop in the bombs. Enjoy, stirring to melt the chocolate.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71552,&quot;Roast Poussin/Cornish Hen and Sweet Potatoes 2 poussins/Cornish hens 2 tablespoons garlic or wok oil, divided 1 sweet potato weighing approximately 1 pound 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 to 2 bunches watercress Maldon or kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Good squirt lime juice Instructions: This is my almost regular as clockwork Saturday night supper. I find it enormously easy and relaxing to make since all I do is go downstairs, put everything in the oven, and then go back up to Saturday evening tv in bed until it&#39;s ready - and then, frankly, back again. If I cook the poussins/ Cornish hens in the same pan as the sweet potatoes, I cut a couple of slices of bread and put 1 underneath each bird in the tin, so as to absorb the juices and stop them from seeping into the sweet potatoes which, in turn, would prevent them from crisping and browning. But more often than not, I dispense with the bread (you can imagine how good it tastes later though) and just get 2 disposable foil roasting trays about the size of brownie tins each and put the poussins/ Cornish hens in one and the sweet potatoes in another and reuinite on the plate with a little watercress and a squirt of lime juice later. I must have English mustard with. I know it&#39;s a weakness, but not one I&#39;m willing to renounce. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the birds into a small baking tin or foil tray pouring over 1 tablespoon of oil. Cut the unpeeled sweet potatoes into 2 1/2-inch cubes and put them into another smallish tin or foil tray.Pour over the other tablespoon of oil and sprinkle over the spices, and then toss everything together by shaking the tin. Cook both the poussins/hens and sweet potatoes in the preheated hot oven for 45 minutes. Put each poussin/Cornish hen on a plate, with a tangle of watercress and the sweet potatoes alongside. Sprinkle with Maldon/kosher salt, to taste, and spritz with lime juice and go to it! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 71553,&quot;Chicken Scarpariello 1 whole 3 pound chicken, backbone removed and split down the breastbone 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon white wine 1 clove garlic, sliced 1/4 teaspoon chili pepper flakes 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped 1/2 cup olive oil 1 carrot, chopped 1 stalk celery, chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 2 rosemary sprigs Salt and pepper to taste Scarpariello Sauce, recipe follows 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon sliced garlic 1 cup broccoli florets, steamed 1 cup red potatoes, roasted and sliced 1/2 cup button mushrooms, Sauteed 1/4 cup white wine 1 cup chicken stock Juice of one lemon 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped 2 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Then squeeze out the excess water, and place the bread, vinegar and garlic in a food processor and puree until smooth. While the machine is still running, drizzle in the olive oil and process until combined. Add the chives and parsley, and pulse a few more times to combine. Season with salt and more vinegar, if you like (I like a very bright, acidic dipping sauce). Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl. For the cauliflower: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl of well-salted water with ice, and line a baking sheet with paper towels. Toss the cauliflower in the boiling water. When the water returns to a boil, cook the cauliflower for 2 more minutes, then drain and immediately plunge the cauliflower in the ice water. When the cauliflower is cool, drain and lay it out to dry on the prepared baking sheet. In a large saucepan, pour enough peanut oil to fill the pan 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the sides. Heat over medium-high heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. To see if it&#39;s hot enough, drop some flour into it. If the flour sizzles and floats quickly, you&#39;re good to go. If the flour burns or the oil begins to smoke, it&#39;s too hot, so reduce the heat. Set up standard breading procedure: one bowl of the flour, one bowl for the eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons water, and one for the breadcrumbs and Parm. Then place a couple layers of paper towels on a baking sheet next to the stovetop. When the oil is hot, dredge some cauliflower in the flour and shake off the excess, then dip it in the egg mixture, and finally through the breadcrumb mixture. Repeat this process for the remaining cauliflower. Working in batches so you don&#39;t overcrowd the pan, fry the cauliflower until brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the cauliflower to the paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and serve hot, hot and hot with the agliata sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 71561,&quot;Brined Butterflied Chicken Alla Diavola with Lemony Fennel Slaw 1 cup kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, plus more for seasoning 1 head garlic, halved lengthwise 4 whole chiles de arbol, crushed 4 cups ice cubes One 3-pound whole chicken, butterflied 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon sugar 1 small head Savoy cabbage, thinly sliced 1 small bulb fennel, thinly sliced 1/4 cup fennel fronds (leaves) 1/2 cup fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 8 whole black peppercorns 6 dried chiles de arbol, lightly toasted and crushed 6 cloves garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 lemons, halved and grilled Parsley leaves Instructions: For the brine: Bring 4 cups water, the salt, peppercorns, garlic and chiles to a boil. Stir until the salt is dissolved. Remove the brine from the heat and cool slightly. Stir in the ice cubes. The brine should be cold when you add the chicken. Add the chicken, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Meanwhile, for the lemony fennel slaw: Whisk the mayonnaise, lemon zest, lemon juice and sugar in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, fennel, fronds and parsley in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove the chicken from the brine, rinse well with cold water and pat dry. Place the chicken skin-side up on a baking rack set over a baking sheet. Refrigerate the chicken for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. This will allow the chicken skin to dry out and produce a crisper crust on the grill. Meanwhile, for the cl oil: Combine the oil, peppercorns, chiles, garlic, oregano and salt in a small saucepan over low heat and simmer. Remove the saucepan from the heat and keep at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Transfer the oil to a blender and blend until smooth. Drain the oil into a bowl. Heat the grill for direct medium heat and indirect grilling. If using charcoal, make sure the bottom vents and top vents of the grill are open. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Brush the chicken with 3 tablespoons of the cl oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the chicken skin-side down over the coals, on direct heat. Grill the chicken until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. Flip the chicken and move it over the indirect heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 160 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Add coals as necessary to maintain the grill temperature at about 400 degrees F. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board; wait 10 minutes before carving. Carve the chicken and drizzle with the remaining cl oil. Garnish the chicken with grilled lemon halves and parsley leaves. Serve with the lemony fennel slaw on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 71562,&quot;Red Rice Perloo 2 cups parboiled rice 1 stalk celery, cut into large chunks<br> 1 large yellow onion, cut into large chunks<br> 1 green bell pepper, cut into large chunks<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> One and a half 6-ounce cans tomato paste<br> Pinch granulated sugar<br> Pinch Miss Brown&#39;s House Seasoning, recipe follows, plus more if desired 2 cups sliced fresh okra (about 1/2 pound)<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, undrained<br> 2 to 4 cups vegetable stock<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh curly-leaf parsley, optional 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon sweet paprika<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Rinse the rice until the water becomes slightly clear. (This removes the starch.) Process the celery, onion and bell pepper in a food processor or until finely minced. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the minced vegetables. Cook until the vegetables are softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, sugar and House Seasoning and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the okra, rice and butter and cook for about 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and vegetable stock and check for seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover.

Warm the chicken broth and add the saffron strands, then allow to steep at least 1 hour or up to 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade. In a Dutch oven over high heat, brown the chicken thighs on both sides in 2 tablespoons olive oil, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Set chicken aside on a plate. Reduce the heat to medium, add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan, and saute the onion until golden, about 5 minutes. Place the chicken thighs on top of the onions and add any accumulated juices from the plate. Arrange the zucchini and yellow squash and tomato quarters on top of the chicken and tuck in the prunes and olives. Season well with salt and pepper. Pour over the chicken broth and saffron.

Add the shallots, oil, honey, mustard, cilantro, parsley, thyme, garlic, oregano, wine, 1 tablespoon kosher salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper to the bag. Cut the oranges in half, squeeze the juice into the marinade and then add the halves as well. Seal the bag, squeezing out any excess air, then massage the marinade into the steak, making sure all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. Marinate the steak in the refrigerator for 2 1/2 hours. Preheat a grill for cooking over medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, making sure to pull off any marinade ingredients like herbs or shallots that stick to the steak (reserve the marinade). Generously sprinkle the steak all over with salt and pepper. Grill until dark grill marks form, 3 to 4 minutes per side; then turn the heat down, cover the grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers 130 degrees F for medium-rare, another 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the steak from the grill and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place the marinade in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thickened and reduced down to 1 1/2 cups, approximately 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer. To serve: Rub a cutting board with olive oil and garlic, then sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Put the steak on top and slice it against the grain. Garnish with cilantro and parsley leaves, and serve with the red wine herb sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo]&quot; 71567,&quot;Whitebait Vegetable oil, for frying 18 ounces whitebait 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 bunch fresh curly parsley Maldon or other sea salt Lemon wedges, for plating Instructions: Heat the oil for frying in a deep-fat fryer to about 375 degrees F. Put the whitebait and the seasoned flour into a plastic bag, and toss everything around to coat the fish. Shake the excess flour by turning out the whole bag into a metal sieve, and then plunge the little fishes into the oil. Cook for about 3 minutes or until they look crispy and tempting - though I can see that for a squeamish generation, the idea of eating baby fish, whole, might not tempt. How wrong they are, if that&#39;s the case. Turn them out onto paper towels, and while the fish are losing any excess oil (we want desirable crunch) throw in a small handful of parsley leaves to deep-fry; watch out, it will spit. (A splatter guard is useful. Not charming, but useful.) When they have turned a very dark green, drain and serve with the whitebait, well sprinkled with sea salt and surrounded with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 71568,&quot;Pineapple Casserole Two 20-ounce cans pineapple chunks, juice reserved 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon cornstarch 2 cups roughly crushed buttery crackers, such as Ritz (45 crackers; 1 1/2 sleeves) 2 cups grated sharp Cheddar<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Drain the pineapple juice into a liquid measuring cup; you should have 1 1/2 cups. Whisk in the sugar and cornstarch until the sugar dissolves. Spread the pineapple chunks in the bottom of a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and pour over the pineapple juice mixture, stirring to coat the chunks evenly. In a large bowl, stir together the crushed crackers, cheese and butter, then sprinkle the topping evenly over the pineapple. Bake the casserole until the topping is golden brown, the cheese is melted and the pineapple is bubbling in the center of the dish, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the casserole cool for 5 minutes, then serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 71569,&quot;Skillet Corn and Potato Toss 1 Tbsp. olive oil 3/4 cup diced onion 3/4 cup diced red or green bell pepper 1 can (14.5 oz.)

Spray a 6-inch springform pan with cooking spray to coat the bottom and sides. Add the graham crackers to a resealable plastic bag. Using your hands or a rolling pin, crush the graham crackers into crumbs. Transfer them to a mixing bowl and add the melted butter. Fold and press together with a spatula until a loose, crumbly mixture is made. Pour the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan and press to create an even base for the cheesecake. Chill the crust in the fridge while you make the filling to set the base. For the filling: Add the chocolate to a heatproof bowl and set the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Heat, stirring with a spatula, until the chocolate is melted and completely smooth. Set aside. Mix the cream cheese, sugar and cocoa powder in a food processor until smooth. Remove the lid and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla, salt and egg and process until completely incorporated. Scrape down the sides once more. Turn the machine back on and while the machine is running, drizzle in the melted chocolate and allow it to completely incorporate into the mixture. Pour the chocolate filling over the prepared crust and smooth out the top with a spatula. Transfer the cheesecake to the center rack and bake until the filling is no longer soupy but still slightly jiggly, about 32 minutes. Turn off the oven and open the door just a hair. Allow the cheesecake to sit in the warm oven for 15 more minutes with the door ajar. Transfer the cheesecake to a cooling rack and let cool for 30 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the edge of the pan to help free the cheesecake, but keep it in the pan. The cheesecake will continue to shrink while it cools and this step makes it easier to separate the cheesecake when you are ready to serve it. For the topping: Pour the cherry pie filling onto the cooled cheesecake and smooth into an even layer, leaving a bit uncovered around the edges. Cover the springform pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. When you are ready to eat, remove the cheesecake from the fridge and transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with a sprig of mint and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 71571,&quot;Indulgent Shallot Tart 1 1/2 pounds banana shallots, peeled and cut into quarters 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided\\u202f<br> 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar\\u202f<br> 3 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, 1 tablespoon chopped and 2 tablespoons leaves left whole to serve\\u202f<br> 1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt\\u202f<br> 3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk\\u202f<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch\\u202f<br> 1 scant tablespoon vegetable bouillon powder\\u202f<br> 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard\\u202f<br> 1/4 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc\\u202f<br> 14 to 17 ounces frozen puff pastry, thawed\\u202f<br> 3/4 cup pre-cooked dark Puy lentils\\u202f<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add enough cold water to cover the beans by 2 inches. Cover and let soak in the refrigerator until the beans are hydrated and doubled in size, 8 to 10 hours. Drain and transfer the beans to a large pot. Add 10 cups cold water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to avoid scorching the bottom. Lower the heat to medium and let simmer, skimming the foam off the top as needed, until the beans are cooked through but still slightly firm and holding their shape, about 25 minutes. (The skins should easily slide off at this point and the beans should not completely disintegrate when pressed between two fingers.) Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small saute pan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until nutty, fragrant and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to a small bowl. In the same pan, toast the pine nuts, stirring constantly, until nutty, fragrant and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to another small bowl; set both bowls aside. Reserve 3 cups of the bean cooking water then drain the beans in a colander in the sink. Insert the colander in a large bowl and gently massage the beans under running water to remove the skins. Agitate the water to help the skins float to the top then skim them off with a small strainer or slotted spoon; repeat until at least 1 cup of the skins are removed. Combine the beans with the reserved bean water in a blender. Add the sugar, pine nuts, 3 tablespoons of the sesame seeds, 3 cups cold water and 2 teaspoons salt. Blend on medium-high speed until smooth and homogenous, 2 to 4 minutes. If your blender is not large enough to hold all the soy milk, blend it in two batches and transfer each batch to a large bowl. For a thinner, milk-like consistency, strain the soy milk through a fine-mesh sieve or add more water. Refrigerate the soy milk in an airtight container until very cold, about 4 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package directions. Drain in a colander and rinse in a running bath of cold water, rubbing the noodles between your hands and gently massaging them in the water to remove the excess starch. Drain then repeat the rinsing, rubbing and massaging two more times. Drain thoroughly. Divide the noodles among 4 large soup bowls and top with the chilled soy milk. Divide the cucumber, tomatoes, eggs and remaining 1 tablespoon sesame seeds among the bowls, layering them on top of the noodles. Add ice cubes to the broth if desired.

If you don&#39;t have a liquidizer just use your hands to squeeze, mash and really push the peaches through a sieve so you get as much as possible of their wonderful flavour and the colour from their skins into the puree. You can get the puree as fine as you like, but I don&#39;t mind the thickness...it&#39;s quite rustic.

Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the salt is dissolved and the water is fragrant. Turn off the heat and let cool completely. Place the turkey in a roasting bag, large plastic bag or bowl large enough to fit it with still more space to give. Pour in the brining liquid and seal or cover. If there&#39;s not enough room for all of the liquid in the brine, be sure to at least include the herbs, lemon and peppercorns. Refrigerate at least overnight or up to 3 days. When ready to cook, remove from the refrigerator and discard all of the brining liquid and solids. For the turkey: Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. Place the turkey cavity-side down on a wire rack resting in a roasting/baking dish and allow to sit on the countertop for about 2 hours to come to room temperature. Using kitchen shears or a knife, cut the backbone of the turkey out and break the breastbone to open up and flatten the bird by gently pressing down with the skin-side up. Flip over and pat dry. Using your finger, gently release the skin from the muscle of the turkey and insert the butter pieces between the skin and meat all over the bird. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle the skin with salt and pepper. Preheat the grill to 400 degrees F. Place the turkey over direct heat skin-side down. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F and close the lid of the grill. Cook until the turkey releases from the grates and reveals grill marks, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the olive oil and black pepper together in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Steep over medium heat until the oil smells and tastes like pepper, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the honey, Worcestershire sauce, lemon zest and lemon juice to the same pan. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to simmer and slightly reduce. Remove from the heat and rest until it tightens a bit, about 2 minutes. Flip the turkey and glaze the skin with the lemon pepper glaze. Close the lid of the grill and continue to cook, glazing every 30 minutes, until an internal-read thermometer inserted in the thigh reads 160 degrees F, 1 to 2 hours.

Add the tomato puree and 1 cup water. Stir in the oregano and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Generously brush two 9 1/2-inch round deep-dish pizza pans (or 9-inch cake pans) with about 3 tablespoons olive oil each. Divide the dough in half; press each half into the bottom of a pan. Let the dough rest, 15 minutes. Push the dough down and press it up the sides of the pans with your fingers. Layer the cheese on top of each crust and spread each with 1 1/2 cups sauce. Bake the pizzas until the crust is dark golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 40 to 45 minutes (it will still be jiggly in the center). Sprinkle with parmesan (if using); let cool 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into wedges. You can freeze the baked pizza for up to a month. Let it cool, then tightly wrap in plastic and foil. To reheat, unwrap and bake at 325 degrees F until hot and bubbling, 50 to 60 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 71632,&quot;Corned Beef and Cabbage on Potato 12 large red bliss potatoes peeled and cut into 1-inch thick slices 1/2 pound smoked bacon 3 tablespoons butter 1/2 head napa cabbage, cut chiffonade Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 pound corned beef, finely diced 2 teaspoons prepared horseradish 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives 1 cup milk 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 bay leaf 3 whole cloves 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, optional 2 tablespoons unsalted melted butter 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/2 cup grated Parmesan (1/4 cup for sauce plus 1/8 to 1/4 cup to bind filling and sprinkle on finished appetizers) White pepper Salt, if needed Instructions: Cut potato slices with a 1 to 1 1/2-inch circle cutter and soak in water to remove starch. Place on a rack placed over a shallow pan of water. Steam to al dente and set aside to cool. Using a melon baller (ball scoop) scoop out a recess in each disk. Cook bacon and remove to paper towels to drain. Pour most of the bacon fat from the pan and add butter over medium heat. Add cabbage and season with black pepper. Cook until it begins to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in corned beef, and crumble in bacon. Cook together for about 10 minutes to allow flavors to integrate, remove from heat and stir in horseradish. To begin the sauce: Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves, and nutmeg over medium heat. Spoon the melted butter into a separate heat resistant bowl and whisk in the cornstarch, then whisk in 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, reserving the rest. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the cheese mixture, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf and cloves. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Stir enough of the sauce and reserved Parmesan into the corned beef/cabbage mixture to bind into a thick mixture. Spoon the mixture onto prepared potato disks, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and place on a baking sheet. Flash finish in oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes (monitor to make sure they don&#39;t burn). Sprinkle with chives and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 71633,&quot;Hot Times Jalapeno Turkey Breast 1 (6 to 8-pound) turkey breast Hot Times Rub, recipe follows Hot Times Mop, recipe follows 3 tablespoons dried ground jalapeno, (recommended: North of the Border PC Willy&#39;s Green cl Rub and Seasoning) 2 tablespoons kosher or sea salt 2 tablespoons packed light or dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 2 cups chicken or turkey stock 2 to 3 teaspoons dried ground jalapeno 1/4 cup unsalted butter or vegetable oil 1/4 cup jalapeno jelly Instructions: Massage the turkey breast with the Hot Times Rub, making sure to get it over and under the skin without tearing. Place the breast in a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 to 220 degrees F. Remove the turkey breast from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Cut a 3-foot piece of cheesecloth and dampen it thoroughly with water. Wrap the breast in the cheesecloth and tie the ends. Transfer the breast to the smoker, skin side up, and cook for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F. Wet the cheesecloth down with more water at 30-minute intervals, or as appropriate for the style of smoker. After 4 hours, remove the cheesecloth, snipping it with scissors if necessary, and discard. Baste the turkey with the Hot Times Mop- if possible in the smoker - every 30 minutes for the remainder of the cooking time. When the turkey is finished cooking, remove it from the smoker and allow it to sit under tented foil for at least 10 minutes before carving. Mix ingredients together in a small bowl. Combine the ingredients in a saucepan and warm the mixture over low heat. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 71634,&quot;Chocolate Sauce 10.5 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips 9 ounces milk 1.75 ounces heavy cream 1.75 ounces butter Instructions: Combine the milk with the heavy cream and bring them to simmer.

Lay the beef in a large roasting pan with the bone side down. (The ribs act as a natural roasting rack.) In a small bowl mash together the garlic, horseradish, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil to make a paste. Massage the paste generously over the entire roast. Scatter the vegetables around the meat and drizzle them with a 2-count of oil. Put the pan in the oven and roast the beef for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for medium-rare (or approximately 20 minutes per pound). Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer; it should register 125 degrees F. for medium-rare. Remove the beef to a carving board and let it rest for 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise by about 10 degrees. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Pour the pan juices into a fat separator or small bowl and set aside to allow the fat and beef juices to separate. Pour off and discard the fat. You can use the tasty beef juices for Sauteed Mushrooms. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 71638,&quot;Brined Fresh Ham 2 cups kosher salt 2 cups sugar 6 bay leaves 1/2 cup fennel seeds 1/2 cup mustard seeds 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes 1 bunch rosemary 20 garlic cloves, or garlic bulbs, cut in 1/2 equatorially 1 large onion, coarsely chopped 4 ribs celery, coarsely chopped 2 gallons water 1 (6 to 8-pound) bone-in fresh ham 8 sprigs rosemary, picked and leaves finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, smashed Large pinch crushed red pepper flakes Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds red bliss potatoes, cut in 1/2 Olive oil Salt 2 cups chicken stock 1 cup Dijon mustard 1 cup whole-grain mustard 1 cup honey Instructions: To brine the pork: Combine all of the ingredients in a large container. Submerse the ham in the brine and let it hang out for 3 days in the refrigerator. (It&#39;s a plan-ahead but soooooooooooooo worth it!) To cook the pork: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the ham from the brine, pat dry and make slices in the skin to create a diagonal cross-hatch pattern. To make the paste: In a food processor, combine the rosemary, garlic, crushed red pepper, salt, to taste, and about 1/2 cup of olive oil. Massage this mixture generously all over the outside of the ham. Put the potatoes in a roasting pan large enough to accommodate this whole shootin&#39; match. Toss the potatoes generously with some olive oil and salt. Nestle the ham on top of the potatoes and toss the whole thing in the preheated oven. Check the pork in about 30 minutes, the skin should be getting brown and crispy. At this point, remove the ham from the oven and turn over, baste with any leftover rosemary/olive oil paste and rearrange the potatoes so they don&#39;t burn. Nestle the pork back onto the potatoes and return to the oven. Roast for another 30 minutes. Remove the ham from the oven after the first hour. Check the potatoes to see if they are getting a little crispy, rearrange them and add the chicken stock to the bottom of the pan to keep things really moist and juicy. Reduce the heat in the oven to 350 degrees F and roast for another hour. To make the glaze: While the ham is cooking, combine the Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard and honey in a small bowl. Remove the ham from the oven and brush it, generously, with the honey mustard mixture. Return the ham to the oven and roast it for about 30 minutes. Flip it over and brush again with the honey mustard mixture (really slather it on the pork). Roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the ham from the oven, to a cutting board, tent it with aluminum foil and let it rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes before slicing. Carve that baby and arrange the slices on a serving platter.

Spread the tater tots on a baking sheet and bake until just golden brown and crispy, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the heavy cream, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off the bacon drippings and reserve 2 tablespoons. Add 1 tablespoon of the drippings and the sausage to the skillet and heat over medium-high. Cook, breaking up any large chunks with a wooden spoon, until cooked through and brown in some spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.<br> Return the skillet over medium heat and add the remaining tablespoon of bacon drippings. Once hot and shimmering, add the egg mixture and cook, stirring frequently, with a rubber spatula, until soft and fluffy and almost completely cooked through but still a bit runny, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a clean large bowl.<br> Coat the back of a baking sheet with cooking spray. Unroll both cans of crescent dough and separate unto 16 triangles. Put a 5-inch ramekin in the center of the prepared baking sheet. Arrange the triangles in a ring around the ramekin so the short sides of the dough are touching the ramekin, overlapping slightly, and the pointed ends are facing outward (it should look like a giant sun).<br> Spoon the egg mixture over the short ends of the triangles closest to the ramekin. Sprinkle the sausage on top of the eggs then sprinkle the bacon over the sausage. Cover the bacon with the American and Cheddar cheese. Top with the potato tots and remove the ramekin. Take hold of the pointed end of one of the triangles and fold it up and over the filling, tucking the tip under the bottom edge of dough to secure (the dough will not cover the filling completely but should cover the tater tots). Repeat with the remaining triangles (there will be some gaps where you can see the filling).<br> Bake until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 25 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Use a spatula to slide the ring off the baking sheet onto a platter.

Add the chicken powder, chicken and mushrooms and cook until the chicken is almost cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the fish sauce, lime juice, coconut milk and chili paste into the saucepan. Since the chili paste is thick, use a whisk to help break it apart and incorporate into the soup. Add the chopped cabbage and cook until just tender, about 1 minute. Divide the soup among serving bowls and garnish with cilantro. Place the chicken carcass or chicken pieces in an 8-quart stockpot and cover with 8 cups cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the chicken carcass or pieces and rinse under cold running water until the sediment and scum have washed away. Dump out the cooking liquid from the pot and give the pot a quick rinse. Return the chicken carcass or pieces to the pot and cover with 8 cups fresh water. Bring the stock to a full rolling boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Add the galanga root, lemongrass, lime leaves, garlic, shallot and chiles to the pot and simmer, skimming off any foam and fat often, about 1 1/2 hours.

Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes, and then remove the chicken from the pot. Set the chicken aside to cool briefly. Shred the chicken with 2 forks, reserving the bones. For the stock, return the bones to the pot and boil for 20 minutes. Remove the bones from the pot and discard. For the pot pie: When you&#39;re ready to use the Thyme Pastry, remove from the freezer and allow it to sit on the counter to thaw slightly, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Begin by finely dicing the vegetables. Slice the celery stalks into narrow strips, then slice in the other direction to create a fine dice. Repeat this process with the carrots, and the onion. Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots and celery. Saute until the vegetables start to turn translucent, a couple of minutes. Add 2 cups of the shredded chicken and stir to combine. Sprinkle the flour evenly over the vegetables and chicken, and stir to combine. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring gently. Pour in the chicken broth, stirring constantly. Stir in the bouillon cube and wine if using. The flour will combine with the chicken to create a delicious gravy. Next, add the peas. Pour in the cream and stir. Allow the mixture to cook over low heat, thickening gradually, about 4 minutes. Season with the thyme, salt and pepper, and remove from the heat. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. Be sure it&#39;s adequately salted! Pour the chicken mixture into a deep pie pan or small casserole dish. Roll out the pastry so that it&#39;s 1 inch larger than the pan. Place the crust on top of the chicken mixture and cut small slits in the top. Press the crust gently into the sides of the dish to seal. I don&#39;t worry about making a perfect edge on my chicken pot pie because a) it looks more rustic and b) I&#39;m lazy, hungry and I want to eat. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. To freeze: Allow the filling to cool completely then top with the crust. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place in the freezer. To cook from frozen: Remove the pot pie from the freezer, brush with egg wash (1 egg mixed with 2 tablespoons water or cream) and place directly in a 375-degree F oven and bake until lightly browned and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes. For the thyme pastry: Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Using pastry cutter, gradually work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. This step should take 3 or 4 minutes. Lightly beat the egg with a fork, and then add it to the mixture. Next, add in the cold water and vinegar. Stir the mixture together until it&#39;s just combined, and then remove half the dough from the bowl. (Dividing the dough in half results in two pretty generous pie crusts. If you desire a thinner crust, you may divide the dough into three crusts.) Place in a large plastic bag (do not seal) and slightly flatten with a rolling pin. This makes it much easier to roll out the crust later. After flattening, seal the bag tightly. Repeat with the other half of the dough and place the plastic bags in the freezer. I like to make several batches of pie crust at a time so I always have a crust ready to go. For recipes other than this pot pie, remove from the bag and place on a lightly floured surface. With a rolling pin, begin rolling the dough from the center, outward. Be gentle and patient; it&#39;ll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out. If you think the bottom is really sticking to the surface below, use a nice, sharp spatula to loosen it and sprinkle some extra flour on top. Then flip it over to finish rolling. Remember to roll from the center in single, outward strokes; no back-and-forth rolling. Again with a spatula, loosen and lift the pie crust and carefully lay it over a pie pan. Using your hand, lightly form the crust so that it fits inside the pan and overlaps the edges. Because it&#39;s quick and easy, I just tuck the excess dough under itself above the rim. Then you can apply whatever decorative effects that you like to the edge. Or you can leave it plain if you&#39;d like! Just tell yourself it&#39;s more rustic that way! Fill the pie crust with filling and bake according to the pie recipe&#39;s directions. Or, for a pre-baked crust, fill with pie weights (or pinto beans placed on aluminum foil) and bake at 400 degrees F until golden, about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71646,&quot;Mardi Gras Cocktail 2 cups pineapple juice 2 cups orange juice 4 maraschino cherries, plus 1/2 cup juice 1/2 orange, cut into 4 slices 4 ounces dark rum, optional Instructions: In a pitcher, stir together the pineapple juice, orange juice, and cherry juice.

Add the turkey and cook, breaking up chunks with the side of a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Push the turkey to the edges of the pan, leaving the middle empty. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil, then the onion and garlic to the center of the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin and coriander and stir about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and 1 teaspoon salt and stir until the paste begins to darken in color, about 30 seconds. Then add the squash, tomatoes and 4 cups water, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any stuck bits. Bring to a simmer, adjust the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the chili has thickened and the squash is tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Stir the beans and chia seeds into the chili and heat through, about 5 minutes. Season with an additional 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then taste the chili and stir in up to 2 tablespoons of vinegar.

Coat four 6-inch round cake pans with cooking spray; line with parchment paper. Combine the flour, granulated and brown sugars, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix thoroughly. In another bowl, mix together the sour cream, oil, milk, vanilla, eggs and egg yolks, then pour into the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed for 5 minutes. Adjust the mixer speed to low and add the hot water slowly until fully combined. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans and bake until the cakes spring back to the touch or a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 minutes. For the cookies-and-milk mousse filling: Combine the cream, cookies and pudding mix in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and mix on medium speed until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Continue mixing on high speed until peaks form and the mixture has a mousse consistency. To assemble the cake: Cut the domed top off of each cake round. Place one round on a serving plate. Using an offset spatula, spread an even layer of the filling on top. Repeat with the remaining layers until the cake is fully stacked. Coat the cake with American Buttercream, then apply fondant. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until fluffy. Add the powdered sugar, vanilla and water, and mix on low speed until blended. Increase the speed to medium and continue beating until white in color. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, then return the mixer to medium speed for 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 71649,&quot;Baby Artichokes with Aioli 3 lemons 24 baby artichokes (about 3 inches tall) 1 egg yolk* 2 cloves garlic Salt 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup neutral oil, such as regular olive oil or canola oil Instructions: Cut 2 of the lemons in half and squeeze the juice into a large bowl filled with cold water; drop squeezed lemon halves into water. Set bowl of lemon water next to your work area. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, remove the top few layers of dark green leaves, exposing the tender yellow leaves below. With a sharp paring knife, pare away the tough, fibrous outer layer around the base of the artichoke, then trim the tip of the artichoke off to flatten the top; you should still have about 2 inches of leaves above each heart. Drop each artichoke into the bowl of lemon water, as it is prepared (otherwise artichokes will darken).<br> To cook artichokes, place them on a rack in a pan above simmering water and steam, covered, until a knife slides easily through the base of the artichoke and leaves are tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove artichokes and plunge into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.<br> To make the aioli, juice the remaining lemon. In a blender, puree the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, the garlic, and a hefty pinch of salt. (If using a food processor, use a whole egg.) With machine running, gradually pour in the extra-virgin olive oil in a very thin, steady stream. Then pour in neutral oil in a thin stream. Do not rush it; if you pour oil too fast, mayonnaise won?t thicken. When all the oil is incorporated, transfer aioli to a serving bowl and season, to taste, with more lemon juice and salt. Serve at once with cooled artichokes. If made ahead, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate aioli and artichokes up to 1 day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 71650,&quot;Spring Veg Deviled Eggs 12 large hard cooked eggs 6 Tbsp. light sour cream 2 Tbsp French&#39;s?

In a small saucepan, heat the orange and lemon juices with 1/2 cup of the port. Add the zest and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Reserve. In a medium saucepan, combine the cranberries, onion, 2 cups port, ginger, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and cinnamon. Over medium-high heat, cook until the relish thickens, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup port, the orange liqueur, and the reserved orange and lemon juice and zest mixture. Set aside. Cut off the top 1/4-inch of each apple. Using a melon baller, remove the core of the apple, being careful not to pierce the sides or bottom of the apples, to make apple \\cups. Place the apple cups in a small baking dish. Spoon the cranberry relish into the apples. Spoon the excess relish around the apples. Cover with foil and bake until apples are tender, about 30 to 45 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71652,&quot;New York Steak with Madagascar Pepper and Port Wine 2 tablespoons whole white peppercorns 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns 6 entrecotes, 8 ounces each Kosher salt 2 tablespoons almond or safflower oil 1 cup port or dry sherry 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup brown veal stock 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 2 tablespoons pink peppercorns, soaked overnight in port 2 tablespoons green Madagascar peppercorns Instructions: With the back of a heavy saucepan, crush the white and black peppercorns. Remove all fat from the entrecotes. Season with salt and crushed peppercorns. Heat a large heavy saucepan. Pour in oil, and over high heat, cook the entrecotes 4 minutes on each side (for medium rare). Transfer meat to a warm platter and reserve. Pour out oil from the pan, deglaze with port, and reduce.

Ladle sauce over steaks and divide remaining peppercorns equally over each portion. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 71653,&quot;Sauteed Pork Tenderloin Medallions 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil 16 ounce pork tenderloin, trimmed of fat; silverskin removed and cut into 3/4inch medallions 2 scallions, thinly sliced into rounds 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 2 large tomatoes, seeded and chopped (3 cups) Salt and crushed red pepper Instructions: In a large skillet heat the oil. Add the medallions and saute them over high heat for 2 minutes a side to brown them. Lower the heat and continue to cook slowly for about 5 minutes or until just cooked through. Don&#39;t overcook or they will toughen. When done, remove the medallions to a serving plate. To the remaining oil add the cumin, turmeric and tomatoes and stir for a few seconds just to heat the tomatoes; season to taste with salt and crushed red pepper and spoon over the medallions. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Barbera, Garnacha]&quot; 71654,&quot;Caramelized Onions with Thyme 4 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 large yellow onions 3 large red onions Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only Instructions: Heat the butter and olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or pan set over medium-high heat. Peel and slice the onions into rounds while the butter is melting and add them to the pot. Toss to coat the onions and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Turn the heat down to medium and do not cover the pot. You want these babies to get brown! Stir occasionally, for about 10 to 15 minutes, then turn the heat to medium-low. Keep stirring (switch to a spatula or wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits) until the onions are browned and soft. Add the thyme leaves, toss and remove from the heat. These will keep for 5 days in a covered bowl in the refrigerator. Use the leftovers with eggs, on top of a salad, or straight from the bowl with a fork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71655,&quot;Smoked Salmon Pinwheels 8 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons diced red onion 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves 8 ounces sliced smoked salmon (we recommend Nova, but you make use the saltier lox) 2 tablespoons small capers, drained 1 seedless cucumber, with peel, sliced into rounds the size of crackers Instructions: Combine the cream cheese, lemon juice, red onion, and basil in a bowl until completely blended. On a piece of waxed paper, arrange the smoked salmon slices in a rectangle about 3 inches wide and 12 inches long, slightly overlapping each piece. (If the salmon slices are cut irregularly, simply piece them together like a puzzle.)

Add half of the butter and pulse until combined. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add 1/4 cup ice water; pulse a few more times until the dough just holds together when pinched (add up to 1 more tablespoon ice water if needed). Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap; press into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, about 8 minutes. Let cool completely; set aside. Set another baking sheet on the middle oven rack. Put the dates in a small bowl and cover with 1/2 cup boiling water; set aside 5 minutes. Transfer the dates with their soaking liquid to a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until smooth. Add the pumpkin puree, corn syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, flour and cinnamon; pulse until smooth. Add the heavy cream and eggs; pulse until just combined. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate, pressing the dough into the bottom and up the side. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers or a fork. Refrigerate 15 minutes. Sprinkle 3/4 cup of the toasted pecans in the prepared crust and add the filling. Transfer to the hot baking sheet in the oven and bake until the filling is set around the edge but the center still jiggles, about 1 hour. Transfer to a rack and let cool. Make the toffee sauce: Bring the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, heavy cream and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until dark and thick, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool 3 minutes. Pour the warm toffee sauce over the pie and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup toasted pecans on top. Let sit until the toffee sauce sets, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 71658,&quot;Stuffed Swordfish 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon finely minced garlic 1/4 pound peeled and deveined finely chopped shrimp 1 to 2 tablespoons white wine 1/2 cup or so soft fresh bread crumbs 1/2 ounce grated or finely sliced mozzarella cheese 2 teaspoons rinsed capers, chopped 2 to 4 basil leaves, scissored into threads Salt and pepper 12 ounces swordfish cut into 6 thin slices Lemon wedges for garnish 4 pitted black olives, sliced Instructions: In a small skillet heat the olive oil.

Bring to a boil, season with salt and cook until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the hot pot. While the potatoes are cooking, add the bacon to a medium skillet and cook over medium heat until crisp. With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat from the skillet. Add the onions and garlic to the bacon fat and cook for a few minutes. Add the mustard and coriander seeds and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the apples and cook for 3 more minutes. Sprinkle in the brown sugar, add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for a couple minutes, stirring to dissolve the sugar. In a small bowl, whisk together the cider vinegar and grainy mustard, and then slowly whisk in the canola oil. Add the onion-apple mixture and the vinaigrette to the hot pot of drained potatoes. Set aside until cool to allow the potatoes to absorb all the flavors. Season the potato salad with salt and pepper, then add the crisp bacon and the celery and parsley. Toss well. For the sausage: In a large bowl, combine the pork shoulder, short rib, fatback, parsley, salt, red wine vinegar, sugar, celery seed, granulated garlic, granulated onion, nutmeg, caraway, coriander, dry mustard, paprika, black pepper and some salt. Run the mixture through a meat grinder fitted with the die with the largest holes (see Cook&#39;s Note). Repeat so that all of the meat goes through the grinder twice. Mix in the Swiss cheese and up to 1/4 cup cold water as needed. Attach the sausage-stuffing attachment to the meat grinder, keeping the grinder blade and die in place. Place a generous amount of the prepared sausage mixture in the grinder pan. Give the casings a slight bit of resistance by holding onto the sausage stuffer with your last three fingers and letting the casing slip through your thumb and forefinger. Turn the machine on and fill the casings, being careful to avoid any air bubbles. Twist the casings to create 5-inch sausages that are even in size. Tie each sausage with butcher&#39;s twine to keep them nicely sealed. Prick the sausages all over with a pin or skewer to vent steam during cooking. Place the sausage links in boiling water and parboil for 10 to 15 minutes. Slice the sausages in half lengthwise and saute until browned in a preheated saute pan slicked with olive oil. For the thousand island sauce: Combine the sour cream, ketchup, relish, Worcestershire and some salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir to blend. To assemble the sandwich: Spread a pretzel bun, top and bottom, with thousand island sauce and then with brown mustard. Add sauerkraut and sausage halves to the bottom bun and cover with the bun top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 71669,&quot;Chocolate-Almond Torte 1 1/4 cups blanched, sliced almonds 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced, plus more for greasing 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3 large eggs, separated, plus 3 egg yolks Grated zest of 1 orange 1 tablespoon dark rum 1/2 teaspoon salt Confectioners&#39; sugar, for garnish Whipped cream, for garnish (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Oil 2 rimmed baking sheets with olive oil. In a large bowl, combine the pork, beef, bread crumbs, pork fat, prosciutto, parsley, 1 tablespoon of the salt, oregano, fennel seeds, and chili flakes and mix with your hands just until all of the ingredients are evenly distributed. Set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the ricotta, eggs, and milk just enough to break up any large curds of ricotta. Add the ricotta mixture to the ground meat mixture and mix lightly with your hands just until incorporated. The mixture should feel wet and tacky. Pinch off a small nugget of the mixture, flatten it into a disk, and cook it in a small saute pan. Taste it and adjust the seasoning of the mixture with salt, if needed. Form the mixture into balls each weighing about 2 ounces and 1-inch in diameter, and place on the prepared baking sheets. You should have about 30 meatballs. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the meatballs are browned. Remove from the oven and lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Sprinkle the tomatoes with the remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and then pass the tomatoes and their juices through a food mill fitted with the medium plate. Alternatively, you put the entire can of tomatoes in a large bowl, don an apron, and then squeeze the tomatoes into small pieces with your hands. Pack the meatballs into 1 large roasting pan or 2 smaller roasting pans. Pour the tomato sauce over the meatballs, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and braise for 1 to 2 hours, or until the meatballs are tender and have absorbed some of the tomato sauce. Pull the pans out of the oven and uncover. Distribute the basil leaves throughout the sauce. For each serving, ladle meatballs with some of the sauce into a warmed bowl. Grate grana over the top, drizzle with olive oil to finish, and serve immediately.

Mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sour cream, milk, eggs, salt and melted butter. Bake in a greased loaf pan for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown and when a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Let cool in pan. Let oven temperature reduce to 400 degrees F. For the Turkey: Rinse turkey breast and pat dry with paper towels. Slip chunks of butter under the skin. Season turkey breast with garlic powder, salt and pepper, to taste, and roast in 400 degrees F oven until it reaches an internal temperature of about 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. For the Dressing: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute sausage until browned. Remove to a utility platter with a slotted spoon and pour most of the fat from the pan leaving about 1 tablespoon. Melt butter in the skillet over medium heat. Saute onion, garlic, celery, parsley, sage and thyme until onion is translucent, being careful not to burn them. Remove from heat and set aside briefly. Cut cornbread into cubes or break it up with your hands into a large bowl (depending on the texture you like). Spoon the sauteed vegetables and herbs over the cornbread. Stir or use your hands to combine well and add enough chicken stock to moisten. Transfer to a baking pan and place in the oven until crispy on the outside, for approximately the last 25 minutes of the turkey&#39;s roasting time. Remove from oven and transfer to a serving dish in a warm place. For the Gravy: When turkey is done, remove breast to a platter to let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Skim most of the fat from the pan juices, reserving 1/3 cup of the fat. Add wine to the remaining pan juices and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by half. In a separate saucepan, heat reserved 1/3 cup of fat and whisk in flour over moderately-low heat for a few minutes to make a roux. Add chicken stock and reduced wine, continuing to cook until gravy simmers. Slice turkey and arrange on plate.

In a separate, small bowl, whisk together the water, eggs, vanilla, and oil until thoroughly combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with the dough hook on low to medium speed until a dough starts to form. Continue to knead on medium speed for 10 to 12 minutes, scraping the sides as necessary, until the dough is smooth, soft, slightly sticky, and elastic. (Alternatively, you can combine everything in a large mixing bowl and then knead by hand for 12 to 15 minutes or until the dough is smooth and soft. Add flour if it gets too sticky but not too much). Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic or a clean towel, and place in a warm place until doubled in size (depending on the temperature in the room it takes around 1 to 1.5 hours). For the filling: Combine granulated sugar, flour, espresso powder, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl and set aside. To form the wreath: hen dough has doubled, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 24-inch by 12-inch rectangle. Drizzle over the butter and use a pastry brush to evenly spread over the surface of the dough, leaving a clean ?-inch border on the top and bottom. Sprinkle the filling mixture over the dough in an even layer, again leaving a clean ?-inch border on the top and bottom. Using a pizza cutter or knife, divide the dough in half the long way. Starting from the inside to the outer edge, roll each side up into a tight roll and pinch to seal. Arrange the rolls so they\\u2019re seam-side down. Braid the two strands together and place on the prepared baking sheet. Connect the ends to form a wreath. Cover with plastic or a clean towel and allow to rise until doubled in size, about an hour. Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the egg with a splash of cold water and brush the top of the wreath. Sprinkle with pearl sugar or turbinado sugar. Bake until the wreath is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. Begin checking at 30 minutes. Allow to cool and sprinkle with powdered sugar, if using. Tear apart and eat. This is best on its first day but would make really good French toast on day 2 or 3. Store at room temperature in an airtight plastic bag or container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71675,&quot;Big-Batch Healthy Beef, Mushroom and Spinach Calzones 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound lean ground beef Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced (about 1 cup) 4 cloves garlic, finely minced 6 cups packed baby spinach (about 5 ounces) One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes 3 pounds whole-wheat or regular pizza dough Cooking spray Whole wheat or all-purpose flour, for the work surface 2 1/4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella 1 large egg, beaten Instructions: Set a pizza stone or baking sheet on an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven, and preheat to 425 degrees F. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, 3/4 teaspoon salt and half the pepper flakes, and cook, breaking the beef up into large chunks with a wooden spoon, until the beef is browned all over, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, 2/3 of the garlic and 3/4 teaspoon salt, and cook for 3 minutes more. Fold in the spinach, and cook until wilted, about 1 minute (the mixture should be relatively dry). Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and let cool completely. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining oil, garlic and pepper flakes to the skillet, and cook, stirring, to lightly brown the garlic, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and 3/4 teaspoon salt, and simmer the sauce until thick, about 6 minutes; set aside. Divide the pizza dough into 12 balls. Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. On a well-floured surface, roll out each ball into a 6- or 7-inch circle 1/8 inch thick. On the bottom half of each circle, mound 1/4 cup of the cooled beef mixture and top with 3 tablespoons of the mozzarella. Fold over the top half of the dough to form a semicircle, and pinch the edges to seal. Carefully transfer the calzones with a spatula to the prepared baking sheets. Lightly brush with the beaten egg. Cut 2 small slits on top of each to vent steam. Refrigerate half the calzones. With a spatula, transfer the rest of the calzones to the hot pizza stone or baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 22 minutes. Repeat with the remaining calzones. Reheat the tomato sauce, and serve on the side. To freeze: Let the baked calzones cool completely, then wrap each one tightly in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil. Place them in freezer bags, and freeze for up to a month. The sauce can be frozen in 12 small freezer bags for up to a month. To reheat: Thaw the frozen calzones in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours. Unwrap the calzones, then microwave them on a microwave-safe plate in 1-minute increments, rotating them after each, until heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. To reheat the sauce, microwave it in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until the sauce is hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 71676,&quot;Crispy Chicken Spinach Salad 2? pounds Tyson?

Whisk the batter until smooth. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Make 12 pancakes about 5 1/2-inches in diameter. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Warm the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onions, carrots, and garlic and saute until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach, tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large bowl. Add the basil, 1/4 cup Parmesan, and mascarpone cheese. Stir the mixture until well mixed. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9 by 12-inch baking dish (or individual baking dishes). Using about half the vegetable mixture fill the pancakes. Lay pancake down on a work surface, top with 2 spoonfuls of vegetable mixture, sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Roll up the pancake around the vegetable mixture and place in the baking dish. Continue with the remaining pancakes, placing in the baking dish in 2 rows, and using up all the shredded mozzarella cheese. Place the remaining vegetable mixture in a blender with 1/2 cup whole milk. Blend until smooth adding up to 1/4 cup more milk if necessary to make a sauce. Pour the sauce over the center of the vegetable-stuffed pancakes in two rows. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.

Mix together, then add the raspberries. The raspberries will dominate the flavor. If you want apricot-flavored Pate de Fruit, omit the raspberries. Using a hand-held immersion blender or whisk, combine all of the ingredients until smooth and homogenous. As the mixture cooks, the natural pectin in the fruit will cause the mixture to thicken. Continue to cook until it is thick, mixing constantly. To test for the correct consistency, dip a whisk in the mixture and hold horizontally in front of you. Watch as the mixture drips off the whisk and back into the pan. If the mixture stays on the whisk and beads up into small balls, like pearls, it is ready. If it drips back into the pan in thin strands, it needs to be cooked a little longer. When the mixture is a bit thicker than jam, pour it into a spouted container. Fill either a half-dome or triangle shaped flexipan, depending on the desired design of the jewels and let rest for 4 hours at room temperature. When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar. If you do not have a flexipan, you can pour the Pate de Fruit into a 10-inch bottomless tart mold or cake ring placed on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Let the Pate de Fruit cool and set, about 3 hours at room temperature. When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar. To unmold, run a sharp paring knife between the fruit and the mold and lift off the mold. (At this point the Pate de Fruit can be stored, well wrapped in plastic and in an airtight container, for up to 2 months.) Sprinkle the top of the Pate de Fruit with a thin layer of sugar and flip it onto another sheet of parchment paper. Remove the parchment that is now on top. Sprinkle this side with more sugar. Using a wet chef&#39;s knife or cutter, cut the Pate de Fruit into any shapes. Roll each piece completely in sugar and serve. Do not store in the refrigerator, as the humidity will make the sugar melt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 71708,&quot;Pizza Party at Home 1 1/4 cups lukewarm water (100 degrees F) 1 packet (2 1/2 teaspoons) dry active yeast 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting<br> 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus additional for greasing<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Basic tomato sauce, for serving Fresh mozzarella, for serving Grilled chicken, for serving<br> Roasted broccoli, zucchini or mushrooms, for serving Sliced prosciutto, for serving Cherry tomatoes, for serving<br> Extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, for serving Bacon and Sweet Onion Marmalade, recipe follows Grated Parmesan, for serving Baby arugula, for serving<br> 8 ounces sliced bacon 4 cups thinly sliced yellow onion (about 2 large onions) 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 2 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1/4 cup sherry vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> Instructions: For the pizza dough: Combine the warm water and yeast in a small bowl and whisk to dissolve.

Grease a clean bowl with olive oil and transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and set aside on the countertop for 45 minutes. Place a pizza stone or ovenproof nonstick pan in the oven and preheat the oven to 550 degrees F. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Punch the dough down by pressing the air out of it with floured hands. Gently knead the dough and divide it into 2 pieces. Roll 1 piece of dough into a ball under the palm of your hand, then roll it into a flat disc with a rolling pin. Finish stretching the dough by hand. Repeat with the remaining ball of dough. The pizzas are now ready to top. Spread tomato sauce evenly on the pizza crusts. Slice the mozzarella into thin pieces and distribute evenly on top of the sauce. Add the chicken, vegetables, prosciutto and cherry tomatoes and drizzle with oil and vinegar. Spoon on the Bacon and Sweet Onion Marmalade and sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake each pizza until bubbling and the crust is golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Let cool for 3 minutes, top with arugula and serve. Cut the bacon into pieces small pieces and add to a large saute pan. Cook over medium heat until the bacon is browned, but not completely crisp. Add the onions, thyme and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring often, until very tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain any fat that remains in the pan and deglaze with the vinegar. Scrape all the fond (the browned bits) from the bottom of the pan and stir in the sugar. Continue cooking until the pan is dry. Set aside to cool. The marmalade may be stored, covered in the refrigerator, up to 3 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 71709,&quot;Tart Tropezienne 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar 3/4 -ounce fresh yeast 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk 5 large eggs, plus 1 egg, beaten, for egg wash 1 teaspoon salt 1 stick plus 4 1/2 tablespoons butter Rock sugar 2 cups milk 1 plump, moist vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped 6 large egg yolks 3/4 cup sugar 1/3 cup sifted cornstarch 3 sticks butter, softened 1 tablespoon orange water 1 tablespoon kirsch 1 1/2 cups whipped heavy cream Instructions: Brioche: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, sugar, and yeast on low speed using the dough hook attachment. Add milk, 5 eggs, and salt, mixing until the dry ingredients become moistened. Increase mixer speed and beat until the dough comes together. Slowly add butter, and continue mixing until the dough detaches from the side and bottom of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a separate bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rest in a warm place until it almost doubles in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Gently deflate the dough; press a piece of plastic wrap against its surface to prevent a skin from forming, and refrigerate for 6 hours. After refrigeration is complete, using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut the dough into an 8-inch diameter, and place on a baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm place. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap from the risen dough and gently apply a coat of egg wash. Sprinkle some rock sugar over the top. Place on a baking sheet and bake for approximately 12 to 15 minutes, or until the dough is puffed and golden. Transfer the dough to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature. Cream: In a small saucepan, bring milk and vanilla bean to a gentle boil over medium heat. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the yolks, sugar, and cornstarch. Whisking all the while, very slowly drizzle a quarter of the hot milk into the yolks. Still whisking, pour the yolk mixture into the saucepan, and over high heat, whisk vigorously without stopping and bring to a boil. Boil for about 1 to 2 minutes, and then transfer to a large bowl. Keep stirring until the mixture reaches 100 to 120 degrees F, or slightly warmer than room temperature. Add softened butter, orange water, and kirsch.

Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, rosemary, pepper flakes and walnuts. Toast until fragrant and beginning to brown. Add the chopped spinach and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and cook until wilted. Stir in the raisins. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the lamb out flat, fat-side down, on a board in front of you. If it is still very thick, gently pound it to an even, 1-inch thickness. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and the 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spread evenly with the mustard; distribute the spinach mixture over the mustard. Starting from one side, roll up the lamb with the filling inside so that it maintains the shape of the leg. Tie with butcher&#39;s twine at 2-inch intervals. Season the outside with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Wipe out the saute pan and add the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Place the pan over high heat and allow it to get hot. Place the lamb in the pan and sear it on all sides until golden brown all over, about two minutes per side. Transfer the lamb to a rimmed baking sheet or a roasting pan and roast until the internal temperature registers 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove to a cutting board and rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing. While the lamb is roasting, prepare the gremolata: In a small saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the panko and cook, stirring regularly, until golden brown. Add the parsley, lemon zest, pepper flakes and salt. Toss and set aside to let the flavors mingle. Serve the sliced lamb with a sprinkling of the breadcrumb gremolata. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 71729,&quot;Red, White, and Blue Cherry Pies 1 package double pie crust mix 1 (20-ounce) can cherry pie filling 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 2 tablespoons milk 2 teaspoons sugar 1 pint fresh blueberries, reserve 1/4 cup for garnish 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons water 2 cups vanilla ice cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Stir well, then add the onions, paprika, remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally (more frequently toward the end), until the onions are golden and very tender, about 30 minutes, reducing the heat to medium during the last 10 minutes so the onions don\\u2019t burn. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs for al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cups cooking water, then drain. Add the pasta, 3/4 cup cooking water, the sour cream and vinegar to the mushroom-onion mixture.

When the shallots are translucent, add the clams, white wine, thyme and bay leaves. Cover the pot to steam the clams, and as they begin to open, add the mussels. Simmer gently, covered, to open the mussels and remaining clams, about 3 minutes. When all the shells are open, strain off the liquid and reserve, setting aside the shellfish to cool slightly until you can handle them. Shuck the meat out of all the shells, refrigerate and reserve for the sauce. Discard the vegetables and herbs. For the sauce: Cook the bacon in the same pot over medium heat to render the fat. This will help to make the roux later. When the bacon begins to brown, add 3 tablespoons of the butter, the garlic and shallots. Continue to sweat over medium heat until the shallots are translucent. Add the white wine and reduce until it&#39;s almost dry (au sec). Add the reserved shellfish stock and reduce by half. Remove from the heat and set aside on the stove. Melt the remaining 1 stick butter in a separate small pot or deep saute pan to its bubbling point and stir in the flour very well with a wooden spoon, incorporating it while removing clumps. Cook 3 to 5 minutes over medium heat while stirring regularly. Add the roux to the bacon pan, and replace over medium heat. Add the cold milk to the hot roux while stirring constantly. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. You will have to monitor it carefully and stir frequently so the flour doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom (if it does, don&#39;t panic! You can remove the sauce, clean the bottom of the pot and put it back in... phew!) Simmer 10 minutes, then add the carrots, celery and fennel, and continue cooking until the raw flour taste has been cooked out and the vegetables are tender (they will add texture to the finished chowder), 10 minutes longer. Add the reserved mussels and clams. I use trim from the other fish I cook every day. Simmer 1 minute to heat through and add the parsley. Season with salt and serve immediately.

Place the compound butter on a piece of plastic wrap and roll it in a tube shape about 2-inches in diameter, twisting the ends to secure. Place it in the freezer until completely solid, at least 3 hours. Divide the chicken into four 8-ounce patties. Remove the log of compound butter from the freezer and place it in the center of the chicken. Wrap the chicken around the compound butter and seal to form it tightly and evenly around--like a large egg shape. For the breading: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place a rack on top of a baking sheet. Set up a dredging station with the flour, beaten eggs, seasoned Italian breadcrumbs and panko. Season each with 2 tablespoons salt and 1 tablespoon pepper. Dredge the chicken lightly in the flour, egg, then Italian breadcrumbs. Pass the chicken back through the egg and then finally in the panko for a second coating. Place on the prepared rack. Fill a pot with 2 to 3 inches of oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the chicken until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place the chicken back on the rack and bake until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Let the chicken rest for 1 to 2 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 71761,&quot;Sandy&#39;s Potato Salad 5 pounds white boiling potatoes, cooked, diced and cooled 4 to 5 hardboiled eggs, finely chopped 1 cup chopped celery 1/2 cup sweet pickle relish 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 2 cups mayonnaise 2 tablespoons brown mustard 2 tablespoons sugar Salt and pepper Instructions: Place the potatoes in a large bowl.

In another bowl mix bread crumbs, melted butter, milk, eggs, baking powder, sugar and salt. Combine the bread crumb mixture with the cranberry mixture. Spoon the batter into the prepared mold, a little at a time, tapping the mold as it is filled to eliminate any air bubbles. Cover the mold tightly with a lid and tie with a towel wrung out in cold water and floured. Tie a knot at the top of the towel to facilitate removal of the mold from the kettle. Set a rack in the bottom of a kettle and add enough simmering water to reach 3 inches up the sides of the mold. Transfer the mold to the kettle. Keep the water at a brisk but not a rolling boil on the stove top. Cover the kettle with a lid. Steam the pudding for 2 hours, checking occasionally to make certain the water remains at a boil, adding more water throughout the cooking process as necessary. To test for doneness, insert a skewer in the center of the pudding. It should come out with crumbs adhering to it. Return the lid to the mold and transfer it to a rack. The pudding will stay warm in the mold, covered, for several hours. To make the glaze combine cranberry juice, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Simmer the juice, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil and swirl gently until a candy thermometer reads 250 degrees. Add whole cranberries and remove the pan from the heat.

Put the flour, baking powder, salt and garlic powder in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Add the cold butter and pulse until the dry ingredients and the butter are mostly combined. (If you do not have a food processor, this can be done with a pastry cutter.) Add the Parmesan, parsley, oregano and thyme. Drizzle in the milk and pulse (or stir in with a wooden spoon) until the mixture has just turned into a dough. Be careful not to overmix, as the biscuits will become tough when baked if you do. Using 2 large spoons, drop 1/2-cup sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. This will make 6 generously sized biscuits. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes, depending on your oven. Brush the warm biscuits with the melted butter. Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 71773,&quot;Lobster Roll 1 cup white wine 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 large shallot, chopped 1 bay leaf 1 sprig fresh tarragon 1 sprig fresh thyme 1/2 cup half-and-half 1 pound cold sweet cream butter, medium dice Lemon juice Kosher salt Kosher salt 4 lobsters (1 1/2 pounds each) 4 brioche hot dog buns Salted butter, as needed to toast the buns Mayo Mustard, recipe follows 1 tablespoon whole-fat yogurt 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 2 lemons, quartered 3/4 teaspoon dried mustard, such as Coleman&#39;s Mustard Powder 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1/4 cup mayo 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Dash hot sauce, such as Tabasco Kosher salt Instructions: For the lobster sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, reduce the white wine and tarragon vinegar with the peppercorns, shallots, bay leaf, tarragon and thyme until the mixture is nearly dry, about 10 minutes. Add the half-and-half and reduce by two-thirds, about 5 minutes.<br> Decrease the heat to low and whisk in the butter, chunk by chunk, stirring vigorously until each piece is nearly melted. Remove the lobster sauce from the heat and season it with lemon juice and salt. Strain the lobster sauce through a fine mesh chinois. Hold the lobster sauce warm in a saucepan over very low heat until the lobster meat is ready.<br> For the lobsters: Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Prepare a bath of icy water. Kill the lobsters by placing them on their backs on a cutting board and inserting a knife tip into their heads between the antennae. Drop the lobsters in the boiling water for 20 seconds and immediately shock them in the ice bath to stop the cooking. Extract the tail, claw and knuckle meat from the lobsters. The meat will still be translucent and raw. Remove the mud line from the tails and dice the tail meat into bite-size chunks.<br> Add the lobster meat to the lobster sauce. Very slowly warm the meat until it is just barely cooked through. Be sure to agitate the pan frequently to prevent the lobster sauce from breaking. If it does start to break, sprinkle it with a few drops of cold water and take it off the heat for a moment.<br> For the lobster rolls: In a saute pan, toast the sides of the buns with butter until crispy and golden. Spoon the cooked lobster meat into the prepared buns. Add as much lobster sauce as desired. Drizzle the lobster rolls with Mayo Mustard, drizzle with yogurt and sprinkle liberally with chives. Serve with lemon wedges. Combine the dried mustard with 1 1/2 teaspoons water and lemon juice. Whisk in the mayo, Dijon, hot sauce and salt to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71774,&quot;Balsamic-Glazed Turkey One 12- to 14-pound turkey Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Four 1-inch-wide strips lemon zest 1 medium onion, quartered 2 heads garlic, halved Several sprigs fresh rosemary Several sprigs fresh sage Several sprigs fresh thyme Olive oil, for the turkey 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter 1 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: Position an oven rack in the lowest position and remove the other racks; preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.\\u202f Remove any turkey parts from the neck and breast cavities and reserve for another use if desired. Dry the turkey well with paper towels inside and out. Sprinkle the inside with salt and pepper and stuff with the lemon zest, onion, 1 head of the garlic and half of the rosemary, sage and thyme. Set the turkey on a roasting rack set in a roasting pan breast-side up. Rub the outside of the turkey with olive oil, then sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Put the chicken broth, 1 stick of the butter, 1 cup water and the remaining rosemary, sage, thyme and head of garlic in the bottom of the pan. Tent the turkey with foil. Roast the turkey, basting thoroughly every 30 minutes, for 2 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, heat the balsamic vinegar, honey and remaining stick of butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is simmering. Continue to simmer until thick, syrupy and reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Set aside. After roasting the turkey for 2 1/2 hours, remove the foil and increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Roast the turkey for another 15 minutes, then baste with about a third of the balsamic glaze using a pastry brush. Roast for another 10 minutes, then glaze again with half of the remaining glaze. Roast for another 10 minutes, then glaze a final time with the remaining glaze. Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 10 minutes more. Let the turkey rest for 15 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71775,&quot;Pomodori con l&#39;Uva (Tomatoes with Grape Juice) 1 small bunch dark grapes (about 1 cup) 1 to 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, if needed 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup yellow cornmeal Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 6 firm but almost ripe tomatoes, sliced 1/2-inch thick Olive oil, as needed 2 cloves garlic, smashed Instructions: Puree the grapes in a blender, then strain the juices into a bowl. Season with balsamic vinegar if the grapes are too sweet. Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, pepper, and rosemary on a plate, mixing well. Dip the tomato slices into the mixture, coating on both sides. Pour a little olive oil into a large nonstick frying pan, just enough to create a film on the bottom. Add the garlic and place over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the tomato slices and cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, about 6 minutes total. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and using a spatula, transfer to a serving plate. Pour the grape juices over hot tomatoes. Serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 71776,&quot;Spicy Fried Chicken Drumettes 12 (11/4 pounds) chicken drumettes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup buttermilk 2 tablespoons curry powder 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs 2 teaspoons smoked paprika 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for frying Kosher salt, for seasoning Instructions: Chicken: Season the chicken on all sides with salt and pepper, to taste, and put in a 1-gallon size resealable plastic bag. In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, curry powder and cayenne pepper until smooth. Pour the buttermilk mixture over the chicken and seal the bag. Refrigerate for 3 hours. Breading: In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, bread crumbs, paprika, salt, and pepper. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour in enough oil to fill the pan about 1/3 of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 325 degrees F. (If you dont have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 2 minutes.) Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off, and dredge in the flour mixture. Fry, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, until golden and cooked through, about 6 to 7 minutes, depending on the size of the drumettes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.

Place a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle lightly with flour and knead gently, removing any large air bubbles. Knead into a small circle, then shape into a tight ball, pinching the seams together underneath. Place on a well-floured board or baking peel, seam-side down. Cover with a kitchen towels and let rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat a baking stone, if available, on the bottom rack of an oven at 400 degrees F. With a sharp, serrated knife, cut a large \\X\\ or cross-hatch pattern into the top of the dough. Spray lightly with a mister and transfer to the baking stone (or place on a heavy baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal) and bake until golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom, about 60 minutes. (Sourdough should have a darker crust than other breads, so leave in the oven 5 minutes after you think it is done.) Remove the loaf from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving. In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit until the yeast becomes foamy, about 5 minutes. (If the yeast does not foam, discard the mixture and begin again with a new yeast.) Add the flour and stir vigorously to work air into the mixture. Cover with a towel let rest in a warm, draft-free place (an oven with its pilot light or light bulb turned on works well) for 8 to12 hours. (The mixture should become very bubbly.) Use immediately or cover loosely with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. Preserving the Starter: Each time you remove a portion of the starter for a recipe, reserve at least 1/4 cup and replace the amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water. For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter, you must replace it with 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water. Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not completely smooth, cover loosely, and return to the refrigerator. Also, the starter must be maintained by feeding it every few days. Refresh by removing 1 cup of the starter (give to a friend or discard it) and adding 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water. Whisk until blended but not smooth. Cover loosely and return to the refrigerator. If you plan to be away longer than a week, freeze the starter in a sterilized, airtight freezer container. Thaw the starter 2 days before you plan to bake with it. Refresh as indicated above with 1 cup each of flour and warm water. Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or overnight before using. CAUTION: Never keep your starter tightly closed! The gasses expelled by the yeast will build up pressure and may cause the container (such as a glass jar) to burst!

Set the dressing aside. To make the salad, combine the bell pepper, cucumber, onion, chickpeas, olives, walnuts, mint and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in 3 tablespoons of salt and a small splash of olive oil. Add the orzo and cook for 7 to 9 minutes, or according to the directions on the package. Drain the orzo in a colander, then add it to the vegetable mixture while the orzo is still hot. Immediately pour the dressing onto the orzo and vegetables, and stir to combine. The hot orzo will readily absorb the dressing. Add a splash more olive oil if the salad seems too dry. Allow the salad to cool to room temperature, and add the feta, if desired. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Give the salad a stir, then taste and adjust the seasoning before serving, if need be. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 71780,&quot;Bacon, Egg and Cheese \\Toaster Tarts<br> 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 3 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1/4 cup ice water, plus 2 tablespoons more if needed 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3/4 cup milk 1 large egg yolk 3/4 cup shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the crust: Pulse the flour, shortening, sugar, vinegar and fine salt in a food processor until the mixture looks like a fine meal. Add the butter, and pulse until it is in pea-sized pieces. With the motor running, stream in 1/4 cup ice water, and continue processing until the dough begins to come together, about 15 seconds. If there&#39;s still unincorporated flour, add up to 2 more tablespoons ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, running the processor continuously until the dough forms a smooth satiny ball, about 30 seconds more. Remove the dough ball, and place it on a piece of plastic wrap. Use the wrap to mold the dough into a brick shape, approximately 8 by 2 inches by 1 inch thick. Wrap the dough in the plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. For the filling: Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a medium bowl. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the skillet, and return the skillet to medium heat. Whisk in the flour, and cook, whisking constantly, until light brown, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the milk, and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 1 minute more. Transfer the flour-milk mixture to the bowl with the cooked bacon. Add the egg yolk, Cheddar-Jack, Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper, and stir to combine. To assemble: Position 2 oven racks in the top and bottom third of the oven, and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Cut the dough crosswise into sixteen 1/2-inch-wide rectangles. Flour a work surface and a rolling pin. Working with one rectangle at a time, roll the dough to about 4 1/2 inches by 2 1/2 inches by 1/8 inch (1 roll lengthwise with the pin and 1 roll crosswise ought to do it, then use hands to shape the dough into a rectangle). Divide the 16 dough rectangles between the 2 prepared baking sheets. Place about 2 teaspoons of filling at the center of each of 8 rectangles, and spread with an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with the remaining 8 rectangles. Crimp the edges together with a fork to seal. Brush the top of each tart with the beaten egg, prick with the fork 8 times and sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt. Bake the tarts until the dough is golden brown, 22 to 24 minutes, reversing the baking sheets top to bottom halfway through. Let the tarts cool on the baking sheets until cool enough to touch, about 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 71781,&quot;Brunchtime Salad with Creamy Raspberry Vinaigrette 1 (16-ounce) package pre-cut fruit 1 (5-ounce) bag spring salad mix 1/2 cup Italian dressing 1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt 1/3 cup frozen raspberries, thawed 1/4 cup slivered almonds, for garnish Instructions: Arrange salad mix on a serving platter.

Add the poblanos, and cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until the skin is blackened and blistered on all sides, about 5 to 7 minutes depending of the size of the poblanos. Remove from the griddle as they are done and place in a plastic bag, let sit for 5 minutes, until the skins are soft enough to be easily removed. Remove the poblanos from the bag, and using your fingers and small sharp knife, peel and scrape off as much of the blackened skin as possible, (a few black specks don&#39;t matter). Leave the tops on and cut small (2 to 3-inch) lengthwise slits in the polios and carefully pull out the seeds without tearing the flesh. Add all the sauce ingredients to a blender and process until thoroughly pureed. Set aside art room temperature or keep in refrigerator until ready to serve. In a medium-size skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring often. Add the tomato, cilantro and cook for another minute. Add the meat and cook stirring, until the meat is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Add the potatoes, cook for 2 minutes, then stir in the black currants and the almonds. Remove from the heat. Carefully stuff the mixture into the chiles through the slit, taking care not to rip the chiles. Transfer the stuffed poblanos to a serving platter. Cover with the walnut sauce and garnish with pomegranate seeds and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 71783,&quot;Breakfast Tarts 6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surface 1 1/3 cups sugar 2 teaspoons ground cardamom or nutmeg 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 pound (4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cubed 3/4 cup vegetable shortening 3/4 cup ice-cold water 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 cups fresh blueberries 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup lemon juice 5 tablespoons cornstarch 1 cup water 1 egg, beaten Milk, for brushing Instructions: For the tart crust: Mix the flour, sugar, cardamom and salt in a food processor. Add the butter and shortening, and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Drizzle in the ice water and vanilla, and pulse until the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and form into a ball. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. For the blueberry compote: While the dough is resting, place the blueberries, sugar and lemon juice in a pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the cornstarch and water, stirring to combine. Return to the heat and simmer until the compote reaches a thick, jam-like consistency, about 8 minutes. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thick on a floured work surface and then cut into 4-by-3-inch rectangles using a pastry press or knife. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.

If you&#39;re buying from a small producer, like the lovely turkey I used from my mate Paul Kelly, you&#39;ll often find these birds come with their own cooking instructions. Really good-quality birds do cook in a shorter time so follow the instructions if it has them.<br> This year I&#39;m using a flavoured butter to give a bit of extra love to my turkey, and this is a job you can do the day before. Get your turkey and use a spoon to work your way between the skin and the meat. Start at the side of the cavity just above the leg and work gently up towards the breastbone and towards the back so you create a large cavity. Pick up half of your butter and push it into the cavity you&#39;ve created. Use your hands to push it through the skin right to the back so it coats the breast meat as evenly as possible. Do the same on the other side then rub any leftover butter all over the outside of the bird to use it up. If you&#39;ve got any herb stalks left over, put them in the cavity of the turkey for added flavour as it cooks. Cover the turkey in cling film/ plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator until you need it.<br> Take your turkey out of the refrigerator a few hours before you are ready to put it in the oven so it has time to come up to room temperature. That flavoured butter will already be under the skin so you&#39;ll only need a few tweaks to finish it off. Halve 2 to 4 clementines and pop them in the cavity with a few more sprigs of fresh herbs like rosemary, bay and thyme. The fruit will steam and flavour the birds in a really lovely way. Take a sprig of fresh rosemary, pull off the leaves at the bottom then spear that through the loose skin around the cavity to hold it together and keep it from shrinking back as the turkey cooks.<br> Open up the neck cavity and pack as much stuffing as possible in there, then carefully pull the skin back over the cavity, tuck it under the bird and pop it in the roasting tray. If you&#39;ve already made your gravy like I&#39;ve done, you won&#39;t need a vegetable trivet, if not, do that now by roughly chopping 2 or 3 carrots, 3 peeled onions, and 2 celery sticks. Preheat your oven to full whack and get the turkey in the roasting tray. As soon as it goes in the oven, immediately turn the heat down to 350 degrees F/ 180 degrees C/ Gas 4.<br> As a rough guide, you want to cook the turkey for about 35 to 40 minutes per 2.2 pounds or 1 kilogram, so a 15 1/2 pound/ 7 kg turkey will want about 4 to 4 1/2 hours in the oven. But there are so many variables such as the sort of oven you have and the quality of your bird. Check on your turkey every 30 minutes or so and keep it from drying out by basting it with the lovely juices from the bottom of the pan.<br> After 3 1/2 hours, remove the foil so the skin gets golden and crispy. If you are at all worried just stick a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast. When the internal temperature has reached 150 degrees F/ 65 degrees C for a good quality bird, and about 180 degrees/ 82 degrees C for a cheaper bird, it&#39;s ready to come out. Carefully put a metal skewer in the cavity and use it to lift the bird and angle it over the roasting tray so all of the juices from the cavity run out. Move the turkey to a platter then cover it with a double layer of tinfoil and 2 tea towels to keep it warm while it rests for at least 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 71786,&quot;Roasted Garlic Soup 6 large whole heads garlic 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 teaspoons salt, divided 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper, divided 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 cups chicken stock 2 cups water 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning 1 cup heavy cream, if desired 2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Asiago Crostini, recipe follows 1/3 cup olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely minced 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon hot Hungarian paprika 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed 1 sourdough baguette, sliced into 1-inch thick pieces, cut slightly on diagonal 1/2 cup shredded Asiago cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the tops off the garlic heads just to expose the bulbs and remove any excess papery skins. Place in a large sheet of aluminum foil and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Close the foil around them, leaving a space between the tops and the foil, and place on a baking sheet in the oven. Roast until soft and fragrant, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove, cool, and squeeze out the garlic into a bowl. In a large, heavy soup pot (preferably enameled cast iron) over medium-high heat, melt the butter, add the roasted garlic, and cook for 5 minutes. Add in the flour and cook until a dark golden roux is achieved, an additional 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently. Add 1 cup chicken stock, incorporate, and repeat until all the chicken stock had been added. Repeat with the water. Add the Italian seasoning, remaining salt and pepper, and stir to combine well. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Add in the cream, if using, cook for 10 minutes more at a very low simmer, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning, if needed, and serve garnished with a sprinkle of the parsley and a fresh drizzle of the extra virgin olive oil. Serve with Asiago Crostini. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the oil, garlic, and spices and mix well. Place the bread slices on a parchment-lined baking sheet. With a basting brush, coat each piece with the oil-spice mixture. Sprinkle each slice with about 1 teaspoon of the shredded cheese. Place in the oven and cook until cheese is melted and bread is starting to crisp and darken around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and let cool before serving.

Pour the water and sugar into a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. When the bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan, insert a candy thermometer in the mixture. Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until foamy and slightly holding soft peaks. The sugar is ready when it reaches 250 degrees F, what is known as the soft ball stage. Make an Italian meringue by pouring the cooked sugar down the side of the bowl while you continue to whip the egg whites. Do not pour the hot sugar onto the beaters, or it will splatter. Continue whipping the meringue on medium-high speed until the outside of the bowl is warm but not hot, about 5 minutes. Add the butter all at once and beat on medium speed until incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip until the buttercream is thick, smooth, and shiny, about 10 minutes. At his stage, you can add flavoring, if desired. The buttercream can be used immediately or can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for several weeks if held in an airtight container. If it has been chilled or frozen, allow the buttercream to come to room temperature before using, then whip it with an electric mixer on medium speed until it returns to its initial volume and is once again thick, smooth, and shiny. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 71802,&quot;Hillbilly Sushi Rolls</p>",120)]))}const g=t(r,[["render",i]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
