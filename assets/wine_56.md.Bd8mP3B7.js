Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting.

Zinfandel, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.","designation":"Hi-Rollr","title":"Yorkville Cellars 2007 Hi-Rollr Red (Mendocino County)"},{"country":"US","description":"Good blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors in this Cab, and it's nicely dry, with firm, finely ground tannins.

A bit scoury, but a good value in sparkling wine.","designation":"Brut Cuve","title":"Barefoot Bubbly NV Brut Cuve Sparkling (California)"},{"country":"US","description":"A tart, all-purpose red, with 14 different grapes in the blend. The result, predictably, is generic. No particular variety dominates; it's a high acid red wine, with stiff tannins.","designation":"Vintner's Blend #10 Red Table Wine","title":"Abacela NV Vintner's Blend #10 Red Table Wine Red (Southern Oregon)"},{"country":"US","description":"At 62,000-plus cases, you are in the land of the seamless blend. Oregon does not have vast contiguous vineyards, so these grapes must have come from here, there and everywhere. The result is a gentle, lightly fruity, crisp, clean and innocuous Pinot Noir that lacks only a sense of place.","designation":"","title":"A to Z 2008 Pinot Noir (Oregon)"},{"country":"US","description":"There's nothing subtle about the powerful elderflower, jasmine tea and ripe melon aromas that perfume this heady Riesling. It's made in a ripe, off-dry style but finishes surprisingly dry. An interesting wine, but the aromatics may be a bit dizzying.","designation":"","title":"Arbor Hill 2009 Riesling (Finger Lakes)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Fashioned in a Shiraz-like style, this C?tes du Rh?ne has pretty jam notes and a richly-textured palate of plum and chocolate winding down to a strawberry note on the short-to-medium finish. This is a weighty wine that will stand up to a hearty meal.","designation":"","title":"Chateau Mont-Redon 2008 Red (C?tes du Rh?ne)"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft and approachable, with little evidence (in the mouth) of the 15.6% alcohol listed on the label, this is a pleasant, rather generically flavored red. Don't look for California-style jam; this is rather delicate, with strawberry and wild cherry fruit, light pepper, a hint of mint and light tannins.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Cathedral Ridge 2007 Reserve Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (OR))"},{"country":"es","description":"Rusty in hue, with mature, slightly old aromas of leather, gym bag, dried leaves and mature berry. The palate has depth and concentration, while the flavors are herbal and run toward baked black cherry and tobacco. Caramel and mature fruit flavors vie for control of the roasted finish.","designation":"Vi?a Centuria","title":"Bodegas Tempore 2005 Vi?a Centuria Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra del Bajo Aragn)"},{"country":"US","description":"Mouthwatering, high-toned acidity and a pleasant lemon-lime bitterness keeps the honeyed apple characteristics of this semisweet style Riesling in balance. Elegant mineral and petrol notes lead to a lingering, puckery finish.","designation":"Semi-Sweet","title":"Heron Hill 2008 Semi-Sweet Riesling (New York)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Crisp and freshly simple Riesling. There are attractive green fruits, good acidity and a bright perfumed  aftertaste. Not for aging.","designation":"","title":"Helfrich 2009 Riesling (Alsace)"},{"country":"US","description":"A perfect companion to the fall harvest season, this easy-drinking Riesling is evocative of candied apples and warm apple pie spice.

It penetrates into the mouth, a stand-off against the sweet/tart boysenberry fruit. Suspect it will be a love it/hate it type of wine, depending upon your appreciation of leather.","designation":"","title":"Melrose 2008 Baco Noir (Umpqua Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Smooth and velvety, with chocolate-cherry flavors, but the sweetness tails off quickly, disappointing the palate.

The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum. Slightly more creamy on the finish, but still it remains scratchy.","designation":"Reserva","title":"Vallobera 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)"},{"country":"US","description":"This off-dry Riesling seems herbal on the nose with a hint of fresh cut grass and bark, but in the mouth, it's all bright, ripe tropical fruits and tangerine.

This is a fine everyday Chardonnay at a fair price.","designation":"","title":"Gnarly Head 2009 Chardonnay (California)"},{"country":"Uruguay","description":"Dark, roasted and smelling of licorice, root beer, savory oak and smoke. The palate is hard and saturated, with smack-down tannins that are surely due to the 46% Tannat in the blend. Syrah and Petit Verdot are the remaining elements in this roasted, sweet, oaky wine that finishes with burnt marshmallow.","designation":"Identity","title":"Gimenez Mendez 2007 Identity Red (Canelones)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Moderately intense ruby color. Spicy red fruit aromas, leather, and sour cherry. Modest flavor intensity of creamy cherry, kirsch and spice. Fairly full-bodied but a little dilute and simple. Soft tannins make for an easy drinking week-day wine.","designation":"","title":"Domaine des Carabiniers 2009 Red (C?tes du Rh?ne)"},{"country":"es","description":"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile.

The two grapes work well together in many wines, but here they seem a bit at odds. The Cabernet carries some green, herbal, pickle barrel flavors; the Syrah brings in pepper and spice, but neither has the ripeness to flesh out the wine sufficiently. There are flavors of plum and cooked cherry, then it hits some chewy tannins and stops short.","designation":"Rock Star Red","title":"Cathedral Ridge 2007 Rock Star Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR))"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit overripe, with a raisiny taste behind the black currants, and also quite dry and tannic, with a hard, mouth-locking, dusty astringency.

Yeasty, light and tart, with green apples the strongest fruit flavor.","designation":"","title":"Cathedral Ridge 2008 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (OR))"},{"country":"US","description":"Aromatic and floral, this forward and fruity Pinot mixes spicy raspberry and strawberry fruit leading into a cherry cola core. That's where it remains through a quick fade. Good near-term drinking.","designation":"","title":"Coeur de Terre 2008 Pinot Noir (McMinnville)"},{"country":"US","description":"Cola, Dr. Pepper, cherry coke all come to mind, as this has a strong emphasis on those flavors, or sassafras as some define them.

Perfectly pleasant, though not showing much depth.","designation":"Estate","title":"Coeur de Terre 2008 Estate Pinot Noir (McMinnville)"},{"country":"es","description":"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show.

It's definitely herbal, but also brings some cured meat and tart, wild cherry flavors into play.","designation":"","title":"Amalie Robert 2007 Syrah (Willamette Valley)"},{"country":"es","description":"Here's another good value red from Borsao. It's about as potent and packed a wine as you'll find for $7, and while it's jumpy, young and aggressive, it's also full of jammy black fruit, sticky extraction and firm tannins. A classic mouthfiller with spunk, color and heft.","designation":"Monte Oton","title":"Borsao 2009 Monte Oton Garnacha (Campo de Borja)"},{"country":"US","description":"Despite some richly extracted blackberry and black currant flavors, this wine's tannins and acids are out of whack.

Quite front-loaded on the palate with intense juicy blackberry-cherry fruit.  Full-bodied, crisp, slight granular texture and crunchy tannins. Alcohol generous but not intrusive allowing fruit to come through on the finish.","designation":"Les Vieilles Vignes","title":"Alain Voge 2007 Les Vieilles Vignes  (Cornas)"},{"country":"es","description":"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose.

A blend of 10% Merlot, 56% Syrah, and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark, plum-colored and dusty with scents of plum and prune.

Give it 4C5 years in a cool cellar.","designation":"Jenkins Vineyard","title":"Lynmar 2007 Jenkins Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This single-vineyard blend's flavors run through all the berries right into dense cassis. It gathers more strength as it rolls through the midpalate, layering in earth and black cherries, with char and toast more noticeable than in the other Tamarack reds.","designation":"DuBrul Vineyard Reserve","title":"Tamarack Cellars 2007 DuBrul Vineyard Reserve Red (Rattlesnake Hills)"},{"country":"US","description":"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.","designation":"Estate Grown","title":"Pfendler 2008 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful Pinot Noir, although it's a bit brusque in acidity. Still, it's enormously rich and dry, with long-lasting flavors of raspberry tart and cherry-cinnamon granola. Give it a brief decant, and drink with rich, umami-inspired fare, like teriaki salmon or cured meats.","designation":"Morelli Lane Vineyard","title":"Lost Canyon 2008 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Tasted beside the wonderful 2006, this Bordeaux blend is considerably more tannic and aloof. Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's very deeply flavored in black and red currants, licorice and dusty Asian spices, while lots of new French oak adds a sturdy framework. Seems an obvious candidate for the cellar, and should blossom after 2011.","designation":"Grand Vin","title":"Alienor 2007 Grand Vin Red (Lake County)"},{"country":"US","description":"Very ripe, rich and new-oaky, with dazzling flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, limes, caramel and buttered toast, drizzled with vanilla honey.

Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges.","designation":"","title":"Au Bon Climat 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a very rich, ripe, flamboyant Pinot, made in the lush California style. It's flashy in complex tiers of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and cinnamon spice, yet is silky and dry. The fruit comes from Sonoma Coast, Green Valley and the Middle Reach. An impressive followup to the inaugural '07, and a bottling to watch.","designation":"Les Pommiers","title":"EnRoute 2008 Les Pommiers Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"nz","description":"Plummy and dark, with accents of cedar, dark chocolate and hints of coffee.

This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mlange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantialcherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf.","designation":"Red Wine","title":"Quilceda Creek 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Lots to admire in this Cab. It's bone dry and rich in blackberry and cedar flavors, with overtones of mocha, anise and toast, and is very tannic. Clearly made in a leaner style than today's high-alcohol cult style, it trades some richness for elegance and finesse. This is a wine that puts its bet on cellaring. Try after 2013.","designation":"","title":"Clos du Val 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)"},{"country":"US","description":"The palate can tell a superbly structured Cabernet from a flawed one, and this Cab shows off its pedigreed origins with flash. Great tannins, fine acidity, fully dry, and with a rich veneer of oak, it has perfectly ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and dark chocolate.","designation":"Dead Fred Vineyard","title":"Selene 2007 Dead Fred Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.","designation":"Journey","title":"Matanzas Creek 2007 Journey Chardonnay (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"US","description":"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.","designation":"Redwood Ranch","title":"Joseph Jewell 2008 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows the volume of this warmish, high mountain vineyard, with enormously ripe flavors of cherries, red currants and red plums, with elaborate sweet oak.

Fine now, and should slowly develop over the next six years.","designation":"Pisoni Vineyard","title":"Testarossa 2008 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)"},{"country":"US","description":"This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed.","designation":"Klipson Vineyard","title":"Seven Hills 2007 Klipson Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)"},{"country":"US","description":"Opulence, lushness and a silky, seductive texture are what you expect from Pinot Noir, and this one delivers them all. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with subtle, complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, red currants, licorice, bacon and peppery spices. Easy to drink from the get-go, and gets more interesting as it warms in the glass.","designation":"","title":"Of The Place 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Very ripe and extracted, almost jammy, with primary fruit flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red plums, currants, dark chocolate and spices.

Feels hard and sandpapery and raspingly dry. Deep down inside is a molten core of ripe blackberries and black currants, with lots of new, smoky oak. Seems to be your classically ageable Napa red. Give it until at least 2013, and it could surprise and delight for many years beyond.","designation":"","title":"William Hill Estate 2007 Meritage (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6C8 years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.","designation":"Vyborny Vineyard Plus","title":"Goldschmidt 2006 Vyborny Vineyard Plus Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"au","description":"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.","designation":"The Noble Wrinkled","title":"D'Arenberg 2008 The Noble Wrinkled Riesling (McLaren Vale)"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. A scour of minerals gives the wine a steely grounding, while brilliant acidity makes the finish ultraclean. Really beautiful, a top Russian River Chardonnay at a fair price for the quality. The vineyard is in the cool Green Valley.","designation":"Ruxtan Vineyard","title":"Lost Canyon 2008 Ruxtan Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dark, dense, spicy and full of everything nice, including cola, berry, earth and richness. The palate has ideal ripeness and power, and the flavors are a clever mix of light herbs, spice, chocolate and blasting berry. Long and sultry on the finish, with tobacco and immense complexity. One of cl's very best wines; a blend of Syrah, Carmenre, Cabernet and Merlot.","designation":"G","title":"Emiliana 2006 G Red (Colchagua Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A superb bubbly, almost entirely comprised of Chardonnay, with 2% Pinot Blanc. It's super-sophisticated, with that elegantly dry, crisp, yeasty feeling associated only with the best sparkling wines. Shows its California origins in the ripe lemon, lime and strawberry flavors that flatter, then pull back into a closure of minerals and spice. A great wine, although the mousse could be finer.","designation":"Le Rve Blanc de Blancs","title":"Domaine Carneros 2004 Le Rve Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Carneros)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Prunes and dark chocolate, rather than fresh fruits, dominate this dark-hued wine. It has big spice along with dense tannins, power and immense concentration. The acidity brings a light moment of freshness. For aging, 4C5 years.","designation":"Clos Triguedina The New Black Wine","title":"Jean-Luc Balds 2007 Clos Triguedina The New Black Wine Malbec (Cahors)"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful, ultrafine Cabernet that shows rich blackberry, black currant, violet, cocoa and cedar flavors, and while it has tightly wound mountain tannins, it's entirely approachable now. A great, delicious success that's capable of aging for a good ten years, in a proper cellar. From the Davies family, of Schramsberg.","designation":"","title":"JD 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)"},{"country":"US","description":"A gorgeous wine, dry and complex, whose natural fruit richness and acidity have been accented by full-bore Burgundian treatment of sur lies and oak barrel aging. It's basically a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrus flavors and a mouthwatering green fruit taste that suggests limes and kiwis. Combines a bracing quality with richness, and the result is compelling.","designation":"","title":"Chalk Hill 2008 Sauvignon Gris (Chalk Hill)"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful wine that will redefine the way you view Lake County. Mostly Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's extraordinarily rich and refined in the mouth, a lovely wine to drink now. Shows new oak-inspired raspberry, cherry, red currant and Indian spice flavors that linger into a long finish.","designation":"Grand Vin","title":"Alienor 2006 Grand Vin Red (Lake County)"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine's dense complexity is immediately apparent in the nose; offering hints of Asian spice, cinnamon, cardamom, along with supple layers of purple and black fruits. The tannins are substantial and fine-grained, perfectly ripe, and the threads of black olive, smoke, tar and coffee weave seamlessly into the finish. There is a balance point hereit has not reached too far; it's just right.","designation":"Foreshadow","title":"J. Bookwalter 2007 Foreshadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Very dry and tannic, as Petite Sirah should be. But unlike many Pets, it's also balanced and elegant. The official alcohol is only 13.5%, yet there's not a trace of greenness. In fact, the wine, which has plenty of French oak, is quite rich in blackberry and black currant flavors. Really a superb example, a Petite Sirah for Cabernet fans. Should evolve interestingly for many years.","designation":"Esoterica Chavez-Leeds Vineyard","title":"Kent Rasmussen 2007 Esoterica Chavez-Leeds Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rutherford)"},{"country":"US","description":"Quite a good, distinguished Cabernet. It's rich and robust, with explosive blackberry and currant flavors, liberally coated with smoky oak, that finish in a swirl of chocolate. Most exquisite are the tannins, so pure and refined. The name refers to the number of barrels in the blend, which comes from St. Helena, Rutherford and Spring Mountain.","designation":"2009-3-5","title":"Hunnicutt 2006 9-3-5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Too young for drinking now, or anytime soon for that matter. It's all primary blackberry and currant fruit, new oak and tannins. But there's a dramatic quality to the structure, a purity of parts that suggests the cellar. There are waves of licorice, mocha and buttered cinnamon toast, with everything vying for supremacy. Let all the elements battle it out for a good six years. This wine should age gracefully through 2015, at least.","designation":"Estate Moose Valley Vineyard","title":"D.R. Stephens 2006 Estate Moose Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation.","designation":"","title":"Hunnicutt 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Mostly Cabernet, with a small percentage of the other Bordeaux varieties, this is a very rich, dramatically layered wine. It's notable for both its intensely smooth tannins and the lush fruit, which suggests waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, rose petals and oak, courtesy of 100% new French barrels. Yet there's an underlying minerality that gives firmness and grounding. Feels ultrarich on the palate now, and should ride out the next decade with ease.","designation":"","title":"Notre Vin 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)"},{"country":"US","description":"A terrific Cabernet marked by the superbly ripe, fine tannins and classic blackberry and black currant fruit Napa so routinely delivers. Fully dry, it feels rich and full-bodied and important in the mouth, a wine to drink with fine foods and linger over as it breathes in the glass. Good now, after a brief decant.","designation":"Oakville Terraces","title":"De Sante 2006 Oakville Terraces Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar. Combines great Highlands fruit power and tannic structure with a silky, delicate mouthfeel. Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013.","designation":"Doctor's Vineyard","title":"Testarossa 2008 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is one of the greatest Carneros sparkling wines in memory. It feels softly crisp and creamy in the mouth, with brilliant, complex flavors of limes, raspberries and vanilla, and yeasty, oak influenced notes of brioche. There's a richness throughout that's hard to put into words, but the palate understands.","designation":"Brut","title":"Schramsberg 2005 Brut Sparkling (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This vintage has the Horiuchi artist label. Another glorious wine from the 2007 vintage, full and forward, packed with plum and purple fruits. Sweet tobacco and baking spices lead into a lush, fruit-loaded core, ripe with berries and plums.

It has the lushness and complexity you want in a fine California bottling, with a silky texture and crisp acidity.

Lots of new oak, but it's perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.","designation":"Tina Marie Vineyard","title":"Fulcrum 2008 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.","designation":"Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4","title":"Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.","designation":"Gap's Crown Vineyard","title":"Fulcrum 2008 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry.

The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity.

Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow.","designation":"Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard","title":"Au Bon Climat 2007 Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes.

NowC2014.","designation":"Diana's","title":"Testarossa 2008 Diana's Chardonnay (Central Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It displays the qualities of dryness and yeastiness, with complex flavors of limes, vanilla and a touch of raspberry. The mousse is very fine, while the acidity is extraordinarily clean and brisk. Beautiful now, and should age for many years.","designation":"Brut","title":"Schramsberg 2005 Brut Sparkling (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a revelation. The complex and site-specific aromas suggest wild herb, lavender, lemon verbena and black olive. The tannins are supple and ripe, with no green edge at all.

Bookwalter 2007 Conner Lee Vineyard Conflict Red (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Expensive, but brilliant. At the forefront of California Sauvignon Blanc.

Delicious and compelling, this wine lifts Sauvignon Blanc into entirely new territory.","designation":"Musque","title":"Chalk Hill 2008 Musque Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill)"},{"country":"US","description":"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.","designation":"Vyborny Vineyard","title":"Goldschmidt 2007 Vyborny Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful, classy Cab, marked by smoky new oak and very ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with a streak of minerals. The vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, in the valley's far east. You can taste the sunshine in the wonderful fruitiness, and the tannins are extraordinarily refined, but they're also aggressive. Fine now, with a long decant, but should develop bottle complexity over many years.","designation":"Cloudy's Vineyard","title":"Janzen 2007 Cloudy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Hard mountain tannins characterize this Cab, which was grown above 2,000 feet in the Mayacamas. It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring. Best 2012C2018.","designation":"Christopher's","title":"Stonestreet 2006 Christopher's Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.","designation":"","title":"Legacy 2006 Red (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This feels slightly softer in the mouth than the massive 2006, but carries the density and gravitas that one associates with Quilceda Creek.

It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6C8 years.","designation":"Five Sisters","title":"Lynmar 2007 Five Sisters Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Too sweet in sugary blackberry jam to earn a higher score, but if that's your liking, go for it.","designation":"Estate Grown","title":"Rosa d'Oro 2008 Estate Grown Barbera (Clear Lake)"},{"country":"Uruguay","description":"Not very lively or fruity.

The fruit is just fine, ranging from lemons and limes to riper kiwis and green melons, and the finish is totally dry. But what really impresses is the natural acidity.

Entirely unoaked, this is a great restaurant wine.","designation":"","title":"Mercy 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco)"},{"country":"fr","description":"88-90 Barrel sample.

Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Finca Sophenia 2008 Reserve Merlot (Tupungato)"},{"country":"US","description":"Very ripe, to the point of overripe.

For $8 this should not disappoint.","designation":"","title":"Capa 2008 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)"},{"country":"es","description":"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries.

Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.","designation":"Glorioso Crianza","title":"Bodegas Palacio 2006 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja)"},{"country":"US","description":"Tannins mark this tough, still young wine from beginning to end. The astringency envelops the fruit, giving the mouthfeel a hard, dry astringency. Even though there are some well-developed blackberry and currant flavors, the wine is unrelieved in harshness.

The aromas include more earthy barnyard scents, the color has a hint of maturity, and no new oak was used.

Trisaetum's James Frey is out to change that, and is off to a great start. This 2008, like its predecessor, captures the complexity, grace and compelling charm of the grape.

A feminine wine, it has great charm now, and should develop in the bottle for many years.","designation":"Rennie Reserve","title":"Flora Springs 2007 Rennie Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)"},{"country":"US","description":"An amazingly rich, complex and ageworthy wine. Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth.

Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosch bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory. Should age effortlessly for at least a dozen years.","designation":"Bosch","title":"Freemark Abbey 2005 Bosch Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)"},{"country":"US","description":"A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary. They flood the mouth with the essence of Cabernet, with ripe blackberries, black currants, raspberries and mocha, and the spicy finish lasts for a full minute. Give it until 2013, and it should provide great drinking through 2019, at least.","designation":"Red Wine","title":"Quintessa 2007 Red Wine Red (Rutherford)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a very high-class Cabernet.

With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries.

Just lovely, now and through 2014.","designation":"Pearlessence","title":"Failla 2008 Pearlessence Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"fr","description":"A gold-colored wine.
