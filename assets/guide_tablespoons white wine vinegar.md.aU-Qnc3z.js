With the blade running, gradually add the canola oil, little by little, until the mixture is emulsified. Smash the whole garlic cloves and add to the food processor. Process until smooth and set aside. Season a pot of boiling water generously with salt. It should be as salty as the sea. Prepare an ice bath and season generously with salt. Add the haricots verts to the boiling water and cook until bright green and tender but still slightly crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the haricots verts and immediately plunge into the ice bath, then set aside. Add the frisee, gem lettuce, radicchio and haricots verts to a bowl and set aside. Pat the skin dry on the fish and score the skin. Heat a large nonstick saute pan with olive oil over medium-high heat. Place the fish skin-side down into the pan. Place another oiled pan on top of the fish to weigh it down so the skin gets crispy. Cook until the skin is crisp, about 4 minutes, then remove the oiled pan on top and flip the fish. Cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the fish to a sheet tray lined with a rack, skin-side up. To the same pan, add the shallot, calamari and rock shrimp. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half. Add 2 tablespoons of the garlic aioli and toss to combine. Add the contents of the pan to the bowl with the haricots verts and lettuces. Toss everything together to combine. The lettuces will wilt slightly. Taste for seasoning. Set up a deep-fryer with canola oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Line a plate with a paper towel. Fry the capers, thinly sliced garlic and parsley until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on the paper towel. To plate, place down the wilted salad, followed by the fish, skin-side up, and garnish with the fried capers, garlic chips, fried parsley and micro parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 6833,&quot;Grilled Burgers 1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for the grill 4 soft hamburger buns Assorted toppings Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high. Divide the beef into four 6-ounce portions. Gather each into a ball, then gently flatten into a 4 1/2-inch-wide patty about 3/4 inch thick. Press your thumb into the center of each patty to make a 1/2-inch-deep indentation (this prevents the patties from bulging as they cook). Season the patties on both sides with salt and pepper. Lightly brush the grill grates with vegetable oil, then grill the patties indentation-side up until marked on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until marked and slightly firm, about 3 more minutes for medium doneness. Remove the burgers to a plate and let rest 5 minutes so the juices redistribute. Serve the burgers on the buns; top as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 6834,&quot;Chewy Coffee Cookies 3 tablespoons coffee beans 1/3 cup turbinado sugar 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 large egg 2/3 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 to 4 teaspoons milk or water Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F.

Add water to cover completely, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook at a bare simmer, skimming the scum from the surface periodically and adding additional hot water as needed to keep the ingredients submerged, until the stock is flavorful, about 1 1/2 hours. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve, and then divide it between two containers to cool quickly. Let cool completely before freezing or refrigerating. The stock keeps for about 1 week in the refrigerator and for many months in the freezer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6842,&quot;Catalan Shredded Salt Cod Salad 1 pound boneless dried salt cod 1 small red or green pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into thin rings 1/2 large red onion, thinly sliced and separated into rings 1 large, firm, ripe tomato, thinly sliced 1/3 cup fruity Spanish olive oil 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 4 large cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Salt, if necessary, to taste 1/2 cup oil cured black olives 3 hard-boiled eggs, quartered 1/2 small bunch oregano, leaves only, finely chopped Instructions: To prepare the salt cod, rinse it well and then immerse it in a container of cold water (cut into chunks, if necessary, to fit). Refrigerate, changing the soaking water 5 or 6 times, until softened and mild (24 to 48 hours, depending on how stiff and salty it was to begin with). Drain the cod, place it in a large saucepan with the onion and the bay leaves, and cover with cold water. Bring just to a boil, reduce the heat to very low, and cover (taste the water at this stage and, if it seems excessively salty, then drain, cover again with fresh cold water, and bring to a boil). Simmer very gently until the fish is opaque and plumped, and falls apart into heavy flakes when prodded, about 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry, and remove the bones and skin, if necessary. Separate into large flakes and use right away, or refrigerate for up to 2 days before continuing with the recipe. Drain and press the cod with your fingers to extract as much water as possible. Shred the cod by hand into thin strips and transfer it to a large bowl. Add the pepper rings, onion, and tomato to the bowl and toss together gently. In another bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, pepper, and if desired, a little salt (the salt cod is usually still quite salty; taste it to determine if the vinaigrette needs any salt). Whisk the vinaigrette together until thoroughly blended. Using your hands, toss the salad with the vinaigrette until all the ingredients are coated. Transfer the salad to a platter and garnish the edges with olives and wedges of hardboiled egg. Scatter the oregano over the dish. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 6843,&quot;Veal Marsala with Egg Fettuccini 1 1/2 pounds veal cutlets for scaloppini, from the butcher counter Salt and pepper 1/2 cup flour, a couple of scoops 4 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 4 turns of the pan total 1 large or 2 small shallots, chopped 24 crimini (baby portobello) mushrooms, thinly sliced 1 cup Marsala 1/2 cup beef stock, from canned soups aisle 1 box, 12 to 14 ounces, egg fettuccini, cooked to al dente Finely chopped flat leaf parsley, for garnish Instructions: Season veal with salt and pepper. Place a large piece of plastic food wrap on a cutting board or work surface. Arrange veal between cutlets on the plastic wrap. Cover veal with additional plastic wrap and a sheet of waxed paper. Gently pound out veal with meat mallet or a small, heavy frying pan. Fold veal up in its plastic and waxed paper wrapper and set aside. Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat. Build an assembly line between the veal and the hot pan: veal, shallow dish with flour, butter and olive oil, pile of shallots and sliced mushrooms, Marsala and beef stock. Place a large platter over low heat on the burner adjacent to your veal pan. Warm it, then turn off the heat. Begin cooking the veal Marsala just before your egg fettucini goes into cooking water; the veal will take 12 minutes, the pasta 7 or 8. If you are serving the suggested side dishes or a salad, these dishes should be assembled before the veal. Dredge the veal lightly in flour. Saute cutlets in a single layer 2 minutes on each side. For each batch of veal, use 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and 1 tablespoon butter. Transfer cooked cutlets to the warm serving platter. If you have a 12 to 14-inch skillet, you should be able to make just 2 batches. Add another tablespoon extra-virgin oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet. Add half of the chopped shallots and all of the sliced mushrooms to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Saute the shallots and mushrooms for 5 minutes. Add Marsala to the pan and bring up pan drippings. Add 1/4 cup beef stock and when it bubbles, add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan to gloss your sauce. Spoon mushrooms and Marsala down over the veal. Return the pan to the stove. Add remaining extra-virgin oil, butter and remaining shallots to the skillet. Cook shallots 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup beef stock to the shallots and add the egg fettucini to the pan. Toss fettuccini with broth and butter and season with salt and chopped parsley. Transfer pasta to a serving dish and serve with warm veal Marsala. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 6844,&quot;Grilled Swordfish with Preserved Lemon Gremolata 1 small white onion, minced 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano<br> Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon 1/2 teaspoon paprika<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Two 10- to 12-ounce swordfish steaks<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 3 tablespoons minced Preserved Lemon, store-bought or recipe below 3 tablespoons minced pitted kalamata olives<br> 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves<br> Handful fresh basil leaves<br> 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced<br> 4 Meyer lemons, halved 1/3 cup salt<br> 1 bay leaf<br> Water or freshly squeezed lemon juice, to cover<br> Instructions: For the swordfish: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.

These are both typical peppers imported from Spain. Preheat the grill to high heat. In a cast iron or grill-safe skillet, toast the nuts until lightly colored and toasted, 3 to 5 minutes, being careful not to burn them or they get very bitter. Remove the nuts and reserve. On the grill, lightly char the tomatoes on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes each side, rotating until all the sides are lightly charred. At the same time on the grill, roast the garlic cut-side down until the cut side gets nicely colored and the garlic begins to soften. Alternatively, if using a conventional oven, place the raw hazelnuts, tomatoes (do not core the tomatoes or their liquid will spill out while roasting) and garlic cut-side down on a baking sheet and roast in a preheated 400 F oven for about 10 minutes. Remove the toasted hazelnuts and reserve. Return the tomatoes and garlic back to the oven for 20 to 30 minutes more. The tomatoes should be deeply roasted and the garlic should be nicely colored on the cut side and begin to soften. When they are ready, remove the tomatoes and the garlic from the grill or oven. When cool enough to handle, peel the tomatoes and set aside. In the bowl of a food processor, add the hazelnuts and the grilled or toasted bread. Lightly pulse 2 to 3 times until the bread and nuts start to break down, but are not all ground. Add the tomatoes, reconstituted Romesco or Nora peppers and roasted garlic (squeeze the cloves out of their skin) and lightly process while gradually streaming in the oil, a little at a time, as if making a mayonnaise. Romesco should have both a fine chunky integrity to the sauce and a smooth silky texture. Finally, add the vinegar and season with salt and black pepper or crushed red pepper, if using. Add a little water if the sauce is too thick. The final sauce should be thick and concentrated but still loose. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 6863,&quot;Lemon Buttercups 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup sour cream 1 egg yolk 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 egg 1/2 cup sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest Confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or using your fingers, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and, using your fingertips, pinch the ingredients together into a sandy, crumbly mixture. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the sour cream and egg yolk until very smooth. Add the flour mixture and mix until the dough comes together. The dough may feel a little dry. Form into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, egg, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest.

Lightly whisk and let sit until bubbly and the yeast is bloomed, about 5 minutes. Add the oil. Mix the all-purpose flour and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Set the mixer to medium-low speed and slowly add the yeast mixture until entirely incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl to get everything homogenous. Knead on medium low until the dough is glossy and forms a rough ball, about 5 minutes. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set it in a warm part of the kitchen until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Split the dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the balls of dough as THIN as possible with a rolling pin. To get an even \\u201ctrimmed\\u201d circle, use a large round lid to trim a rim around the dough. Sprinkle some semolina flour on a pizza peel. Carefully transfer the round of dough to the peel. Dock the crust with a fork or docker, poking holes all over the surface to keep it thin and crispy. Working quickly, add half of the pizza sauce almost all of the way to the edge of the crust, leaving about a 1-inch border. For the pepperoni side, place an even layer of pepperoni directly on top of the sauce on half of the pizza. Combine the skim- and whole-milk mozzarella in a large bowl and top the entire pizza with half of the cheese. Top the pepperoni side with some more scattered rounds of pepperoni. For the sausage side, spread half of the giardiniera on top of the cheese, then dollop with hunks of the Italian sausage on top. Transfer to the pizza stone in the oven and bake until golden and bubbly, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board with the pizza peel. Make another pizza with the remaining ingredients. Let the pizza rest for 4 or 5 minutes, then cut into small squares--never triangles. This is called the party cut. Why?

To make Lemon Tarragon Dressing: Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, then gently combine with tuna mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6872,&quot;Coconut Pineapple Creme Caramel 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/2 cup water 1 cup crushed pineapple 1/2 quart half and half 6 ounces fresh coconut meat (or 4 ounces coconut flakes) 2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 2 vanilla beans, split and scraped 8 whole eggs 4 egg yolks Sugar to taste (between 1/2 to 3/4 cup) 2 cans (13 ounces) coconut milk Instructions: Start by making the caramel. In saucepan cook the sugar and water on top of stove until it starts caramelizing, changing color. When it becomes dark golden, add the crushed pineapple carefully because it will splatter. (Sometimes it is better to heat the crushed pineapple prior to incorporating it into the sugar.) When completely incorporated pour into a 9-inch cake pan and set aside to cool. It will appear to be very soft candy. Make custard mix by heating half and half with the coconut and the vanilla, if using the bean. Right before it starts to boil, pull off the heat and combine with the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract and coconut milk. Pour into cake pan that has been coated with the caramel and cook in a water bath in a 325 degree oven until it sets or feels firm (approximately 1 1/2 hours). Cool in refrigerator for 24 hours. To serve, place the serving platter on top of the cake pan and turn the custard over, lifting the pan off. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 6873,&quot;Green Eggs and Ham Pizza 1 22-ounce bag refrigerated pizza dough, at room temperature 1 8-ounce ball fresh mozzarella 1 7-ounce ham steak 5 tablespoons pesto 4 large eggs Grated Parmesan cheese, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450?

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the middle of the pastry. Combine the egg yolk with the ice water in a small bowl, whisking to blend; pour it into the well and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the ring, especially the scalloped edges. Shave off the excess hanging dough with a knife. Put the tart in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to relax. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the tart pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven. Line the tart with aluminum foil and add pie weights or dried beans to keep the sides of the tart from buckling. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and weights. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the crust with a beaten egg white. Return to the oven and continue to bake for another 8 minutes until the tart is golden in color, but not brown. Remember the tart will be cooked again with the filling. It should be cooked but light in color so that it will not burn on the second bake. Set aside to cool and lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. To make the filling: Heat the heavy cream and milk in a pot over medium-low flame, until it simmers slightly around the edges. Remove from the heat; add the chopped chocolate and stir until melted and smoothed out. Add the sugar and salt and whisk until well incorporated. Beat the eggs in a small bowl until blended and add them to the chocolate mixture, stir until completely blended. Pour the filling into the cooled tart shell and bake at 325 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away - that means it is beginning to become over baked. Cool before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 6890,&quot;Fried Chicken Wings with Emeril&#39;s Essence 5 pounds chicken wings 3 cups buttermilk 1 (5-ounce) bottle red pepper sauce (recommended: Emeril&#39;s Kick It Up Red Pepper Sauce) 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon Essence, recipe follows 5 teaspoons salt 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Cut the chicken wings at the joints, and set the wing tips aside for another purpose. In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, hot sauce, 1/4 cup Essence and 3 teaspoons salt. Whisk to combine, add the chicken, and toss to coat thoroughly. Cover the bowl, transfer to the refrigerator, and marinate for at least 1 hour, and up to 4 hours before proceeding. Preheat a large cast iron Dutch oven with 1 quart of peanut oil to 360 degrees F. Place the flour in a large resealable plastic food storage bag and season with 1/4 cup of the Essence and remaining salt. Add 8 pieces of chicken at a time to the seasoned flour and shake to evenly coat. Remove from the bag and place on a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Continue to coat the wings and allow them to sit for 10 to 15 minutes before proceeding. Fry the chicken in batches, about 10 to 12 pieces at a time. When you add the chicken to the hot oil, the temperature will drop drastically. Raise the heat to high once the chicken is in the pot. The temperature should level off at around 300 degrees F. Fry the chicken until golden brown and the meat is cooked all the way through, about 7 to 8 minutes. Be sure to return the oil to 360 to 370 degrees F before frying another batch of chicken. Continue this process until all of the chicken is fried. Season the fried chicken with the remaining tablespoon of Essence. Serve hot. (The chicken can be kept in a preheated 200 degree F oven once fried to keep warm while you fry the remainder of the chicken.) Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

Brush the sides and bottom of a 2-quart baking dish with oil. Combine the tofu, 2 tablespoons oil, almonds, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a food processor and pulse until completely smooth. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and deeply golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the parsley and thyme. Transfer the onion-herb mixture to a small bowl. (There&#39;s no need to wipe out the skillet; there&#39;s a lot of flavor in there.) Combine the potatoes, almond milk, 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon salt in the skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, gently tossing the potatoes from the bottom to the top with a rubber spatula frequently, until the liquid has reduced and thickened and the potatoes are just slightly tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer half of the potatoes and cooking liquid to the oiled baking dish and arrange in an even layer. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and few grinds of pepper. Drizzle with half of the tofu mixture and sprinkle with about a third of the onion-herb mixture.

When the oil is hot add the onion with a pinch of salt and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Raise the heat and add the white wine. Cook until the wine has reduced by half. Stir in the beans and oregano and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook gently for 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve. In a medium bowl, make the dressing by mixing 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice with the lime juice, honey, oil and jalapeno. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the pineapple and onion. Gently fold in the avocado and cilantro. Let the flavors blend for at least 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 6896,&quot;Peppermint Hot Chocolate 2 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon peppermint extract<br> 4 ounces good-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped<br> 3 ounces peppermint schnapps, optional<br> 2 full-size marshmallows, for garnish Instructions: Combine the milk and the peppermint extract in a medium saucepan.

Line two 2 dozen mini-cupcake pans with paper liners and spray with oil spray. Sift the flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a bowl and set aside. In the bowl of an upright mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and shortening on medium speed, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar and vanilla and beat on medium until fluffy, 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and add the whole egg and egg whites, and beat until incorporated. Turn the mixer to low. Add the flour mixture, alternating with the water, in three additions, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Scrape down the bowl, then mix on low. Using a small ice cream scoop, fill the prepared pans three-quarters of the way full with batter and bake until baked through, about 9 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. Set aside for assembly. For the buttercream: To melt the chocolate, place it in a double boiler over simmering water on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally until completely smooth and no pieces of chocolate remain. Remove from the heat and let cool until lukewarm, 5 to 15 minutes.<br> In a medium heavy-bottomed pot, whisk the sugar and flour together. Add the half-and-half and milk and cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until the mixture comes to a boil and has thickened, about 20 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on high speed until cool. Reduce the speed to low and add the butter; mix until thoroughly incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and white chocolate and continue mixing until combined. If the frosting is too soft, put the bowl in the refrigerator to chill slightly, and then beat until it is the proper consistency. If the frosting is too firm, set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and beat with a wooden spoon until it is the proper consistency. For the meringue: Place the sugar, cream soda, corn syrup, salt and egg whites in the top of a double boiler. Beat with a handheld electric mixer for 1 minute. Place the pan over boiling water, being sure that the boiling water does not touch the bottom of the top pan. (If this happens, it could cause your frosting to become grainy.) Beat constantly on high speed with electric mixer for 7 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. For the popcorn: Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan on medium-high heat. Put 3 popcorn kernels into the oil and cover the pan. When the kernels pop, add the rest of the popcorn kernels in an even layer. Cover, remove from the heat and count 30 seconds. Return the pan to the heat. The popcorn should begin popping soon, and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner. Try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let the steam from the popcorn release (the popcorn will be drier and crisper). Once the popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the pan from the heat, remove the lid and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl. If you are adding butter, you can easily melt the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. Then, toss the popcorn in the butter and add salt to taste. For the idol envelopes: With the edible ink marker, print on the white fondant paper the words \\the winner is\\ in 1-inch squares. With scissors, cut out the squares and reserve to the side for assembly. Measure the red fondant with a ruler into 1-inch squares; trace and cut. With the marker, draw a triangle from the top left corner to the center to the top right corner to give the appearance of a fold in an envelope. With a moist paper towel, wet the back of the red square without the marked fold. Then stick the white square to the red square with the writing facing out. To assemble: Fill each cupcake with the buttercream. Generously frost the top of each cupcake with Swiss meringue. Adorn with freshly popped popcorn and an idol envelope.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6898,&quot;Blackened Hanger Steak with Plantains and Chimichurri 2 tablespoons paprika 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne<br> 1/4 teaspoon chili powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Two 8-ounce hanger steaks<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley 1/4 cup fresh cilantro<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup vegetable oil 4 very ripe, black plantains, peeled and cut on the bias into 1/2-inch pieces<br> Garlic salt, for seasoning Instructions: For the blackened hanger steak: Mix together the paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, cayenne, chili powder and black pepper in a bowl. Rub the mixture over the hanger steaks and put the steaks on a wire-racked baking sheet. Place in the fridge overnight. For the chimichurri sauce: In a food processor, add the parsley, cilantro, red wine vinegar and garlic. Pulse until combined but still a bit coarse, about 10 pulses. Add in the crushed red pepper, and then slowly drizzle in the oil and pulse about 5 more times. Season with salt and pepper and set aside for the flavors to meld. (The chimichurri can be made up to 3 days in advance.) For the sweet fried plantains: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the plantains in batches, taking care not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each side until dark brown. Using a spider, remove the plantains and drain on paper towels. Season with garlic salt when still hot. To cook the steaks, heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetable oil and sear all 4 sides of the hanger steaks until crusty and dark, 4 to 5 minutes each side. The steaks are done when an instant-read thermometer reads 135 degrees F. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 6899,&quot;Spice Rubbed Ribs with Chipotle-Honey Glaze 1/2 cup ancho chili powder 1/4 cup Spanish paprika 1/4 cup freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup dry mustard 1/4 cup kosher salt 1/4 cup ground coriander 2 tablespoons dried oregano 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1 1/2 tablespoons cl de arbol 1/4 cup canola oil 2 racks country ribs, 12 ribs each, membrane removed 1 1/2 cups clover honey 3 heaping tablespoons chipotle in adobo puree Parsley sprigs, for garnish Clover honey, to taste Chipotle in adobo, pureed, to taste Salt and pepper Instructions: Combine all spices in a small bowl.<br> Brush both sides of the racks with oil and liberally rub with the spice mixture.

Whisk 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and 1 tablespoon crab boil seasoning in a nonreactive baking dish just large enough to hold the walleye. Add the walleye and turn to coat, then let sit while the oil heats, about 10 minutes. Stir together the flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, baking powder, salt and remaining 2 teaspoons crab boil seasoning in a shallow bowl or container. Drizzle in the remaining 3 tablespoons buttermilk, a tablespoon at a time, and toss to make small clumps. When the oil reaches 365 degrees F, remove the fillets from the buttermilk and dredge in the flour. Return the dredged filets to the buttermilk mixture, then do a final dredge in the flour mixture. Add two fillets to the oil, one at a time, and fry in batches of two, turning once or twice, until very crisp and deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to the rack and season with salt. To assemble, spread the bottoms of the Buns with some of the Tartar Sauce. Top each with a piece of fried walleye, squeeze of lemon, a dollop more of Tartar Sauce, lettuce and pickles. Serve immediately. Put the potato in a medium saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until tender, about 18 minutes. Drain, reserving 3/4 cup potato cooking water. Let the water cool until lukewarm (90 to 100 degrees F). Use a ricer or food mill to puree the warm potato into the bowl of a stand mixer. (You can also mash with a masher; just make sure to get the potatoes very smooth.) Add the butter, honey and salt to the warm potatoes and stir until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Add 1 egg, the yeast and the lukewarm cooking water. Mix with the dough hook on low speed to combine. Add 3 1/2 cups of the flour and mix on low to combine. Knead on medium-high speed, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour, if needed, to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough that forms a loose ball on the dough hook, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the dough onto a floured countertop and knead a few times to make a smooth ball. Oil a large bowl, add the ball and turn to coat. Cover loosely and let rise until doubled in size, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Punch the dough down. Dust a clean, flat work surface with flour. Turn out the dough and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, pinch the dough under itself to form a ball. With the pinched side down, cup your hands under the dough and rotate on the counter to form a smooth ball. Use one hand to roll the ball into a 4-inch-long oval roll. Place on a lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining balls of dough. Cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rise until light and airy looking, 30 to 40 minutes. Place an oven rack in the lower and upper third positions. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. When the dough has completed the second rise, beat the remaining egg with a tablespoon of water in a small bowl and gently brush the rolls with the egg wash. Sprinkle with the poppy seeds. Bake, rotating from top to bottom and back to front halfway through, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Rolls can be made a day ahead. For longer storage, wrap and freeze. Combine the mayonnaise, pickles, brine, parsley, tarragon and garlic powder in a small bowl. Season to taste, if needed.

Add the bacon and set the pan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels. Do not discard the bacon fat: Reserve that deliciousness! Add the butter and onion to the pan with the bacon fat; season with salt and cook until the onion is soft and aromatic, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture looks like wet sand, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk, mustard and a few shakes of Tabasco. Season with salt and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the mixture is slightly thicker than heavy cream, 6 to 8 more minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook 1 minute less than the instructions on the package suggest. Taste it: It should be toothsome, with just a little nugget of hard pasta still in the center-this is al dente. Drain the pasta. Add the Cheddar, fontina and Parmesan to the milk mixture and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed, adding a little more milk if the mixture seems too thick. Stir in the cooked bacon and pasta. The mixture should be very creamy and flavorful. Serve immediately.

Roast the potatoes until fork tender, about 1 hour, then let cool. When the potatoes are just warm to the touch, scoop out the insides into a food mill and mill into a large bowl. Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt, pepper and egg yolks and gently incorporate. Add the flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough just comes together. Turn out the dough on a floured surface and knead the dough, working quickly, until the dough loses its stickiness and becomes more solid. Shape small portions of the dough into long ropes 1/2-inch wide and cut with a knife into 1/2-inch-long squares. Repeat with the remaining dough. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the gnocchi in batches, stirring gently once or twice to ensure that they are not sticking. Boil until they float to the surface, then drain and set to the side. For the garlic cream: In a stockpot over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the garlic and simmer until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the cream, salt and pepper and simmer on low heat, occasionally stirring, for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, start the gremolata: Rough-chop the Italian parsley and sun-dried tomatoes, then add to a bowl and stir in the lemon zest and garlic. Set to the side.

Line the pan with plastic wrap on all sides, leaving a 2-inch overhang; the cooking spray will help the plastic stick directly to the sides of the pan. In a food processor, pulse the chocolate wafers until very fine, like sand. Add the chocolate sauce and pulse a few more times until the mixture comes together. Pour into the prepared loaf pan and firmly press into the bottom of the pan to create a crust. Freeze for 30 minutes to set. Meanwhile, remove the chocolate-chocolate chip gelato from the freezer to soften. After 30 minutes, remove the loaf pan from the freezer and spread the chocolate gelato over the crust; use a small offset or rubber spatula to spread the gelato into a flat, even layer. Return the loaf pan to the freezer for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, let the vanilla bean gelato soften at room temperature. When the vanilla gelato has softened, transfer it to a bowl and stir in the sliced Amarena cherries, the Amarena syrup and the red food coloring if using. Mix until the cherries are evenly dispersed and the food coloring is completely incorporated. Remove the loaf pan from the freezer and evenly spread the cherry gelato over the chocolate gelato. Place back in the freezer for at least 1 hour more; it takes longer for the cherry layer to set. Thirty minutes before the cherry layer is set, remove the pistachio gelato from the freezer to soften. When softened, spread in an even layer over the cherry gelato; the pistachio layer should come up nearly to the top of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze overnight. When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap from the top of the pan and invert the spumoni onto a cutting board. Gently lift the loaf pan away and remove the remaining plastic wrap. Slice the spumoni into 3/4-inch slices, using a chef&#39;s knife dipped in warm water; dip the knife in the warm water between each slice.

Spoon the filling into the crust; dot with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Drop large spoonfuls of the topping over the filling and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar. Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and bake until the topping is golden, 50 minutes to 1 hour. (Cover the pie with foil if it is browning too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let cool until set, about 3 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6951,&quot;Shallot Vinaigrette 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons agave nectar<br> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 small shallot, minced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Favorite greens, for serving Instructions: Combine the olive oil, vinegar, agave, mustard and shallots in a bowl and whisk until combined.

Alternatively, pound the ingredients into a paste using a mortar and pestle. Adjust the seasonings with salt, and black pepper. For the wings: Pour the marinade over the wings, turning them so that they are well coated. Leave them to marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight, turning the wings over once or twice. Get a barbecue going and let the coals die down to hot gray ash or preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Barbecue or roast the wings, turning them a few times, until they are fully cooked through, about 15 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: The juices should run clear when a skewer is pushed into the wing&#39;s thickest point. Baste every so often with the leftover marinade throughout the cooking process. While the wings are cooking, sprinkle the brown sugar onto a plate. Quarter the oranges and dip the cut sides of each piece into the sugar. Cook on the barbecue, in a heavy dry frying pan, or under a stovetop broiler for a few minutes, or until the sugar has caramelized. Keep a close eye on the oranges to prevent them from burning. Meanwhile, char grill the chiles alongside the oranges. Serve the wings with the caramelized oranges and char-grilled chiles. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 6953,&quot;Sopito with Red Snapper Ceviche 8 ounce skinless red snapper fillet, cubed 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 1 small tomato, peeled, seeded, and diced 2 tablespoons diced red onion 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 serrano cl, seeds removed, cut into 1/8-inch dice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound masa harina 2 1/2 cups water 1 teaspoon salt Corn oil for frying 6 radishes, halved, plus julienned radish for garnish 1/4 cup micro cilantro Salt Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: To make the ceviche: Combine the snapper and lime juice in a bowl and macerate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Then slice the breast in half lengthwise and remove the skin. Next, sprinkle the breasts with the salt and pepper blend. In a bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs until evenly blended. Next, blend the breadcrumbs and parsley and keep separate for breading. Preheat some oil in a large heavy pot to 350 degrees F for frying. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. To bread the chicken, dip a breast in the seasoned flour, then the egg wash and finally evenly coat with the breadcrumbs. Repeat the process with the remaining chicken. After breading all the chicken, place in the preheated oil and allow to cook for 2 minutes. Then flip and repeat cooking for a final 2 minutes, until golden brown. After cooking, remove and allow draining of any excess oil over paper towels. After frying, spoon 1 tablespoon of the red sauce on the cooked chicken and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Then bake for 6 to 7 minutes to melt the cheese. Do not over sauce, over saucing will cause the chicken to get soggy. In a deep saucepan over medium heat, warm the remaining sauce until hot, and then toss in the cooked pasta and stir to evenly coat with the sauce. Once sauced and heated, portion to bowls and top with the baked chicken and finish with the remaining cheese.

Add tequila, lime juice, Simple Syrup and orange liqueur. Cover and shake until mixed and chilled, about 30 seconds. (In general, the drink is ready by the time the shaker mists up.) Place Lime-salt-sugar on a plate. Press the rim of a chilled rocks or wine glass into the mixture to rim the edge. Strain margarita into the glass. Put the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. (Alternatively, heat in the microwave.) Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. Blend together lime, salt and sugar in a small blender or mini food chopper. &quot;,&quot;[Tequila, Mezcal, Cava, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 6981,&quot;Duck and Dumplings with Poached Eggs 3 cups (1 pound 7 ounces) kosher salt 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) natural cane sugar 20 fresh thyme sprigs 6 duck or chicken leg quarters with skin 2 quarts duck or chicken fat 2 to 3 large Idaho baking potatoes 2 large eggs, well beaten 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed 3/4 to 1 cup (3 3/4 to 5 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough 2 teaspoons distilled vinegar 6 very fresh large eggs 2 tablespoons duck or chicken fat 1 to 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, if needed 2 cups chicken stock 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, for serving Instructions: To prepare the duck, in a baking dish just large enough to hold the duck leg quarters, combine the salt, cane sugar, and thyme. Evenly and generously coat the duck pieces with the salt mixture and arrange them in a single layer in the pan, tucking them into the salt mixture. Refrigerate uncovered overnight. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Rinse the duck and pat it dry. Arrange the duck pieces in a single layer in a large, heavy pot (such as an oval Dutch oven) or a heavy roasting pan with sides that are at least 4 inches deep. Melt the duck fat over low heat and pour it over the duck. The pieces must be submerged. Bake until the meat is spoon tender, but not falling off the bone, about 2 1/2 hours. To use the duck at once, remove it from the fat and set it and the fat aside to cool to room temperature. Pick the duck meat from the bones, trying to keep the meat in large pieces. Discard the bones and skin. Use now or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Transfer the fat to an airtight container and refrigerate until solid. Discard the layer of solidified cooking juices at the bottom of the container and refrigerate the remaining fat for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months. (For longer storage, leave the duck on the bone and submerged in the fat. Cool to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. When ready to use, reheat in a 250 degree F oven until the fat is liquid and the duck is just warm.) To prepare the dumplings, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pierce the potatoes in several places with a fork and bake until tender, about 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough. While the potatoes are still warm, fold in the eggs and salt. Stir in 3/4 cup flour and then add the remaining flour a little at a time until the mixture resembles soft biscuit dough. The dough should be a little sticky, although when poked with a fingertip the dimple should not close up. To test the dough, bring a small saucepan of salted water to a simmer. Break off a 3/4 inch square piece of dough and drop it into the water. If the dumpling breaks apart in the water, add a little more flour to the dough. Pour the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and cut into 4 equal pieces. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust it with flour. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick rope. Cut each rope crosswise into bite-size lengths, 1 to 1 1/2 inches. Roll each piece on a gnocchi board or the back of the tines of a fork to ridge them lightly, if you wish. (The ridges help the dumplings hold the delicious broth.) Spread the dumplings onto the prepared baking sheet. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer. Salt generously. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and place them next to the stove. Add half of the dumplings to the boiling water and cook them until they float. Use a wire skimmer to transfer them to the wire rack. Cook the remaining dumplings. The dumplings can be used now as part of the finished dish, or they can be stored to use later. To store them, refrigerate the dumplings on the wire rack until chilled. Toss the cold dumplings with enough oil to keep them moist (to prevent sticking). Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To poach the eggs, fill a large skillet with water to a depth of 2 inches. Add the vinegar and bring to a simmer. Prepare a large bowl of very cold water. Break 1 egg into a small bowl or cup and slide the egg into the simmering water. Repeat with each remaining egg, spacing them evenly in the skillet; cook them in 2 batches if necessary. Poach at a bare simmer until the whites are firm but the yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to the cold water, taking care to not break the yolks. Use at once or refrigerate until ready to assemble the dish, up to 1 day. Set the skillet of water aside. To assemble the dish, in a very large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the duck fat over medium-high heat until shimmering hot. Add half the dumplings and cook until they are golden brown on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of duck fat and cook the other half of the dumplings. Return all of the dumplings to the skillet. Add the duck and the chicken stock and cook over medium-high heat until the duck is warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with the pepper and taste for salt. Meanwhile, bring the water used to poach the eggs back to a bare simmer. Divide the duck, dumplings, and broth among 6 warmed shallow bowls. Working with 1 egg at a time, slip it back into the simmering water for 30 seconds. Lift each egg from the water with a slotted spoon and pat the bottom dry with a clean kitchen towel. Place 1 egg on top of each serving. Sprinkle with thyme leaves and serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barolo]&quot; 6982,&quot;Grilled Flank Steak with Mojo and Plantains 1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus for brushing 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground allspice 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus additional for seasoning 2 teaspoons granulated garlic powder 1 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 flank steak (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1/4 teaspoon whole cumin seeds 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano leaves or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 jalapeno cl, seeded and minced 2 ripe yellow plantains<br> Instructions:</p><ol><li>For steak: Stir oil, allspice, salt, garlic powder, cayenne, and pepper together in a bowl, to make a paste.

Cut an \\x\\ shape on the tops and bottoms of the tomatoes. Boil the tomatoes until the skin begins to peel back, about 20 to 30 seconds. Plunge the tomatoes into a bowl of iced water to chill. Peel and seed the tomatoes, then chop them. In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar, and tomato juice. Mix well, and then add the diced bread to soak. In another bowl, combine the chopped tomato, cucumber, red pepper, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro and jalapeno. Reserve 1/2 cup of this chopped mixture for garnish, if desired.

Screw the cap on the jar and shake the vinaigrette vigorously to emulsify. Set the dressing aside while preparing the salad so the flavors can marry. Cooking the potatoes, eggs, and green beans in the same pot cuts down on prep time and clean up. To do this, put the potatoes in a large saucepan, add water to cover and a nice pinch of salt; bring to a boil over medium heat. Simmer the potatoes for 12 minutes to give them a head start, and then add the eggs. Place a steamer basket or colander on top of the simmering water. Put the green beans in the steamer and cover with a lid. Steam the beans for 5 minutes until crisp-tender while continuing to cook the potatoes until fork tender. Drain out the water and put the potatoes, eggs, and green beans in a colander; rinse briefly under cold water. Peel the shells off the eggs and cut them in 1/2 lengthwise. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Rub the tuna on all sides with olive oil, and a bit of the vinaigrette; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper. Lay the tuna in the hot pan and sear for approximately 2 minutes on each side; as the tuna cooks, the red meat will become whiter. Transfer the tuna to a cutting board and slice. To assemble the salad: combine the potatoes, green beans, tomatoes, olives, anchovies, capers, and chives in a large mixing bowl. Take the vinaigrette and give it another good shake to recombine. Drizzle the salad with enough vinaigrette to fully moisten and toss gently to coat; season with salt and pepper. Take care not to mush up the ingredients - the important thing about salad nicoise is that it is arranged nicely on a platter with all the elements keeping their individual integrity. Put the tossed salad down the center of a serving platter and lay the seared tuna attractively across the top and the eggs around the rim. Drizzle with the remaining vinaigrette and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 6985,&quot;\\Pearl Balls\\ - Pork Meatballs in Sticky Rice One 12-ounce piece boneless, skinless pork belly or ground pork One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled 1 shallot 1/2 cube vegetable bouillon 1 teaspoon cornstarch, plus more for rolling 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder 1 teaspoon Shaoshing rice wine Sea salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 large egg yolk, beaten 1/2 cup glutinous white rice, soaked overnight in cold water and drained Black rice vinegar, chili oil, or soy sauce, for dipping, optional Instructions: Put the pork on a large cutting board and very finely mince it with a sharp, heavy knife or cleaver until the fat is broken down (or use 2 large heavy cleavers to get the job done quicker!). Spread out the pork into a thin layer on the board. Grate the ginger, shallot and bouillon over the meat using a fine grater, and then sprinkle on the cornstarch, five-spice, Shaoshing, salt, pepper and egg yolk. Mix well until combined using a knife or spatula. Put some cornstarch in a shallow bowl. Roll the pork mixture into ping pong ball-size meatballs, and then roll in the cornstarch to lightly coat. Shake off the excess and transfer the meatballs to a plate. Using wet hands, put some of the soaked rice in your palm and roll the meatball in it with your hands, pressing gently, until evenly coated in rice. Continue rolling until the meatballs are all coated with the rice. Fill a wok one-third full with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Put a shallow flat bowl or plate with a lip into a bamboo steamer basket (make sure the plate is at least 1/2 inch smaller than the diameter of the basket) and evenly space the rice balls on the plate, being sure they do not touch each other. Cover the basket with the lid and lower it into the wok. Steam the meatballs, adding water to the wok as necessary to prevent the basket from scorching, until set and firm, 20 to 25 minutes. Carefully remove the rice balls from the steamer and transfer to a platter. Serve the meatballs with toothpicks on the side for skewering and dipping into vinegar, chili oil, or soy sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 6986,&quot;Kumquat Limoncello 2 pints kumquats 3 cups sugar 1 liter grain alcohol, such as Everclear Instructions: Wash the kumquats well under hot water.

Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect cooking with medium heat, about 350 degrees F. For a gas grill: Use a smoker box or create one using small, shallow aluminum foil pan. Remove cooking grates. Preheat grill on high. Turn one burner off. Place disposable aluminum foil pan over on burner, adding 1 handful of drained chips. Replace grates. After chips begin smoking, adjust heat to 350 degrees F. For a charcoal grill: Place large disposable aluminum foil pan on one side of charcoal grate and fill with 1 quart water. Build fire on opposite side, and let burn until coals are coated with white ash. Spread coals in grill opposite pan and let burn 15-20 minutes (you should be able to hold your hand about 1 inch above the grate for about 3 seconds). Add 1 handful of drained chips to coals. Position cooking grate in grill. Lightly oil grill grate. Grill pork with indirect heat, with the lid closed, for 45 minutes. Add remaining drained chips to box or coals and grill for 45 minutes more. Wrap pork in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Grill over indirect heat, with lid closed, about 1 1/2 hours more. (On a charcoal grill, add more charcoal as needed to maintain temperature, leaving grill lid open for a few minutes to help charcoal ignite.) Unwrap pork and continue grilling until tender and spice coating is crusty, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a carving board and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Using a knife and your fingers, pull the pork into shreds, discarding excess fat. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. While pork is resting, make vegetables: Prepare grill for direct cooking over medium-high heat, about 450 degrees F. Brush grill grates clean. Lightly oil zucchini halves and onion slices (no need to oil corn). Place onion slices, zucchini and corn on grill and close grill lid. Grill onion slices, turning once, until seared with grid marks and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes; transfer to bowl. Grill zucchini, turning once, until just tender, 6 to 8 minutes; add to bowl. Grill corn, turning occasionally, until kernels are lightly browned in spots, 10 to 12 minutes; add to bowl. Let vegetables cool. Chop zucchini and onion into bite-sized pieces, cut kernels from corn, and return vegetables to bowl. Season with salt and pepper. To make dressing: Process all ingredients in blender together until smooth and thickened. If shredded pork has cooled, you may reheat it in large nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until warm, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, radishes, zucchini mixture with corn and onions, and 2/3 cup of dressing in a large bowl. Divide salad among 6 salad bowls and top each with equal amounts of warm pork.

Line a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment or waxed paper. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream 8 ounces butter until soft. Add 1/2 cup of the sugar and mix until incorporated. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour and cornstarch. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix at low speed just until the ingredients are incorporated and the dough comes together. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead it 5 to 10 times, to bring the dough together and smooth it out. Re-flour your work surface. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to fit the sheet pan. To transfer to the sheet pan, roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, lift it up, and unroll into the pan. Using light strokes of the rolling pin, roll the dough into the corners and edges of the pan, and roll out any bumps (or press the rolled-out dough thoroughly into the pan with your fingers). Prick the shortbread all over with a fork to prevent any buckling or shrinking. Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, rotate the pan and knock it once against the oven rack, to ensure even cooking and a flat surface. Bake 10 to 15 minutes more, until very lightly browned. Let cool in the pan. Pour the remaining 2 1/2 cups sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar twice, making a cross, to moisten it. Over medium-high heat, bring to a boil without stirring. Reduce the heat to a fast simmer and cook without stirring until amber-caramel in color, 10 to 20 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons butter with a wooden spoon. Slowly and carefully pour in the lukewarm cream, stirring slowly but constantly (it will bubble up and may splatter). Pour over the baked shortbread and smooth the top. Place in the refrigerator, uncovered, to harden slightly. When the caramel has set, melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler (or in a mixing bowl) set over barely simmering water, stirring frequently. Stir in the vegetable oil (this will make the chocolate less brittle when it hardens). Pour over the cooled caramel and spread quickly with the back of a spatula or spoon to cover the entire surface. Let cool in the pan. With a heavy knife, cut into 1 1/2-by-3-inch bars. Store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7016,&quot;Lomo Ham and Fig Platter 6 to 8 ripe figs 1/2 pound Spanish Lomo Ham, sliced thin Instructions: Depending on the side of the figs, slice them in half or in quarters.

Fry for about 5 minutes until crisp and remove to a paper towel and reserve. Add the beef to the hot bacon fat and brown it evenly on all sides, turning with tongs; season generously with salt and pepper. While the beef is searing, sprinkle the flour evenly in the pot and continue to stir to dissolve any clumps. Add a little oil if necessary to keep the meat from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Toss in the onions, garlic, roasted peppers, paprika, and caraway; cook and stir for 2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in the vinegar, tomatoes, and broth. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, covered, stirring occasionally. Add the potatoes. Crumble the reserved bacon into the stew and continue to simmer for 30 minutes, partially covered, until the potatoes are tender. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and stir the sour cream into the goulash just before serving.

Halve the puff pastry and roll each into an 8 1/2-inch circle, 1/8 inch thick. Place 1 of the circles on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Pipe a 5-inch diameter mound of almond cream in the center of the circle. The mound should be about 1-inch high. Prepare the egg wash: Whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small bowl until well combined. Lightly brush the remaining 1 1/2-inch rim of the pastry circle with the egg wash. Place the second circle of puff pastry over the first. Gently press against the sides of the almond cream mound to remove any trapped air. Seal the edges of the 2 layers by pressing the top edge into the bottom edge. Use a sharp knife to give the circle a fluted edge like a flower. Use a sharp knife to pierce a 1/2-inch slit in the top layer at the center. This will allow steam to escape during baking. To make the classic pattern in the top, use a sharp knife to score a curved line that begins at the top of the mound and ends at the bottom of the mound. Repeat this line every 1/2 inch around the circumference of the mound, but be careful not to cut through the top layer and into the almond cream. Lightly brush the top with egg wash. Let the frangipane rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour before baking. (At this point, you can wrap the frangipane well in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 weeks. Let it thaw in the refrigerator or in your backpack before baking.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake until it begins to brown slightly, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: Stir together the corn syrup and water. Remove the frangipane from the oven and brush it well with the corn syrup mixture. This adds sweetness, enhances the color, and gives it a crispy crust. Continue to bake until well risen and evenly browned, about another 20 minutes. The baked frangipane should be flaky and tender, and the almond cream center still moist. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. The frangipane is best when served while it is still slightly warm. Use a serrated knife to slice it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7028,&quot;Baked Ham with Low Carb Maple Bourbon Glaze 9 to 10 pound hickory smoked ham (fully cooked), butt portion 1 teaspoon maple extract 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1 teaspoon white vinegar 1 1/4 cups sugar substitute (recommended: Splenda) 2 to 3 tablespoons bourbon 1 tablespoon whole cloves Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place ham face down in a shallow baking pan and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Place on lower rack of oven and bake for 1 hour. While the ham is baking, mix together all the glaze ingredients in a bowl and set aside. After 1 hour of cooking, remove ham from oven, uncover and stand ham up on 1 side. With a sharp knife and in a \\tic-tac-toe\\ fashion, make shallow cuts all over the fatty side of the ham, scoring 1-inch squares.

Whisk together the buttermilk, 2 of the eggs and the melted butter in a small bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and stir until just combined. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat; melt a little of the remaining tablespoon butter in the skillet. Working in batches, spoon 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet, and cook until the bottom is golden brown and small bubbles appear on the top, 2 to 3 minutes; flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes. If the pancakes brown too quickly, reduce the heat to medium-low. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate. Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more butter to the pan as necessary. (You should have at least 12 pancakes.) Whisk together the half-and-half, vanilla, the remaining 5 eggs and 3 tablespoons granulated sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Shingle half the pancakes in the prepared baking dish. Scatter half the sliced bananas and chocolate chips over the pancakes. Pour half the egg mixture evenly over the pancakes.

Generously butter a nonstick 12-cup Bundt pan. Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat 2 sticks butter, the granulated sugar and vegetable oil in a bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, at least 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Add about one-third of the flour mixture and half of the buttermilk; beat until almost incorporated. Add another one-third of the flour mixture and the remaining buttermilk. Beat, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until just combined. Add the remaining flour mixture and beat 30 seconds. Finish incorporating the flour by hand to avoid overmixing. Toss the blueberries with the remaining 2 tablespoons flour in a small bowl. Spoon one-third of the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle in half of the blueberries, then top with another one-third of the batter. Scatter the remaining blueberries on top and cover with the rest of the batter; smooth the top. Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 30 minutes in the pan. Run a small sharp knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake, then invert onto the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the toppings: Toss the strawberries with the granulated sugar in a bowl; set aside to macerate, 30 minutes. Just before serving, make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter and 4 tablespoons milk in a bowl; if the glaze is too thick, whisk in up to 1 more tablespoon milk, a little at a time. Pour the glaze over the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Serve with the strawberries and their juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 7040,&quot;Buchu Jeon 1 cup sliced garlic chives (1-inch pieces) 1/3 cup calamari or small, lean squid, such as Narragansett squid 1 medium hot pepper, like Lady Choi, Jimmy Nardello, Fresno or jalape?o, sliced thin 1/2 cup Master Jeon Batter, recipe follows 2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil, like canola 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup rice flour (or substitute cornstarch or potato starch, but do not use mochiko or sweet rice flour) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Place the garlic chives, calamari or squid and hot peppers in a mixing bowl. Add the Master Jeon Batter and 1/2 cup cold water to the mixing bowl and mix everything gently with your hands. Do not overwork the batter into the seafood and vegetables. It should look like the ingredients are barely held together with the batter. Having air pocket space, rather than one big sticky lump, is important. Place a nonstick pan over medium heat and add the oil. When the pan is hot, add the batter mixture, making sure the seafood and vegetables are laid down haphazardly with holes and spaces, rather than in one smooth pancake. Air holes are great as they will create more crispy pieces and provide space for the excess oil to drain. Cook until the edges are golden brown, about 2 minutes, then flip the pancake gently and slowly using a spatula. Cook until both sides are golden brown and the batter is no longer wet, about an additional minute. Transfer to a cookie rack or a pan lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. When cool enough to handle, slice and serve warm. Mix together the all-purpose flour, rice flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 7041,&quot;The Definitive Mashed Potato with Roasted Garlic 1 pound whole garlic heads 1/2 cup pure olive oil Gray sea salt and freshly ground pepper 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes 3 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon garlic paste 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, or more to taste Sea salt, preferably gray sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 to 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Start with the roasted garlic: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Peel the outermost layers of skin off the heads of garlic. Cut off the top 1/3 of the heads to open the cloves. Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe saute pan over medium heat. Add garlic, cut sides up, and saute for about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer pan to the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Pop garlic cloves from their skins and place cloves in a blender, along with any olive oil left in the pan. Puree until smooth; you should have a paste-like consistency. For the potatoes: Cube the potatoes. Then put the potatoes in a large saucepan with salted cold water and place in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, add some more salt and then bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well, place potato cubes in a food mill, and grind to remove skins. Alternatively, smash the potatoes with a large fork or potato masher. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the butter stops foaming and turns a light brown. Add the garlic paste and cook quickly. Add the cream, season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and fold in potatoes with a wooded spoon or large whisk. Add the remaining butter by tablespoons, stirring after each addition. Stir in the extra-virgin olive oil.

Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the olive oil and heat until shimmering. Carefully add the meatballs to the skillet and fry until crispy and brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and discard any remaining oil. Halve the potato buns horizontally without separating the buns from each other. Put the bottom buns on the prepared baking sheet and spread 1/2 cup marinara sauce on top. Line up the meatballs on top of the sauce, so that each bun will have its own meatball. Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the meatballs. Sprinkle with the basil. Lay the sliced provolone evenly over the meatballs. Place the top buns over the cheese. Mix the melted butter and the garlic salt together. Generously brush over the top buns. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan evenly over the butter mixture. Bake until the provolone melts and the topping turns golden brown, about 15 minutes. Slice into individual sliders and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 7047,&quot;Cheese-Stuffed Pork Roulade 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more, for oiling the grill grates and brushing 2 cups broccoli florets, finely chopped (about 7 ounces) 2 cloves garlic, sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups shredded Cheddar (about 8 ounces) 2 pork tenderloins, trimmed (2 to 2 1/2 pounds total) 1 medium red onion, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds 2 cups cherry tomatoes 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar Instructions: Prepare an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, leaving 1 burner off for indirect heat (to finish the roulades). Oil the grill grates. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the broccoli begins to brown in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 cup water and continue to cook until the water evaporates and the broccoli is tender, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl; stir in the Cheddar and set aside. Butterfly the tenderloins by making a 1-inch-deep incision down the length of each without cutting all the way through. Open the tenderloins like books so they lie flat, cover with plastic wrap and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet until they&#39;re about 1/4 inch thick. Remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the broccoli mixture over the 2 tenderloins, leaving a 1-inch border around all the sides except the long one closest to you. Starting with the long side closest to you, tightly roll up each tenderloin, tucking the narrow ends inside as you roll. Tie each roulade with butcher&#39;s twine tightly (without piercing the meat) at each end and at 2-inch intervals in between. Brush with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the roulades over direct heat, turning, until the outside is well marked, about 12 minutes. Move them to indirect heat, cover and cook until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of each roulade registers 145 degrees F, about 15 minutes more. Transfer them to a cutting board to rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lay a slice of onion on a cutting board. Place the palm of 1 hand on top of the slice, and with the other hand, push a metal skewer through the slice crosswise until it comes out the other side. Repeat with the other slices, leaving an inch of skewer uncovered on each end and using as many skewers as necessary. Thread the tomatoes on skewers. Brush the onions and tomatoes with oil. Grill, turning, until the tomatoes are charred and bursting and the onion slices are tender with brown edges, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the tomatoes and onions from the skewers and chop. Mix with the parsley, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl. Cut the strings off the roulades with scissors and slice the roulades on the bias.

F. Separate the eggs; put the whites in one large bowl and the yolks in another. Let stand at room temperature to warm up while you assemble all the other ingredients, about 30 minutes. (Be prepared to make the cake batter without stopping so the eggs don\\u2019t deflate.) Add the cream of tartar to the egg whites and beat with a mixer on medium speed until thickened and starting to turn white, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup granulated sugar, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until the egg whites are glossy, thick and hold stiff peaks but are not dry, about 5 more minutes. Set aside while making the rest of the batter (don\\u2019t do this ahead of time or the egg whites will deflate).<br> Add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar to the egg yolks along with the brown sugar. Beat with the mixer (no need to wash the beaters) until smooth and lightened in color, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vegetable oil and vanilla until smooth and thick, then beat in the milk (the batter will be thin). Add the flour, ground pecans, baking powder and salt and beat on low speed until thoroughly combined. Add about one-third of the beaten egg whites to the batter and fold in with a rubber spatula until combined. Add the remaining egg whites and continue to fold until no white streaks remain. Pour into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan or angel food cake pan and run the spatula around the center of the batter to create a line where excess air can escape as the cake rises. Bake the cake until the top is golden and springs back when touched and a long skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and immediately turn the cake upside down over the slim neck of a bottle (if your pan has feet, use those instead). Let cool completely. Use a thin spatula to loosen the cake around the sides and middle of the pan. Turn out onto a platter. Make the glaze: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the pecans and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the brown sugar, heavy cream, corn syrup and salt and carefully stir to combine. Continue to cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan when stirring, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool and thicken, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. When the glaze has thickened but is still pourable, spoon it over the cake, letting it drip down the sides. As the glaze cools, use the spoon or spatula to spread some of the pecans that fell down onto the top and sides. Let stand, at least 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 7050,&quot;Golden and Purple Beet-Pickled Eggs 1 pound red or golden beets, stems and leaves removed 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon turmeric, if using golden beets<br> 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns<br> 1/4 teaspoon pickling spice<br> 6 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled<br> 1 small yellow onion, peeled and sliced<br> Instructions: In a medium pot, cover the beets with cold water and boil until tender.

Add Worcestershire and Tabasco and stir to thoroughly incorporate. Press mixture down flat in skillet and cook for another 10 minutes to develop a crust. Place a plate, upside down on top of hash. Holding the plate in place with one hand, protected by a pot holder, flip the skillet over to release the hash from the skillet onto the plate. If some of it sticks to the skillet, don&#39;t be too concerned; just scrape it free. Add a bit more fat to the pan if necessary and slide the hash back into the skillet with the crust side up. Moisten with tomato juice or broth and press hash own in skillet again. Cook for another 10 minutes to develop a crust on the other side. Cut into pie shaped wedges and top with chili sauce. Serve with a green salad on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 7075,&quot;Sichuan Steak au Poivre with Scallion Mashed Potatoes 1 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, about 5 potatoes 2 large cloves garlic<br> Salt<br> 1 cup half-n-half or whole milk<br> 3 tablespoons butter<br> 1 bunch scallions, 5 to 6<br> White pepper<br> About 2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns 1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br> 4 steaks (6 to 7 ounces) beef tenderloin filet, each about 1 1/4 inches thick Kosher salt<br> 2 shallots<br> 1 inch ginger root<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> EVOO 3 tablespoons butter<br> About 1/4 cup Shaoxing Chinese sherry or 2 tablespoons cognac or brandy<br> 1 cup beef bone broth or stock<br> 1/4 to 1/3 cup creme fraiche<br> Upland cress or watercress, to serve<br> Instructions: Gather your ingredients.

Massage the bag to combine the ingredients. Add the chicken breasts, seal the bag and massage the marinade evenly into the chicken. Lay the bag flat with the chicken breasts all flat in the bag and let the air out of the bag. Using a small skillet, flat mallet or even the heel of your hand, pound the chicken to flatten slightly. It should be 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to 10 hours. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 15 minutes before cooking. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the hot skillet and swirl to coat the bottom. Add the chicken, smooth side down, and place something heavy on top of the chicken (a brick wrapped in aluminum foil or small cast-iron skillet works well here). Cook until deep golden brown on the first side, about 5 minutes. Remove the weight and flip the chicken. Continue to cook on the second side until it is firm to the touch and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part reads 160 degrees F, about 5 minutes more. Remove to a plate to rest. Add 1/3 cup of water to the skillet to deglaze.

Stir the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon apple pie spice together in a shallow dish. Set aside. Whisk together the eggs, melted shortening, lemon zest and 1/2 cup seltzer water in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture. Add the remaining seltzer water, a teaspoon at a time, just until the dough comes together in a soft and shaggy ball. Turn the dough out onto a generously-floured cutting board (it will be a bit sticky). Sprinkle the top with flour and pat out until it is about 3/8-inch thick. Cut out as many circles as possible using a 3-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, then cut out doughtnut holes from the center of each with a 1-inch round cutter. Reserve the doughnuts and holes. Gather the scraps together and pat them out again to 3/8-inch thickness. Continue to cut doughnuts and doughnut holes, reworking the scraps, until all the dough is used. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until a deep frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the doughnuts and holes until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, turning occasionally. Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain and cool slightly. While still warm, roll in the spiced sugar until well coated. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7081,&quot;Beef -The Bomb- Bourguignon 1 1/2 cups red wine 2 teaspoons salt, divided 2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper, plus more for seasoning 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 pounds rib-eye steak, cut into 3/4-inch cubes 1/2 pound bacon, diced 3 tablespoons olive oil, if needed 3/4 cup carrots, diced 3/4 cup parsnips, peeled and diced 1 cup pearl onions, frozen 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons minced garlic 3 cups beef stock 2 teaspoons freshly chopped thyme leaves 1/2 cup freshly chopped Italian parsley leaves 2 teaspoons freshly chopped oregano leaves 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 cup store-bought fried onions Instructions: In a nonmetallic bowl, combine 3/4 cup red wine, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons pepper and 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. Add the rib-eye steak and let marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cook the bacon in a large saute pan, over medium low heat to slowly render the fat. When crisp, remove to a paper towel lined plate, reserving the fat in the pan. Remove the beef from the marinade, pat dry and add to the pan with the bacon fat. Cook over medium-high heat, browning the meat on all sides. Remove the meat from the pan, to a plate. Add extra oil, if necessary, to amount to 2 to 3 tablespoons of total fat in the pan. Add the carrots, parsnips, and the frozen onions. Cook until the onions are light brown, approximately 10 minutes. Add the flour to the vegetable mixture to make a roux. When the roux begins to brown, add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Deglaze with the remaining red wine and stir in the beef broth. Reduce over medium heat for 10 minutes.

Let sit for 2 minutes to activate the yeast; it will begin to bubble. On low speed, add the flour and salt slowly, then add the olive oil. Once the dough is incorporated, about 4 minutes, remove from the bowl and knead on a lightly-floured surface for about 5 minutes. Place in a lightly-oiled bowl. Let sit in a warm place covered with a damp cloth until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the cheese sauce: Cook the onions and garlic in the olive oil in a large saute pan until translucent, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the heavy cream and simmer until the cream has reduced by half, 12 to 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the cheeses. Stir very well until all the cheese has melted. Cover with a lid or foil until ready to use. For the flatbreads: Heat grill to medium heat. Toss the mushrooms lightly in the olive oil and some salt and pepper. Grill the mushrooms until lightly charred, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Cool slightly, then remove the stems from the oyster mushrooms and slice the cremini mushrooms. For assembly: Divide the pizza dough into two equal portions and roll them out on a lightly floured surface to 10 inches long and 4 inches wide. Lightly oil the grates of the grill. Grill the flatbreads for 2 minutes per side. Remove and add 1 cup of the truffled cheese sauce to each flatbread along with the mushrooms and Parmesan. Return the flatbreads to the grill in a low-heated area. Close the lid and cook for about 4 minutes.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Make the tomato sauce: Combine the tomatoes along with their juices, butter, red pepper flakes, bay leaves, onion halves and a pinch of salt in a very large saucepan or skillet. Place over the indirect-heat side of the grill and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and using a potato masher to smash the whole tomatoes at the halfway mark. Discard the onion and bay leaves. Make the pesto: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the garlic and nuts until chopped. Add the basil with a pinch of salt and pulse until it makes coarse crumbs. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add the Parmesan and olive oil. Mix until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Place a large pot of salted water over the direct-heat side of the grill and bring to a boil. Cook the pasta 2 minutes less than the package directions, then scoop out into the tomato sauce, adding 1/2 cup pasta water. Toss to coat, then remove from the heat.

Add the shallots and saute slowly, until soft. Add the dried cherries, molasses, pepper, and duck stock. Simmer 15 minutes. Blend the arrowroot with the 1/4 cup of the Madeira. Mix the Madeira into the duck sauce and simmer 3 to 4 minutes, until slightly thickened. Set aside. (The sauce may be made ahead, up to this point.) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Season the duck cavity with the salt and pepper. Pierce the skin thoroughly around the lower breast, back, and thighs. Truss the duck and place, breast side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Place the duck in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and roast the duck 30 minutes per side. With a bulb baster, remove some of fat that accumulates as the duck roast. Turn the duck, breast side up, and sprinkle with salt. Roast 10 to 15 minutes longer for medium rare or until juices run rosy when a thigh is pierced with a fork. For well done, roast until juices run clear. Remove the trussing. Place the duck on a serving platter and keep warm in a turned off oven while finishing the sauce. (The duck may be roasted in the morning, if desired, and reheated at 300 degrees at this point.) Place under a broiler for 3 to 5 minutes for extra crisp skin. Remove all but 1 tablespoon fat from the roasting pan. Add the remaining 1/4 cup Madeira to the drippings in the pan. Boil rapidly, scraping the brown bits from the bottom and reducing the wine to 2 tablespoons. Strain the wine reduction into the prepared duck sauce. Finish the sauce with the sherry vinegar.

Remove apples, place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 2 hours, or until crisp. To prepare the apple sorbet, combine all of the ingredients together and strain. Freeze the mixture in an ice cream machine. To make the apple sauce, combine the raisins, grape juice, apple juice, sugar, and vanilla seeds, and bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cook gently until the mixture is reduced by half, about 35 minutes. Let sauce cool at least 15 minutes before serving, or store in refrigerator. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Nest the pasta on large rimmed plates, pour sauce over pasta, and garnish with scallions and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 7120,&quot;Seared Sea Scallops with Sauteed Wild Mushrooms, Fresh Herb Salad, and Roasted Garlic Beurre Blanc 4 shallots, finely diced 2 lemons, juiced 4 cups white wine, preferably Muscadet 4 fresh thyme sprigs 6 peppercorns 2 bay leaves 8 ounces roasted garlic 4 ounces heavy cream 32 ounces butter, cubed and cold Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Honey, optional 1/2 cup canola oil 24 ounces mixed mushrooms 4 tablespoons minced garlic 4 tablespoons minced shallots 4 tablespoons chopped mixed fresh herbs (parsley, tarragon, chives, basil) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 jumbo sea scallops 1 cup canola oil, divided 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Beurre Blanc: Combine the shallots, lemon juice, wine, thyme, peppercorns, bay leaves, and roasted garlic in a small sauce pot. Bring to a boil and reduce until almost dry, leaving about 1/8 cup. Reduce heat to low and add the cream. Begin adding the butter, 1 cube at a time, whisking continuously. As each cube incorporates into the sauce, add another until all butter has been added. Strain through a fine mesh strainer. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. If you feel that the sauce is too acidic, add a bit of honey to balance the flavor. Be sure to use only a small amount of honey so as not to make the sauce taste too sweet. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve. Mushrooms: Place a saute pan over high heat and add enough canola oil to just cover the bottom of the pan. Allow the pan to preheat until you just begin to see light wisps of smoke coming from the pan. Add the mushrooms and begin to saute until the mushrooms are cooked halfway. Add the garlic and shallots to the pan and continue to saute, keeping the mushrooms moving at all times. When the mushrooms are just cooked through add the fresh herbs to the pan and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Taste the mushrooms and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Cover and keep warm while you saute the scallops. Scallops: In a bowl, toss the sea scallops lightly in 1/2 cup canola oil. Season each scallop evenly on both sides with salt and pepper. Put a saute pan that is large enough to hold the scallops in 1 layer without them touching over high heat. Add enough canola oil to just cover the bottom of the pan. Allow the pan to preheat until you begin to see light wisps of smoke coming from the oil. Add the scallops to the pan carefully and allow them to get a deep golden brown color. Turn the scallops and allow the second side to get the same golden brown color. If you want the scallops to be more cooked, place the scallops in a preheated 350 degree F oven until they reach the desired doneness. Serve with mushrooms and drizzle with buerre blanc sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 7121,&quot;Hurricanes by the Pitcher 5 large lemons 1 1/2 cups sugar<br> 1 orange, sliced 1/4 inch thick, plus more for garnish 1 lime, halved lengthwise and sliced 1/4 inch thick, plus more for garnish 1 1/2 cups pulp-free orange juice 1 cup coconut water<br> 1 cup dark rum<br> 1 cup light rum<br> 3/4 cup grenadine<br> 3/4 cup pineapple juice<br> Maraschino cherries, for garnish Instructions: Use a vegetable peeler to remove 2 long strips of lemon peel, being careful not to take any of the white pith, which can be bitter. Juice the lemons; you should have 1 1/4 cups of juice. Put the lemon peel, sugar, 1 cup of the lemon juice and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard the lemon peel. Put the orange and lime slices in a large pitcher (or a clean stock pot if you are making an extra-large batch for family and friends). Using a wooden spoon or muddler, lightly bruise the citrus to release some of the juices and essential oils from the skins. Stir in the orange juice, coconut water, dark and light rum, grenadine, pineapple juice, the remaining 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 cup of the lemon syrup. (The remaining syrup can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 1 week.) Thread an orange slice, a lime slice and a maraschino cherry onto each of 8 small skewers. Fill 8 glasses with ice. Pour the hurricanes over the ice and rest a fruit skewer on each glass. Serve with tall bendy straws. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, C?tes du Rh?ne, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 7122,&quot;Linzer Star Sandwich Cookies 2 1/2 sticks lightly salted butter, plus more for greasing the baking sheet 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more flour for rolling the cookies 1/2 cup slivered almonds, ground 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 cup seedless raspberry jam Powdered sugar, for dusting cookies, optional<br> Instructions: For the cookie batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the butter until smooth. Add the granulated sugar and continue mixing until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, 5 to 8 minutes.<br> In another bowl, combine and mix the flour, almonds, cinnamon and nutmeg.<br> Mix and roll the cookies: Because this dough has a good amount of butter, it needs resting time and it needs to be rolled fairly quickly. Lay three large pieces of wax paper in a single layer on a flat surface. Sprinkle each one with a light coating of flour. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, blend the flour mixture in with the butter. When the ingredients are fully integrated, place one third of the batter on each of the pieces of wax paper. Coat with another light layer of flour and top with another piece of wax paper of the same length to make three dough \\sandwiches.\\ Press these wax-paper-and-dough-sandwiches down with your hands until the dough is fairly thin. This will save a lot of time on rolling later on. Place two of them in the refrigerator and work with them one at a time. Roll the first batch into as neat a shape as possible. What matters most is avoiding creases or cracks and getting it to about 1/8 inch in thickness. When the first is rolled, refrigerate it and repeat the same process for the other two. Let them chill at least 10 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Make the cookie bottoms: Remove the first rolled sheet from the refrigerator and cut as many 1 1/2-inch stars (or rounds) as you can. Reserve the scraps in the refrigerator. Arrange the stars neatly in a single layer on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with the other two sheets, reserving any scraps.<br> Make the cookie tops: Cut a star, with the smaller cutter, out of the center of half of all the cookies. Roll the scraps in between two of the pieces of wax paper and cut additional stars, if desired.<br> Bake and assemble the cookie sandwiches: Bake the cookies until they are lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the trays from the oven and allow them to cool slightly on the trays for a few minutes before gently transferring them to a flat surface. P Place the raspberry jam in a small pot and bring it to a light simmer. Remove from the heat to cool slightly. Spoon 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon raspberry jam on each bottom and place a top star squarely on each. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 7123,&quot;Brined Roast Rack of Pork with Apple Chutney and Sour Mash Sauce 6 cups water 1 container apple juice concentrate, thawed 1/2 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 Spanish onion, peeled and quartered 10 black peppercorns 10 mustard seeds 8 sprigs fresh thyme 2 bay leaves 1 (3 to 4-pound) center cut rack of pork, Frenched and fat removed 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups whiskey (recommended: Jack Daniels) 5 cups homemade chicken stock 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus parsley sprigs for garnish Apple-Ginger Chutney, recipe follows 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/4 medium Spanish onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger 1 cup fresh orange juice 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon honey 5 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced 1 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring the water, apple juice concentrate, salt, sugar, onion, peppercorns, mustard seeds, thyme and bay leaves to a simmer in a large stock pot and cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Let cool completely. Submerge the roast in the brine by placing a plate on top, then cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper and cook on both sides until golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the pork to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven until cooked to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10 minutes.<br> While the pork is roasting, add the whiskey to the saute pan that the pork was cooked in, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, and cook until almost completely reduced. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced to a sauce consistency. Whisk in the butter, season with salt and pepper, and stir in the parsley.<br> Cut pork into chops, top each chop with some of the Apple-Ginger Chutney, and drizzle a little of the sauce around the pork chop and over the chutney. Garnish with parsley sprig. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute. Increase the heat to high, then add the orange juice, brown sugar, and honey and bring to a simmer. Stir in the apples, allspice, and salt and pepper, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the apples are soft and the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Serve with the pork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 7124,&quot;Country Pate 1 pound plus 1-ounce lean veal or chicken 8 ounces lean pork 14 ounces fatback 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon white pepper 1/2 cup applejack, calvados, or brandy 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 4 ounces chicken livers, trimmed 1 tablespoon pureed garlic 1/4 cup brandy 2 1/2 bay leaves 1 slice day-old white bread, crusts removed 2 teaspoons ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 3 small eggs 1/2 pound bacon, sliced 1/4 pound baked ham 1/4 pound pickled tongue 4 bay leaves for garnish 5 garlic cloves, peeled Instructions: Trim veal or chicken and pork of excess fat and tendons. Skin fatback. Cut into 1 inch cubes and pass through largest hole of a meat grinder. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in salt, pepper, and applejack. Cover with plastic wrap touching the mixture and refrigerate at least 1 day or as long as 3. After marinating, heat oil in a medium skillet over high heat. Saute livers until well browned, about 1 minute per side. Remove from pan and set aside to cool. Add garlic and cook about 1/2 minute, being careful not to let it color. Reserve garlic with liver. Add brandy and bay leaves to same skillet. Scrape bottom of pan to loosen brown bits and cook over low heat until warm, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool and remove and discard bay leaves. Dip white bread in warm water to soften. Squeeze out excess moisture. Add to the liver and garlic along with 2 cups marinated ground meat, allspice, nutmeg, and brandy. Stir to combine. Transfer to a food processor, add eggs, and puree until a smooth paste is formed. This paste will bind the pate. Place puree in a large bowl, add remaining ground meat, and combine well. (We recommend using your hands, not a spoon, to combine this dense mixture.) Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 9 by 5 by 3 inch glass or ceramic loaf pan with bacon slices so they overhang lengthwise, about 3 inches on each end. Slice ham and tongue into 4 by 1/2 by 1/2 inch julienne strips. Spread about a cup of pate evenly over the bacon to cover the bottom. Arrange alternating strips of ham and tongue lengthwise, over the pate. Repeat this procedure, alternating pate with strips of ham and tongue, until pan is filled and top layer is pate. (When the loaf is sliced you will see a regular pattern of solids and pate.) Fold overhanging bacon over the top. (The pate may rise slightly over the top of the pan. That&#39;s OK.) Tap pan against a counter to firmly pack. Garnish top with bay leaves and garlic cloves. Cover with 2 layers aluminum foil, tucking edges under to completely seal. Place inside a larger pan and pour in boiling water until it rises halfway up the sides of the pate. Bake 2 hours 15 minutes. Set aside to cool. Place cooled pate on a baking sheet and cover with another baking sheet. Top with some 3 pounds of weights (canned goods or milk cartons are good) and refrigerate overnight or as long as 2 weeks. This compacts the pate and makes it easier to slice. To serve, remove and discard the bay leaf and garlic garnish. To loosen, dip pan&#39;s bottom in warm water and run a knife along inside edges. Invert onto a serving platter. Cut into 1/2 inch slices and serve on lettuce leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7125,&quot;Roasted Tomato-Bread Soup 1 pound vine-ripened tomatoes, quartered and seeded 3 tablespoons garlic-infused extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup finely sliced fresh basil leaves, plus more leaves for garnish 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes (recommended: San Marzano) 1 1/2 cups water 1/2 loaf sourdough baguette (day-old) or 1/4 loaf country bread, torn into 1/2-inch pieces (about 3 cups) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet, toss with 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Roast until the tomatoes are softened and the edges are beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the garlic oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the basil and stir for about 30 seconds. Add the canned tomatoes with their juice and the water; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the bread and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.

When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the carrots and season with salt and black pepper. Using a wooden spoon, stir the carrots to coat with the oil and seasonings. After the carrots have cooked for a few minutes, add the brown sugar and molasses and continue to cook, stirring from time to time. Add a little water so they can become tender without burning the sugar. Continue to cook until tender, about 5 to 8 minutes. Add more water, if needed, but the sauce should be thick enough to coat the carrots and should bubble around the edges of the pan. The carrots should be tender and fairly yielding when pierced with the tip of a knife. Add the butter and the rosemary sprig. Once the butter has melted remove the rosemary sprig and discard. Transfer the carrots to a serving bowl and garnish with chopped carrot tops.

Turn down to a simmer and cover. Cook until the meat is very tender, about 4 hours. Strain the short ribs from the liquid and put the meat in a mixing bowl. Before it cools, grab tongs and shred it. Return the meat to the liquid. For the pickled red onions: Meanwhile, combine vinegar, salt, sugar and 3 cups water in a pot over high heat. Put onions in a heat-safe container. Once the pickling liquid comes to a rolling boil, turn off the heat and pour it over the onions. Make sure you use a container that will cover the red onions completely with the liquid; weigh down the onions with a plate if necessary. Let it sit at room temp so the color bleeds out from the red onions, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate. (Pickled onions can be used as soon as they are cold, but they are best after at least 3 days.) For the purgatory crema: Combine sour cream, lemon and lime juices, mirin and vinegar in a mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly until smooth. For the grilled cheese: Preheat a toaster oven or regular oven to 350 degrees F. Spread purgatory crema on both sides of the slices of bread, then put down mozzarella on one side and Cheddar on the other. Bake until the cheese melts. Meanwhile, heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the short rib and some pickled red onions to the bread and sandwich them together. Add a bit of oil to the pan, then put the sandwich in the pan. Grill until crispy golden brown on both sides. Repeat with remaining ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, GSM Blend, Tempranillo]&quot; 7141,&quot;Sour Cream Coffee Cake with Peach Preserves and Lemon Glaze 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of fine salt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more, for the pan 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup sour cream 2/3 cup peach preserves 3/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Instructions: For the crumb topping: Put the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a small bowl and stir to combine. Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat together the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just incorporated. Spoon half of the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Dollop the peach preserves on top and carefully smooth with the spatula. Spoon the remaining cake batter on top and smooth the top. Sprinkle on the crumb topping. Bake until the cake and topping are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan 20 minutes, then invert onto a plate; invert back onto a rack to cool completely. For the glaze: When the cake is cool, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and lemon juice and zest in a medium bowl until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cake and let set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7142,&quot;Tempura Fried Squash Blossoms with Tomato Sauce 1/4 cup rice flour 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 cup cornstarch 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon cayenne 3 cups soda water 1 (8-ounce) log mild goat cheese, softened 5 sprigs thyme, leaves removed and chopped 2 tablespoons chopped chervil 2 tablespoons chopped chives 1 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 16 squash blossoms Tomato Sauce, recipe follows Fried Basil Leaves, recipe follows 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons 1/4 cup finely chopped onion 1 tablespoon chopped garlic Pinch chili flakes 2 cups peeled, seeded, and diced tomatoes Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon sugar 4 thyme sprigs, leaves removed and chopped 4 basil leaves, chiffonade Vegetable oil or peanut oil 8 basil leaves Instructions: Tempura Batter: Sift together all of the dry ingredients. Whisk in the soda water, a little at a time, until the right consistency is achieved. The batter should coat the back of a spoon, but some excess batter should run off the spoon. Allow to rest in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before use. Goat Cheese Filling: Combine all of the ingredients and mix well. Shape the mixture into 1 tablespoon balls. Make sure the squash blossoms are well cleaned. Open the flowers and insert 1 goat cheese ball in each flower. Gently press the filling into the base of the flower. Cover with the petals and pinch the top to seal. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat a fryer or a deep pot halfway filled with peanut oil to 375 degrees F. Hold the squash blossoms by the stem. Dip each into the tempura batter, making sure to coat completely. Let any excess batter drip off. Place the blossom in the oil and fry until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes, turning often to brown evenly. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Place some of the Tomato Sauce on the bottom of a plate. Top with 2 squash blossoms and garnish with Fried Basil leaves. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and heat. Add the onion, garlic, and chili flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Lower the heat and cook until the tomatoes start to disintegrate and mixture is of sauce consistency, about 15 minutes. Add the thyme, basil, and remaining olive oil and mix well. Heat about 1/2-inch of the oil in a steep-sided saute pan to 350 degrees F. Or heat a deep fryer to 350 degrees F. Pat the basil leaves dry to remove any surface water. Carefully drop the basil leaves in the hot oil. The oil will spit and splatter as the moisture in the leaves fries. Fry for 10 seconds or just until the leaves start to become translucent. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7143,&quot;Linguine al Pesto (Linguine with Pesto Sauce and Potato) 1 pound fresh or dried linguine 1 boiling potato, peeled and cubed 1 cup pesto (see below) 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, for serving Freshly ground black pepper, for serving 2 cloves garlic 3/4 cups pine nuts Salt Leaves fromo 1 bunch basil, about 1/4 pound, well washed and dried 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1/2 cup grated hard pecorino cheese Instructions: When cooking the pasta, add a potato to the salted water. This trick returns to the pasta the starch it tends to lose in draining, thus preventing the linguine from clumping. Drain the pasta cubes along with the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water. Transfer the pasta and potato to a large bowl and dress them with the pesto and butter. If the pasta looks too dry, add a little of the reserved cooking water. Serve in individual dishes, topping each with grated Parmesan cheese and pepper. If using a food processor, put the garlic, pine nuts, a pinch of salt, the basil, and the oil into the bowl and process it until the ingredients form a smooth paste. Add the Parmesan and the pecorino and pulse just to combine. Taste and adjust the salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Gavi, Barbera]&quot; 7144,&quot;Spiced Pecans 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon dried ground orange peel 1 pound pecan halves 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons water Instructions: Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. Mix the salt, cumin, cayenne, cinnamon and orange peel together in a small bowl and set aside. Place the nuts in a 10-inch cast iron skillet and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes until they just start to brown and smell toasted. Add the butter and stir until it melts. Add the spice mixture and stir to combine. Once combined, add both sugars and water, stirring until the mixture thickens and coats the nuts, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the nuts to the prepared sheetpan and separate them with a fork or spatula. Allow the nuts to cool completely before transferring to an airtight container for storage. Can be stored up to 3 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 7145,&quot;Pan-Roasted Chicken with Port and Whole-Grain Mustard 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 whole frying chicken, 3 to 4 pounds, butterflied 1/2 cup port wine 1/2 cup chicken stock or 2 tablespoons BBQ sauce 1/3 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon Meaux (whole grain) mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped tarragon leaves Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the chicken over high heat. Add the olive oil and swirl it in the skillet. As soon as you begin to see slight wisps of smoke, carefully place the chicken skin side down in the skillet. Sear the chicken, undisturbed, while reducing the heat little by little to medium, until its skin has turned golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully turn the chicken skin side up. Put the skillet into the oven and cook until the chicken is deep golden brown and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with a skewer, about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on its size. When the chicken is done, transfer it to the plate and keep warm. Pour off all but a thin layer of fat from the skillet. Add the port, put the skillet over high heat, and reduce until half remains. Add the chicken stock and reduce again. (If using BBQ sauce, you don&#39;t have to reduce.) Add the cream, bring it to a boil, and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the Dijon and Meaux mustards and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Return the chicken to the skillet and sprinkle with parsley and tarragon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7146,&quot;Jerk Plantain Seared Triple Tail, Chocolate Calypso Beans, Red Guava and Carambola Salad 2 pounds calypso beans 2 cups medium-diced onion<br> 2 poblano peppers, medium dice<br> 10 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 4 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon cumin<br> 1/2 tablespoon crushed red peppers<br> 1 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3 quarts chicken stock<br> Two 12-ounce bottles brown ale beer, such as Cigar City Maduro<br> 2 melting discs Mexican chocolate, such as Taza (about 2.7 ounces each)<br> Salt 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon ground allspice, toasted<br> 3/4 tablespoon dark rum<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 4 cloves garlic<br> 1 1/2 bunches green onion, chopped<br> 1/2 habanero pepper, seeded and deveined<br> 4 green plantains 1 fresh lime, juiced<br> Salt Four 6-ounce portions fresh fish, such as triple tail, snapper or grouper 1 to 2 tablespoons clarified butter<br> 2 large shallots, thinly sliced on a mandoline 1 cup peeled and julienned jicama<br> 1 cup sugar<br> 1 cup white vinegar<br> 2 red guavas, peeled, quartered and julienned 1 carambola (starfruit), discolored edges removed, julienned<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro<br> 1 tablespoon key lime juice<br> 2 teaspoons olive oil<br> Salt<br> Instructions: For the chocolate calypso beans: Rinse the beans.

But there&#39;s nothing to be scared of-making great duck just takes patience. To get a really beautiful, crackling, brown piece of skin you have to take your time and render the fat SLOWLY. If you rush it, you&#39;ll end up with crispy skin but a thick layer of fat between the skin and the meat-which is totally icky. Taking your time to render the fat will not only make your duck absolutely delicious, but it will also leave you with a treasure trove of duck fat-an ingredient that in restaurant kitchens is considered liquid gold and makes killer duck fat potatoes. I think that duck lends itself to sweet flavors, so in this dish I use a sweet Tuscan wine-Vin Santo-to reconstitute dried fruit to make a chutney-like sauce with rich chicken stock. Together the rich, meaty, succulent duck and the intense, fruity sauce make this dish perfect for a holiday, a special occasion, or even a Tuesday. In a small bowl, soak the apricots, apples, and cherries in the Vin Santo. Using a knife, cut or score the fat of the duck breasts in a crosshatched pattern, cutting through the fat, down to the meat, but not into the meat (this allows the fat to escape more easily as it cooks). Season generously with salt. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a large saute pan with about a tablespoon of olive oil. Place the duck breasts skin side down in the pan (be sure that the duck fits in the pan comfortably and is not crowded). Bring the pan to low heat and render the fat from the duck breasts. This needs to be done S-L-O-W-L-Y; otherwise the fat will be sealed into the skin and will not render out. This process will take about 20 to 25 minutes, maybe more. As the fat builds up in the pan, scoop it out, but SAVE IT! When the fat has rendered from the breasts you will see the meat through the score marks. At this point, crank up the heat and brown both sides of the duck, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Then move the duck to a rimmed baking sheet and place it in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes for medium-rare. Remove any remaining fat from the pan and set the pan aside to make the sauce (look at me-saving you dishes!). Remove the duck from the oven and let rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. Strain the Vin Santo from the dried fruit, add it to the saute pan, bring to medium-high heat, and reduce it until it&#39;s almost a syrup. Add 1/2 cup of the chicken stock, all the dried fruit, and the thyme leaves to the pan; season with salt. When the chicken stock has reduced and the sauce looks kind of chunky, add the remaining chicken stock; bring to a boil (BTB), cook for 2 to 3 minutes, and turn off the heat. Taste to make sure the sauce is yummy and reseason if needed. Slice each duck breast on the bias, fan the meat on a plate, and spoon some of the sauce on and around the duck. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 7164,&quot;Hasselback Apples 3 large Pink Lady or Fuji apples, peeled, halved and cored 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 5 tablespoons light brown sugar 3 tablespoons rolled oats<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 pint Madagascar bourbon vanilla ice cream<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place an apple half cut-side down on a cutting board and cut thin vertical slices into it, being careful not to slice all the way through. Repeat the process with the remaining apple halves. Transfer the apples to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepot. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar until fully incorporated. Pour the butter and sugar mixture over the apples. Bake until the apples have softened, 18 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the streusel topping. In a small bowl, add the oats, flour, cinnamon, salt, remaining 2 tablespoons butter and remaining 3 tablespoons brown sugar. Using a fork or your hands, work the mixture together until it forms a large crumble. Top each baked apple with the streusel topping, making sure to get some in between the apple slices. Return the dish to the oven and bake until the topping is golden brown, another 10 to 15 minutes. Serve the apples with a scoop of the ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7165,&quot;Shrimp Noodle Bowl 8 cups low-sodium chicken stock 2 cups frozen peas 2 cups frozen carrot slices 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons Szechuan stir-fry sauce (recommended: San-J) 10 ounces fresh yaki-soba or ramen noodles 1 pound cooked medium shrimp Instructions: To a large pot over medium-high heat, add all ingredients except noodles and shrimp.

Squeeze in the lemon and drop the halves in, then add the white wine, garlic, bay leaves, thyme bundle, crushed red pepper and some salt. Drop the lobsters into the boiling water, cover and cook for 11 to 15 minutes. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. Remove the lobsters to the ice water to stop the cooking, then remove and let cool. For the lobster rolls: Remove the meat from the lobster claws, knuckles and tails and discard the shells. Coarsely chop the meat and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the celery, chives, lemon juice, celery salt and 1/2 cup mayonnaise and stir to combine well. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of mayo if you like the mix a little creamier (this is traditionally a very low mayo type deal). Taste to make sure the lobster is delicious; reserve. Toss the butter and garlic into a large saute pan and melt the butter. When the butter is melted, bubbly and very garlicky smelling, discard the garlic clove. Add the hot dog rolls to the pan and cook in the garlic butter on both sides until the butter is absorbed and the rolls are crispy on both sides. Divide the reserved lobster mixture among the 4 buttered rolls and serve immediately with the Red Cabbage Slaw. Place the cabbage in a large bowl, add the vinegar and season with salt. Stir to combine, then set aside for at least 1 hour. This will soften the cabbage and make it seem almost cooked but still with a great texture. Drain the cabbage and return to a large bowl. Add the carrots, onions, mayonnaise and mustard. Taste for seasoning; the final outcome should be a creamy and tart slaw. Serve cold or at room temperature.

Add the milk chocolate and bittersweet chocolate and mix on medium speed until fully incorporated, scraping down the bowl as you go. For the toffee: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place a clean silicone mat on another 12-by-18-inch sheet pan. Combine the sugar, corn syrup and cream in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat without stirring. Add the butter and begin to stir until the caramel turns the color of peanut butter. Pour immediately onto the prepared baking sheet and bake until the toffee turns a deep amber color and spreads thinly on the pan, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool, then chop into tiny pieces that will be easy to chew. To assemble: Fill a pastry bag with some of the milk chocolate frosting. Top 2 mini cake rounds with frosting and about 2 teaspoons of chopped toffee. Stack these on top of each other and top with an unfrosted round of cake. Wrap the small cylinder in plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining cake rounds. Freeze until the frosting has set, about 30 minutes. Place a small cake on a revolving cake stand and pipe on the frosting to cover completely. With a small offset spatula, even out the surfaces of the little cake and swirl the frosting in a pretty, decorative pattern of your choice. Top each mini cake with crushed toffee and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7226,&quot;Old-Fashioned American Meatloaf 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for baking dish 1/2 cup finely chopped scallions (white and green parts)<br> 1/4 cup grated carrots<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped onion<br> 1 teaspoon dried thyme<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/2 cup ketchup<br> 2 teaspoons gelatin<br> 2 pounds ground beef chuck<br> 1/2 pound ground pork<br> 2 large eggs, beaten<br> 1/2 cup dried bread crumbs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup ketchup 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard<br> Instructions: To make the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Reserve the piece. Set the watermelon cut-side down on a work surface. To make the jaws and teeth: Find the brown dot that grows at the top center of the watermelon. Measure about 1 inch down and cut a large wedge from the side to make the gaping jaws of the shark. Reserve the wedge.<br> Cut a 1-inch-wide strip of paper. Use the paper as a guide to lightly draw a 1-inch line at the top and bottom of the shark&#39;s jaws with a pen or marker. Use a Y-shaped vegetable peeler and a paring knife to trim away the green and make 2 bands of white, taking care not to poke all the way through. Cut and scoop out the watermelon flesh, keeping the pieces as large as possible. Leave about an inch or so of flesh in the bottom of the mouth to act as a bowl to hold the fruit. Use a paring knife to cut triangles out of the white bands along the jaw to make teeth.<br> To make the fin: Cut out a 3 1/2-inch-high fin from the reserved bottom piece of watermelon. Cut off the flesh so one side is white and the other is green. Attach the fin with 2 toothpicks about 2 to 3 inches up from the bottom of the watermelon. (Tip: Use a small meat mallet to gently hammer in the toothpicks if the watermelon is very hard.) To make the eyes: Cut 2 eye-shaped ovals, about 3 inches long and 2 inches high, out of paper. Toothpick them to the shark about 2 inches up from the fin and about 3 inches apart. Lightly trace around the outside of the paper with a pen or marker, then remove the paper. Use a paring knife to cut out the rind on the inside of the eyes, taking care to cut only into the white of the rind without exposing the flesh. Cut 2 strips of the rind to create menacing eyebrows. Attach a blueberry with a toothpick towards the front of each eye. Stick a second toothpick above each eye to attach the eyebrow.<br> Cut any large pieces of reserved watermelon flesh into planks and use the cutters to make fish. Peel the cantaloupe and honeydew and slice down the sides of the melon until you get to the seeds to make planks. Cut into more fish. Save any melon scraps for another use.

Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 7250,&quot;Chocolate Devils Baking spray, for spraying parchment 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) butter<br> 4 heaping tablespoons cocoa<br> 1/2 cup buttermilk<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> 2 eggs, beaten<br> 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup milk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) butter<br> 1 cup granulated sugar (not powdered sugar!)<br> 3 cups heavy cream 2 teaspoons vanilla<br> 24 ounces semisweet chocolate, broken into pieces<br> 1 jar maraschino cherries Instructions: For the best chocolate sheet cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Use an 18-by-13-inch sheet cake pan. Cut parchment paper to fit the pan and spray each side with baking spray. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt. In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the cocoa to the butter and stir together. Add 1 cup boiling water to the pan and then allow the mixture to boil for 30 seconds. Pour over the flour mixture, and stir lightly to cool. Pour the buttermilk into a bowl and add the baking soda, vanilla and beaten eggs. Stir the buttermilk mixture into the butter/flour mixture. Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake for 20 minutes. Let the cake cool completely. Cut the cooled cake into circles with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, and then lay the circles on another sheet pan with a wire rack; set this pan in the fridge to make sure there is no warmth to the cake at all. (The frosting is so light and fluffy, the coolness will help keep it all together.) For the white frosting: In a small saucepan, whisk the flour into the milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. You want it to be very thick--thicker than cake mix, more like a brownie mix. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. If in a hurry, place the saucepan over ice in the sink for about 10 minutes or so until the mixture cools. It must be completely cool before you use it in the next step. Stir in the vanilla. While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. You don&#39;t want any sugar graininess left. Then add the completely cooled milk/flour mixture and beat the living daylights out of it. If it looks separated, you haven&#39;t beaten it enough! Beat it until it all combines and resembles whipped cream. Grab a spoon and taste this wonderful goodness. If there is any left after your taste test, spread it on a cooled chocolate cake. For the ganache: Heat the cream until very hot. Add the vanilla, and then pour over the chocolate pieces. Stir to completely melt. To assemble: Place the white frosting into a frosting bag. Squeeze the frosting onto one circle of cake. Press a second circle on top. Using a ladle, pour ganache over the cake, allowing the chocolate to run over the sides. Place 3 cherries on the center. Repeat the process with each cake. Chill the cakes until ready to serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 7251,&quot;Chicken Enchiladas 3 tablespoons butter 1/3 cup broken spaghetti or orzo 2 cloves garlic, peeled 1 small to medium onion, peeled 1 ripe tomato 1 cup long-grain rice 4 dried guajillo cl peppers or dried red New Mexico cl peppers, stemmed 2 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil Generous pinch saffron Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 small to medium onion, chopped 1 large bay leaf 1 cinnamon stick One 32-ounce can tomato sauce 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted and ground 1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil 1 1/2 pounds ground chicken 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 12 corn tortillas, warmed or charred 8 ounces queso fresco, crumbled Handful fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped Instructions: For the rice: Heat the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.

For the coconut filling: Pop the coconut in the oven and bake until it starts to crack, about 1 hour. Let cool and remove the outer shell. Reserve the coconut milk for another use, such as Adobo Pork Shanks with Fried Rice. Using a food processor, reduce the flesh to a fine powder. Spread 2 cups coconut on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Toast in the oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool. For the lime shortbread crust: Pulse the all-purpose flour, confectioners&#39; sugar and lime zest in a food processor to combine. Add the butter and pulse until coarse crumbs form. Add the egg yolks and process just until the dough forms a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and fit into an 8- to 9-inch (20 to 23 centimeter) tart pan with a removable bottom. You can use your fingertips to evenly press the dough onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Finish the coconut filling: Beat the almond flour, butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and toasted coconut with a mixer until creamy. Add the eggs and beat until pale and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the coconut filling into the pie shell. Refrigerate for 1 hour. (This will help prevent the crust from shrinking while it bakes.) Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake the tart until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool. For the pineapple jam: Bring the sugar and 1 cup (250ml) water to a simmer in a saucepan over high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat to low, add the pineapple and cardamom seeds and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spread the pineapple jam over the cooled tart. Garnish with coconut shavings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 7256,&quot;Salt and Pepper Red Crab: Cua Rang Muoi 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon fine white pepper 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon five spice powder 2 (14 ounce/400 g each) live crabs, blue swimmer or mud crab Vegetable oil, for deep-frying Potato starch, for dusting 3 red Asian shallots, finely diced 2 cloves garlic, finely diced 3 spring onions (scallions), cut into 2-inch/5 cm lengths 2 long red chiles, thinly sliced on the diagonal Serving suggestion: Jasmine rice. Instructions: For the seasoning mix: In a bowl, mix salt, white pepper, sugar, and five spice pepper together. To prepare your crabs humanely, place them in the freezer for 1 hour to put them to sleep, or submerge them in an ice bath for 5 minutes. Remove the upper shell of the crab, pick off the gills, which look like little fingers, and discard them. Clean the crab under running water and drain. Place the crab on its stomach and chop the crab in 1/2 with a heavy cleaver. Now chop each 1/2 into 4 pieces, chopping each piece after each leg. With the back of the cleaver gently crack each claw - this makes it easier to extract the meat. Heat the oil in a wok to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C, or until a cube of bread dropped into the oil browns in 5 seconds. Dust the crab pieces with potato starch, shaking off the excess. Deep-fry the crab in batches for 3 minutes, turning over once, until golden brown. Remove from the wok and drain on kitchen paper towels. Remove the oil, reserving 2 tablespoons, and clean the wok. Heat the reserved oil in the wok, then add the shallots and garlic and fry until fragrant. Return the crab to the wok and toss all ingredients together well, adding the salt and pepper seasoning mix to taste. Serve with jasmine rice and finger bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 7257,&quot;Grilled Hearts of Romaine 2 hearts romaine lettuce 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the grill or a grill pan.<br> Cut each heart of romaine in half lengthwise, leaving the end intact so each half holds together. Cut the tops of the lettuce, if necessary. Brush with olive oil and grill over medium heat until the lettuce chars and wilts slightly, about 6 minutes, turning a few times. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7258,&quot;Blueberry Maple Syrup 3 cups blueberries 1 cup maple syrup Instructions: Combine 1 1/2 cups berries and syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Remove from heat, strain to remove blueberry solids, stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups berries, and use to top pancakes, waffles, or French toast. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 7259,&quot;Almond Apricot Tart 1/3 cup sugar 2/3 cup slivered almonds, slightly toasted 6 tablespoons butter 1 eggs 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 1 1/2 tablespoons flour 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed 6 fresh or canned apricot halves, pits removed 1/4 cup whole almonds, skin on Confectioners&#39; sugar, for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. To make the frangipane, place the almonds and the sugar in a food processor and grind until sandy. Add the butter and continue mixing then add the egg, vanilla, and the flour and mix until smooth. To make the tart, on a floured work surface pass your rolling pin over the pastry just to flatten any ridges. Place it on a parchment paper lined sheet pan and cut out a 9-inch disk. Spread the almond frangipane in the center of the tart leaving a 1-inch border. Firmly place the apricot halves into the frangipane spacing them evenly around the tart. Dot the spaces between the apricots with the whole almonds. Bake until golden brown on the top and puffy, about 30 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 7260,&quot;Rosemary-Skewered Swordfish Kebabs 11/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 11/2 tablespoons grated lemon zest (from 2 medium lemons) 11/2 tablespoons grated orange zest 1 tablespoon chopped thyme Four 12-inch rosemary branches, leaves removed and chopped, branches reserved (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 pounds swordfish, cut into approximately 16 cubes Instructions: Pour 1/4 cup oil into a wide, shallow, nonreactive dish.

Add the meat and sear for 2 1/2 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Off the heat, sprinkle steaks with brandy. Return the pan to the heat, and flambe. (Depending upon the thickness of the meat, the cooking time of the steaks may vary.) Sauce au Poivre: Place the black pepper in a dry small saucepan and toast over medium-high heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the oil and stir to combine. Add the shallots and green peppercorns, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat, add the brandy, return to the heat to flambe, then simmer until reduced by three-quarters. Add the mustard and stir to combine, then add the veal reduction and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by half, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the salt. Serve hot. Place 3 tournedos on each serving plate. Drizzle with the sauce and serve with the herb-roasted potatoes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the bones in a large roasting pan and toss with the oil. Roast, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and spread the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic over the bones. Smear the tomato paste over the vegetables and return the pan to the oven. Roast for another 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and pour off the fat from the pan. Transfer the bones and vegetables to a large stockpot. Do not discard the juices in the roasting pan. Add the water, bay leaves, thyme, salt, and peppercorns to the stockpot and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, place the roasting pan over 2 burners on medium-high heat. Add the wine and stir with a heavy wooden spoon to deglaze and dislodge any browned bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. Add the contents to the stockpot. When the liquid returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 8 hours, skimming occasionally to remove any foam that rises to the surface. Ladle through a fine-mesh strainer into a large clean pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a gentle boil, and cook, uncovered, until reduced to 6 cups in volume, about 1 hour. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove any congealed fat from the surface of the stock. The stock can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or frozen in airtight containers for up to 2 months. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Microwave, uncovered, on high (at 100 percent power) until the butter has melted, 45 seconds in an 1,100-watt oven or 1 minute in a 700-watt oven. If the butter has not melted, microwave it again in 5-second increments. Add 1/4 cup of the flour, brown sugar, almonds, oats, cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon salt, and toss together with a fork until all the dry ingredients are moistened, leaving large clumps. Spread out the streusel in a single layer. Microwave, uncovered, on high (at 100 percent power) for 3 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 4 minutes in a 700-watt oven, stirring halfway through. Remove the dish from the microwave, and stir. The streusel should be golden brown; if it&#39;s too light, microwave again, uncovered, in 15-second increments. Set aside. In a microwave-safe 1-quart shallow baking dish, toss together the cherries, the remaining 2 teaspoons flour, granulated sugar, lemon juice, vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Dot with the remaining butter pieces. Microwave, uncovered, on high (at 100 percent power) for 16 minutes in an 1,100-watt oven or 28 minutes in a 700-watt oven. Stir the cherry mixture. The juices will be the color of deep-red wine and should be looser than you expect, about the consistency of real maple syrup (they will thicken as they cool). If they seem too loose, microwave again, uncovered, on high (at 100 percent power) in 1-minute increments. Let the cherry mixture sit for 10 minutes, as it will be too hot to eat right away. Sprinkle with the reserved streusel topping, and serve. Scatter half the butter pieces in a microwave-safe 9-inch pie dish.

Prepare the cake mixes; divide the batter between the bowls. Bake at 325 degrees F, about 45 minutes for the small bowl and about 55 minutes for the large bowl. Let cool, then remove from the bowls. Make the frosting: Heat the sugar with the cream of tartar, salt and 1/3 cup water in a saucepan, stirring, until dissolved. Beat the egg whites with a mixer until frothy. Slowly beat in the hot sugar mixture, then beat until stiff peaks form, about 7 minutes. Remove about 2 cups of the frosting to a small bowl and fold in enough yellow food coloring to make a bright egg yolk color (about 8 to 10 drops); set aside. Set the cakes rounded-side down. Trim the tops with a serrated knife so the cakes sit at the same height. Flip the cakes over and slice off a 3-inch piece from each one as shown; reserve the trimmings. Line up the cut sides of the cakes, then trim the sides of the smaller cake as shown to make an oval shape. Flip the cakes over. Use a little white frosting to stick the cakes together, then cover completely with a thin layer of frosting; freeze 20 minutes. Cover with the remaining white frosting, making it as smooth as possible. Crumble the reserved cake trimmings and mix with just enough of the prepared yellow frosting to moisten. Clump the mixture together and mound on the wider end of the cake to form the yolk. Put the remaining yellow frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.

Bring a small pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the tteok and cook, stirring constantly to prevent sticking, until soft but bouncy, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander. If any of the tteok stick together, separate them with a wet hand. Cool slightly until ready to handle. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Meanwhile, cut the imitation crab sticks, scallions, danmuji and smoked fish ham the same size as the tteok. To assemble, thread the ingredients on the skewers, about 1/4 inch from the end of each ingredient rather than down the center, as follows: imitation crab stick, scallion, danmuji, fish ham, tteok and a second crab stick. Line up each layer and push the layers close together. Lay the finished skewers on a baking dish or plate in one layer. Add the flour to a large rimmed plate and whisk the eggs in a medium bowl. Heat a large nonstick skillet with 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-low heat. One at a time, dredge all the skewers in the flour, coating them well on all sides; leave the dredged skewers on the baking dish. Working with one dredged skewer, shake off any excess flour, then dip and roll the skewer around in the eggs, making sure to coat it thoroughly with no flour peeping through. Place the skewer in the skillet; most of the egg will slide and drip to the bottom, creating a desirable \\u201cskirt,\\ which will secure and glue the layers together. Repeat with 2 more skewers, or as many as will fit in the skillet without crowding. Cook, undisturbed, until light golden underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until the other side is light golden, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the skewers to a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack and keep warm in the oven. Wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel and heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium-low heat. Repeat with the remaining floured skewers, dipping and rolling each one in the egg right before adding it to the skillet. Cook until light golden on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. For the dipping sauce: Whisk the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, gochugaru, if using, and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Serve the skewers immediately with the dipping sauce. You can also slide the ingredients off the skewers right before serving if you prefer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7280,&quot;Pompidou Potato Leek Soup 6 potatoes, peeled and cut into large pieces 8 leeks, whites only, soaked in salt water to remove grit 3 stalks celery, roughly chopped 1 medium onion, peeled and quartered 1 bay leaf 2 quarts chicken stock 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup (4 ounces or 1 stick) melted butter 1 cup heavy cream 1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves Salt and pepper Instructions: To a large pot add potatoes, 4 of the leeks, celery, onion, bay leaf and chicken stock.

Add the garlic, shallots and fresh ginger and saute until fragrant and the shallots are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the soy sauce, sugar, tamarind paste, fish sauce, sambal and 1/2 cup water. Stir well and cook until the mixture is slightly reduced and has a maple syrup-like consistency, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm until ready to serve. Preheat 4 to 5 inches of canola oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven or deep wok. You need enough oil so the whole fish can be submerged. Prepare the fish: Make 3 diagonal slices into the flesh of one side of the snapper, cutting all the way to the bone and spacing the slices 2 inches apart. Repeat with the other side of the fish. Combine the cornstarch, rice flour, granulated garlic, ground ginger, salt and pepper in a large baking dish. Lightly dredge the fish all over with the seasoned flour, including inside the cuts. Shake off any excess flour, then form the fish into an \\S\\ curve by threading two 12-inch bamboo skewers through the tail and body so it holds its wavy shape. Carefully place the fish into the hot oil so it is almost completely submerged. Fry the fish until deep golden and very crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. As it cooks, use a large metal spoon or ladle to carefully pour hot oil over any exposed part of the fish to ensure it cooks evenly. Carefully remove the fish from the oil and place on a wire rack to drain briefly. Season immediately with salt and lime juice. Carefully remove the skewers from the fish, and place it upright on a platter of Coconut-Cilantro Rice Pilaf. Pour the ginger tamarind sauce over the top. Garnish with the chilies and scallions. Rinse the rice by running it under cold water 2 or 3 times until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and ensures the rice comes out light and fluffy. Heat the canola oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the chili flakes and rice and stir well to coat the kernels evenly with oil. Add the coconut milk, salt, sugar and 1 cup water. Stir well and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook until all the liquid has absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Turn off the heat, keep covered and allow the rice to sit for 5 minutes to steam. Before serving, add the cilantro and fluff with a fork.

Bring to a boil over medium heat and add a generous pinch of salt. Cook for 8 minutes so they are tender but still slightly firm. Strain and let them cool. When they are cool, cut them in half and carefully scoop out the insides using a teaspoon or melon baller to form a cup. (Reserve the scooped out insides for Round 2 Recipe Shrimp and Potato Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon Dressing). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the potato cups into a large bowl, add the oil, rosemary and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Carefully toss the potato cups to coat them with the oil. Arrange the potatoes, cut side up, on a baking sheet and bake until the cups are browned and crisp, about 15 to 20 minutes. While the potatoes are baking, put the bacon into a cold skillet and cook over medium heat until crisp. Drain the bacon well on a baking sheet lined with a brown paper bag. (Reserve 2 pieces of bacon for Round 2 Recipe Shrimp and Potato Salad with Sour Cream and Bacon Dressing.) Chop the remaining 6 pieces.

Combine the flour, baking powder, 1 tablespoon of the za&#39;atar, the sugar and salt in a medium bowl using a whisk. Using a bowl scraper or your fingers, mix in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal; using your fingers will create a more cake-like texture. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk. Stir until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead 5 or 6 times. Roll the dough into a 1-inch-thick disc and cut out biscuits using a 3-inch biscuit cutter. Make sure you don&#39;t twist the cutter otherwise you&#39;ll squish the sides and the biscuit won&#39;t rise. Knead the scraps together, re-roll and cut out biscuits until all the dough has been used. Place the biscuits bottom-side up on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Whisk together the vegetable oil with the remaining 1 tablespoon za&#39;atar and brush the mixture on each biscuit. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7300,&quot;Viennese Vanilla Cookies 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups sifted flour 1 1/4 cups shaved Almonds (not the slivered almonds, but the flat cuts w/ bits of brown on them) 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 teaspoon salt Confectioner&#39;s Sugar for decoration Instructions: Cream butter and add sugar. Add 1/2 cup of flour mixing after each addition. Add remaining ingredients. Shape into a disk and then chill for 30 minutes. You can also put the dough in the freezer at this point. Begin to roll the dough the dough so that it is about 1/4-inch thick or a little more. Cut with cookie cutters. Place dough on parchment paper or a greased cookie sheet. I prefer using parchment paper. It&#39;s just easier. Preheat oven to 350 degree F. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes or until the edges are a bit brown. You may need to lower your oven to 325 degrees F. You can also freeze or chill the dough in a log shape rather than a disk. If you do this, simply cut small rounds about 1/4 inch thick and place these rounds on the lined cookie sheet. These bake for 15 minutes. (This works well, if you want to transport dough to a friend&#39;s house and have kids form the cookies.) Once the cookies come out of the oven, either cool them on the cookie sheet or move the parchment paper to a cookie rack. As the cookies cool, but before they&#39;re fully cooled, sprinkle with confectioner&#39;s sugar. Arrange on a plate and don&#39;t blink because they&#39;ll disappear before you open your eyes. Eat.

Set aside until the yeast activates and becomes foamy on top, about 10 minutes.<br> Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan until the butter melts. Allow to cool to less than 115 degrees F.<br> Whisk the flour, salt and remaining sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the foamy yeast mixture and cooled milk mixture. Turn on the mixer to knead the dough for about 5 minutes. The dough should be a smooth uniform ball that no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm area until the dough doubles in size, about 1 1/2 hours.<br> For the filling: In the meantime, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Brown the beef, stirring and breaking it up into small pieces, about 5 minutes. Once browned, transfer to a bowl and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium, add the cabbage, onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 15 minutes. Add the browned beef back to the skillet, stir it together with the cabbage and onions for 5 minutes. Add the white pepper and additional salt if needed. Take off the heat and set aside to cool completely.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.<br> When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and divide it into 10 equal-size balls, about 3 1/2 ounces each. Roll a ball into a rectangle, roughly 6- by 8- inches. Spread 1/2 cup of the cooled filling in the center of the rectangle. Bring the two long sides of dough together so the seam is facing up and pinch them together. Pinch the short ends shut as well. You should have a rectangular shape. Put the filled dough seam-side down on one of the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining 9 balls and the filling. There should be 5 pies per baking sheet. Cover the meat pies with a dish towel and allow them to rest for about 20 minutes. Bake in the oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.<br> While the pies bake, melt the butter. As soon as the meat pies come out of the oven, brush the tops with the melted butter and serve with ketchup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7309,&quot;Ayran Yogurt Shake 1 pint yogurt 1 1/2 cups cold water 1/2 cup heavy cream Salt to taste Crushed ice Fresh mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: Place the yogurt, water, cream and salt in a blender and blend for about 1 minute, or until frothy.

In the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook (or large mixing bowl) attachment add the warm water, yeast and pinch of sugar. Stir and set aside until the yeast has dissolved, about 10 minutes. To the bowl add the 1/4 cup of sugar, salt, egg, and the evaporated milk. With the mixer on low, add half the flour and mix until just combined. Add the shortening, and then gradually add the remaining flour until the dough forms into a mass. Turn off the mixer and transfer to floured surface. Add more flour, if needed, until you have an even, medium-textured (it should be pretty firm) dough. Add the dough to a large buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for at least 3 to 4 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator. Once rested, gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle a little more flour on top so you can work with the dough. Gently shape the dough into a 1-inch thick rectangle so it can be cut into squares. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter cut into squares, (you should yield 12 large squares, depending on how thick you rolled the dough). Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Heat about 3 inches of oil in a large, heavy-based pot over medium heat, (you want to make sure there is plenty of room as the beignets will puff up when cooked) to 350 degrees F.

Reduce the heat so the broth simmers gently. Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook until slightly crispy, about 3 minutes. Add shallots and cook stirring, until tender, about 1 minute. Add the rice and stir until it is glossy, about 1 minute. Add the salt. Add 1 cup of the Barolo and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it is absorbed by the rice, about 2 minutes, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the simmering broth and stir constantly, until the rice again absorbs the liquid, adjusting the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Continue ladling in about 1/2 cup of broth at a time, stirring between additions and letting the rice absorb the liquid before adding more. When rice is al dente, after 20 or so minutes of cooking time, stop adding broth. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup wine until just absorbed, then stir in the grated Parmesan and the butter. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Let the risotto rest off the heat for a minute or so before serving. Divide among warm shallow bowls and top with the roasted vegetables. Shave black truffles over the top, or drizzle with a bit of truffle oil, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Pinot Noir, Grenache]</p><p>&quot; 7352,&quot;Grilled Portobello Salad with Hazelnut Pesto 1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves<br> 1/3 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 4 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed<br> 1/2 cup olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br> 4 ounces baby arugula<br> 1 small head fennel, bulb thinly sliced, fronds reserved for garnish<br> Instructions: For the hazelnut pesto: Place the parsley, hazelnuts, Parmesan and garlic in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped.

Bake until the pies are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 7402,&quot;Herb Frittata 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more if needed 2 tablespoons minced chives or onions 1 1/2 cups fresh herbs and greens, all carefully cleaned and dried, then torn into small pieces 12 large eggs 6 tablespoons whole or low-fat milk 1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons grated aged or semi-aged montasio cheese Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Thoroughly butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch nonstick skillet. If 2 tablespoons are not sufficient, use more butter. Place the pan over low heat; when the butter becomes warm, add chives or onions. Heat gently, just until they give off a little fragrance. Add the herbs and greens and, if necessary, a little more butter. Stir so that all the flavors mingle. While the greens are heating, beat the eggs, milk, flour, cheese and a little pepper into a large bowl. Add the egg mixture to the greens and stir with a fork, taking care to avoid scraping the fork along the bottom of the pan. While working with the fork in 1 hand, shake the pan continuously to prevent the frittata from sticking. Once the frittata has a rather firm skin on the bottom, slide it out of the pan and onto a plate. Invert the frittata back into the pan so that the less-cooked side of the frittata is now face-down in the pan. Return to the heat and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, shaking the pan continuously to prevent sticking. The frittata is done when the bottom is firm and light chestnut-brown. Slide the frittata onto a dish for serving. If you plan to cool the frittata, cover it with a clean cloth or paper towels. Cut into wedges before serving. Variations: To make a baked omelet, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Prepare the greens as above and transfer to a buttered 8-inch baking dish. Beat the eggs, milk, flour, cheese, and pepper in a large bowl and pour over the greens. Bake for 15 minutes, unmold onto a plate, cut into wedges, and serve. Although usually served plain, you can drape a paper-thin slice of prosciutto di San Daniele over the frittata before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 7403,&quot;Veggie-Packed Autumn Minestrone 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, removed from casings and crumbled<br> 4 ribs celery, diced 3 medium carrots, diced<br> 1 medium yellow onion, diced 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 8 cups chicken stock<br> One 28-ounce can diced tomatoes<br> One 15.5-ounce can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 2 cups diced peeled sweet potatoes 2 zucchini, cut into 1-inch wedges<br> 3 to 4 cups baby spinach<br> Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving 1 lemon, cut into wedges<br> Instructions: In a large stockpot, heat the oil over medium heat.

Lightly dust work surface with cornmeal. With a bench scraper divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Lightly round the halves and let rest on surface for 15 minutes. Shape the rested dough halves into French loaves and let rest for 5 minutes. Roll each loaf into a long rope. Twist each rope into a braid. Spray the tops with water and dip the tops in sesame seeds. Transfer the shaped loaves onto the back of 2 cookie sheets lined with parchment paper, cover lightly plastic wrap. Place the loaves in a warm place and let rise for 45 to 60 minutes. Working with 1 loaf a time, slide the scali, still on the parchment paper, onto the baking stone and and bake until crispy and brown, about 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer the scali to a rack to cool. Repeat with the remaining loaf. Pate Fermentee just means \\old dough. \\Old dough?, you say. Well, this old dough is basically a starter that is made the day before, and cuts down on the time you eventually spend in the kitchen. Nothing wrong with that. It also makes the bread last longer, gives it a slightly acidic and subtly complex flavor, and helps the inside of the bread form tiny irregular holes that are a sign of great artisanal bread (called \\crumb\\ in baker-speak).<br> If you can, try weighing out the ingredients, instead of using measuring cups and spoons; it&#39;s much more accurate.<br> Use this dough to make Scali, an Italian sesame seed-crusted bread, or Gorgonzola and Walnut Fougasse; or both. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pate fermentee and water and, using your hands, break up the dough into the water. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the pate fermentee mixture and mix by hand until firm and cohesive, about 3 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough until very elastic and smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 78 degrees F. Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap (the plastic should not touch the dough). Place the bowl in a warm place (about 75 to 78 degrees F.) and let rise for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes, fold the dough and turn it over in the bowl. (It will somewhat deflate the dough, but it is gentler than what&#39;s commonly referred to as \\punching down.) Let the dough rise, undisturbed, for 1 hour more. (The dough will rise considerably at this point.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough gently into a rectangle, to de-gas it. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and, using your hands, mix until incorporated, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, mix in a mixer on the lowest setting possible.) Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm place (about 75 degrees F.). Let the dough ferment for 1 hour. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 75 degrees F.<br> Refrigerate the dough at least 10 hours and up to 36 hours. When ready, it will be roughly doubled in size and have a fine network of filaments and holes. Make this recipe the night before you mix the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 7419,&quot;Coffee Macaroons 3/4 cup blanched almonds 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 tablespoon freeze-dried coffee, dissolved in 1 teaspoon boiling water 1 cup chocolate Ganache, at room temperature 2 1/4 ounces bittersweet chocolate 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon heavy cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, combine the almonds and brown sugar. Process until completely ground. Using an electric mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar on low speed until frothy. Add 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue whipping until very stiff peaks and the whites just begin to slip and streak around the side of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the mixture and fold in the almond and sugar mixture. When almost completely incorporated, add the 2 teaspoons of coffee and continue folding until mixed. The batter must be smooth an shiny, and it should spread easily without being runny. If it is dull and firm, fold it a little longer to deflate it slightly and get the required consistency. But do not deflate it too much or the batter with spread too much and the tops of the cookies will crack when baked. Fill a large pastry bag, fitted with a 3/4 inch plain pastry tube, with the batter. Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper. Pipe the domes in staggering rows 1 inch wide and 1 inch apart. Unless you have 2 ovens, pipe only 1 sheet of cookies at a time. Bake for 1 minute. Place an empty baking sheet underneath the sheet of cookies, and continue baking, using a wooden spatula to hold the oven door ajar, until the tops of the cookies are very lightly browned and dry to the touch white the insides are still soft and the bottoms still pale, about 8 to 10 minutes. Lift the baking sheet of cookies off the empty baking sheet and take it to the sink. Pour cold water, about 1/2 cup, between the paper and the baking sheet (tilting the baking sheet so that the water runs over the entire surface and drains thoroughly into the sink) to steam the cookies off the paper. Then place the baking sheet on a wire rack and cool. Spread the bottoms of half the cookies with some of the Ganache. Place the remaining cookies, right side up, on top of the Ganache, pressing slightly to form a sandwich. Place the filled macaroons on a serving plate. Chop the chocolate and put it in a small stainless steel bowl. Bring the cream just to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly with a wire whisk. Gradually stir the cream into the chocolate with the whisk and continue stirring until the chocolate is completely melted. Then, allow it to cool, stirring occasionally with a wooden spatula, until it starts to thicken. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 7420,&quot;Omelette with Avocado, Bacon and Monterey Jack 4 eggs 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon, plus more for garnish<br> 1 teaspoon sea salt<br> 1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 3 thick slices peppered bacon, cooked until crisp<br> 1/2 ripe avocado, sliced<br> 3 slices Monterey Jack<br> Fresh chervil leaves, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

(Cook&#39;s note: This is to heat the eggs through so they set like a custard. Keep swirling them around so the eggs aren&#39;t in one spot long enough to burn.) Once the eggs begin to set, stop stirring. Transfer the pan to the oven for 1 1/2 minutes; the omelette should still have a soft custard touch Top the omelette with the bacon, avocado and Monterey Jack. Return it to the oven for 30 seconds, just so the cheese begins to melt. Using an oven mitt to grip the handle, tip the pan sideways and roll the omelette onto a plate with the help of a spatula. Garnish with more chives and tarragon, and chervil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 7421,&quot;Chicken-Fried Fish 12 ounces green beans, trimmed Kosher salt 4 6-ounce tilapia fillets Freshly ground pepper 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon paprika, plus more for sprinkling 2 large eggs 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons cream cheese 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Place the green beans in a microwave-safe dish.

Make the marinade: Combine 2 tablespoons mustard, the white wine, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and the thyme in a bowl. Pour over the lamb, then cover the lamb with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to marinate for a few hours or overnight, turning the lamb from time to time. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the lamb from the marinade and place fatty-side up in a roasting pan fitted with a rack (reserve the marinade). Season on all sides with salt and pepper and rub with the olive oil. The bone should be elevated off the bottom of the pan; this will allow for more even roasting. Place the roasting pan in the center of the oven and roast 25 to 30 minutes. Reducethe oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140 degrees F, 50 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes more. (I usually count between 12 to 14 minutes total roasting time per pound of meat, including the weight of the bone.) Remove from the oven and let the roast rest fat-side down on a cutting board to help redistribute the juices, about 30 minutes. Save the pan drippings. Meanwhile, make the gravy: Scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the roasting pan; transfer the drippings to a small saucepan. Add the reserved marinade, the sherry and the remaining 1 tablespoon mustard and bring to a boil; cook over medium-low heat, whisking, until thick, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a gravy boat. Slice the lamb against the grain and serve with the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 7429,&quot;Tilapia Fish and Chips 4 russet potatoes, washed 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons malt vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Canola oil, for frying 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon paprika 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus 1/2 cup for dredging Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup buttermilk 3/4 cup club soda 4 tilapia fillets about 1 1/2 pounds, cut in half lengthwise Tartar sauce, for serving Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Slice the potatoes into 1/2-inch thick wedges. Place in large bowl with olive oil, vinegar salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. Toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes until potatoes are crisp and tender on the inside. In a large pot or fryer heat canola oil to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl combine baking powder, cayenne, paprika, and 2 cups flour. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk in buttermilk and club soda. Dredge the tilapia in the remaining 1/2 cup flour then dip into batter. Carefully drop into the hot oil. Fry in batches for 5 minutes until golden brown and remove to a plate lined with paper towels. Serve with fries and a side of tartar sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7430,&quot;Candy Cane Roll 4 large eggs, separated 1/2 cup plus 1/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoons red food coloring<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2/3 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 cup cocoa powder<br> 2 tablespoons powdered sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/8 teaspoon baking soda<br> 2 cups cream cheese 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 2 sheets gelatin, melted according to package instructions<br> 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract<br> 1 cup powdered sugar, sifted 1/2 cup candy cane pieces<br> Powdered sugar, for dusting White Chocolate and Peppermint Cream, recipe follows Candy canes, for garnish 1 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup white chocolate chips 1 teaspoon peppermint extract Instructions: For the red velvet cake: Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the egg whites in a bowl with 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and whisk using an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form, 8 to 10 minutes. In a separate bowl, mix the egg yolks and remaining 1/3 cup granulated sugar. Add the food coloring, vanilla and 3 tablespoons water and mix. Combine the egg white mixture with the egg yolk mixture. To a separate bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, baking powder and baking soda and mix. Sift the flour mixture onto the egg mixture, folding it in gently; avoid overmixing it. Fold until all the ingredients are just combined. Spread the mixture onto the prepared half sheet pan, making it as level and even as possible. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Once out of the oven, roll the cake with the aid of the parchment paper while it is still warm. Otherwise, it will break when it is cold. Store it in the refrigerator rolled until you are ready to frost and roll it again. For the filling: Add the cream cheese, heavy cream, melted gelatin and peppermint extract to the bowl of a stand mixer and beat until soft peaks. Add the powdered sugar and candy cane pieces. Whip again to stiff peak stage. For a more stable filling, the mixture can be refrigerated for 24 hours; however, it can also be used right away. Unroll the red velvet cake roll, keeping it on the parchment paper, and spread the filling on as evenly as possible. Roll it up, using the parchment paper to help you again. Freeze for 1 hour. For the decorations: Cut the roll in half and trim the ends of both pieces so they are neat. Dust with powdered sugar, then decorate with the White Chocolate and Peppermint Cream and top with candy canes. Add two-thirds of the cream to a small saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Heat until it begins to steam but does not boil, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the white chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl and pour the hot cream on top. Allow to stand for a couple of minutes, then stir until smooth. Add the remaining cream and the peppermint extract and whisk to combine. Cover the mixture and place in the refrigerator to cool completely and for the flavors to infuse, about 2 hours. Whisk with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a piping bag and use to decorate the candy cane rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7431,&quot;White Pizza with Indian Spiced Greens 1 to 2 tablespoons canola oil 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 large bunch greens, coarsely chopped (Swiss chard, spinach, or any combination - I used Swiss chard and removed the stems) 1 bunch fresh mustard greens, coarsely chopped 1 to 2 teaspoons hot curry powder (can use more, depends on how spicy you like it) Homemade pizza dough or 1 (16-ounce) store-bought dough Olive oil, for grill 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, shredded 3/4 cup shredded fontina cheese 1/2 cup goat cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup crumbled paneer Instructions: Preheat the grill to 400 degrees F. Heat the pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Saute the garlic for 1 minute. Add in the greens and saute until wilted. Add in the curry powder and continue to cook the greens until they start to get soft. Remove from heat and set aside. Cut the dough into 2 (8-ounce) pieces. Stretch the dough out on a lightly floured surface with your hands. When the grill is at a consistent 400 to 450 degrees F (no hotter than 450), lightly brush the grill with olive oil. Place dough directly onto the grill surface. Close the grill cover and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. About 2 minutes in, open the grill and pop the air bubbles with a fork. The bottom should be brown with some charred spots but not burned or underdone. Close lid and continue cooking. Remove from grill and place on a work surface with the cooked/grilled side up. Lower the heat on the grill to medium-low heat so that the cheese has time to melt and the bottom does not burn. Spread equal amounts of the mozzarella and fontina on each pizza. Divide the cooked greens on top of the cheese. Place a few dollops of crumbled goat cheese over the top of the greens, then sprinkle with the crumbled paneer. Lightly oil grill once more and carefully place pizzas, cheese side up, onto the grill. Close the lid and let it cook slowly for another 5 to 10 minutes to allow the cheese to melt and so that the bottom does not burn. When the cheese is completely melted and the bottom is a nice even brown with some charred spots, remove from the grill to a cutting board, slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 7432,&quot;Braised Oxtail Burger 2 pounds oxtail Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 carrot, rough cut 1 celery rib, rough cut 1/2 white onion, rough cut 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 sprigs fresh tarragon 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 2 cups chicken stock 2 cups red wine 1 cup veal demi-glace 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 yellow onion, sliced thin 1 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds ground mixed sirloin and brisket 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1/2 pound Comte or Gruyere, shredded 8 ounces arugula 1 teaspoon lemon juice 6 brioche buns, toasted Small bunch fresh chives, chopped Instructions: For the oxtail: Sprinkle the oxtail with salt and pepper on all sides. Sear the oxtail in the olive oil in a pressure cooker on the saute function until golden brown on all sides. Add the carrot, celery and onion and cook until starting to caramelize. Add the thyme, tarragon, rosemary, chicken stock, red wine and veal demi-glace. Close the pressure cooker according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions and pressure cook for 50 minutes. Release the steam according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions and remove the oxtail to a plate to cool, then remove the meat from the bones. Strain the liquid from the pressure cooker into a medium saucepan and reduce the sauce until slightly thickened. Add the butter and blend the sauce with an immersion blender until it looks glossy. Taste and adjust the seasoning. For the aioli mayonnaise: Mix the mayonnaise, vinegar and garlic together in a small bowl. Set aside. For the caramelized onions: Warm a large saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, add the onions followed by the sugar, salt and pepper. Reduce the heat and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until all of the onion is caramelized, 15 to 30 minutes. For the burger: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, tarragon and salt in a large bowl. Reserve 1/2 cup oxtail for garnishing the burgers, then add the rest of the oxtail to the bowl. Mix well, but don&#39;t overmix. Form six 1/4-pound burger patties. Sprinkle both sides of each patty generously with salt and pepper. Set a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add the canola oil. When the oil shimmers, add the patties (you may need to do this in batches). Cook the patties all the way through, about 4 minutes, then flip and cook another 2 minutes. Add the butter, thyme sprigs and garlic to the skillet and let the butter get foamy, about 30 seconds, then baste the patties, about 1 minute. Flip the patties and baste the other side, 1 minute more. Remove the skillet from the heat and top each patty with some cheese. Place the skillet in the oven to melt the cheese, around 2 minutes. In the meantime, season the arugula with lemon juice, salt and pepper in a bowl. Spread a bottom bun with aioli mayonnaise and top with a heaping spoonful of the caramelized onions, some chopped chives, a patty, some reserved oxtail and a spoonful of oxtail gravy. Finish with a handful of dressed arugula and add the top bun. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 5 more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 7433,&quot;Glazed Bacon-Wrapped Crackers 1 sleeve (about 32) oval buttery crackers 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 1 pound thinly sliced bacon, each strip halved crosswise 2 tablespoons red currant or red pepper jelly Cayenne pepper, for sprinkling, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the crackers face up on a clean work surface and scoop 1/2 teaspoon Parmesan on each. Wrap each cracker with a piece of the bacon so the seam side is on the bottom and the cracker and cheese are covered as much as possible. Place the crackers seam-side down on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Bake until the bacon is golden and crisp, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk together the jelly with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and microwave on high until warmed through and loose, about 30 seconds; add more water if necessary. When the crackers are done, brush each with the jelly, sprinkle with the cayenne if using and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 7434,&quot;Roasted Pork Loin with Brussels Sprouts, Shallots and Garlic 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup grainy mustard Zest and juice of 2 lemons 1/2 cup white wine 8 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 pork loin, preferably center cut or relatively \\even\\ in thickness from one side of it to the other Kosher salt 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 12 cloves garlic, separated but not peeled 2 cups Brussels sprouts, washed and trimmed of any outer leaves 14 to 20 small shallots, peeled 1 teaspoon chili flakes 1/3 cup coarse breadcrumbs 1 tablespoon Sherry vinegar Instructions: For the marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk together the Dijon mustard, grainy mustard, the zest and juice from one of the lemons, white wine, fresh thyme, and the butter. Put the pork loin directly into the mixture, smoothing it on the meat like a paste. Refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When the oil begins to smoke, remove the skillet from the direct heat. Remove the pork loin from the bowl, leaving behind any excess mustard mixture. Reserve the mustard mixture. Season the meat on all sides with salt and gingerly place the pork loin in the hot oil. Put the skillet back on the heat and brown the pork, without moving it around, for 3 minutes. Use a pair of kitchen tongs (or two large spoons) to gently (but firmly) rotate the pork a 1/4 turn in the oil. Repeat this process turning the pork every 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, toss the garlic cloves, Brussels sprouts, and shallots in a bowl with the remaining olive oil, and white wine. Season with salt and the chili flakes. Place the vegetables evenly in the bottom of the roasting pan. When the pork is browned on all sides, remove it from the skillet and place it on a rack in the roasting pan. Take care to disperse the vegetables so the heat in the oven can circulate around and under the pork as it cooks. Pour any remaining marinade over the pork. Finishing and serving the pork: Place the roasting pan in the center of the oven and cook for 35 to 45 minutes. Test the temperature in the center of the loin. If underdone, cook for 5 to 10 additional minutes and test again. Remove the pork from the pan and allow it to \\rest\\ for 10 minutes. Place the roasting pan on top of the stove. Put the heat on low and add the Sherry vinegar and the remaining lemon zest and juice. Stir to blend with the vegetables. Taste for seasoning, then sprinkle with the breadcrumbs. Place the pork in the center of a platter (sliced or whole) and spoon the vegetables and any cooking liquid over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 7435,&quot;Home Fries with Za&#39;atar, Red cl, Cilantro, Lime and Clove-Scented Ketchup 1 cup ketchup, such as Heinz 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 5 large russet potatoes, parboiled in salted water, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 2 teaspoons za&#39;atar<br> 1/2 teaspoon paprika<br> 1/4 teaspoon turmeric<br> Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 2 Fresno chiles, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 cup coarsely chopped mixed herbs (a combination of cilantro, dill and parsley)<br> Juice of 1 lime Instructions: For the clove-scented ketchup: Whisk together the ketchup and clove in a small bowl.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta in the boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes less than the package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold water, then set aside. Cut the tops off the peppers. Remove and discard the stems, then finely chop the pepper flesh from the tops and set aside. Scoop out the seeds and as much of the membrane as you can. Place the peppers upright in a baking dish just large enough to accommodate them. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion and diced pepper tops. Cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Italian sausage, crumbling it as you go, and stir until it is cooked and nicely browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the marinara sauce and black pepper, then remove the skillet from the heat. Fold in the ricotta, half of the shredded mozzarella and the reserved pasta. Stir until well combined. Divide the mixture among the prepared peppers. Top the peppers with the remaining mozzarella and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add 1/2 cup water to the bottom of the baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the peppers are soft and the cheese is bubbly, another 15 minutes. Serve garnished with fresh basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 7441,&quot;Salisbury Steak with Mushroom Gravy 1 pound lean ground beef 1 (10-ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, divided 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs 1 egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup frozen chopped onions 1 teaspoon steak seasoning (recommended: Montreal) 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 tablespoons butter, divided 1/4 cup cognac</p>",116)]))}const g=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
