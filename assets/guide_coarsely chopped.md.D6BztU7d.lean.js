In a non-corrosive saucepan, add the oyster liquor, 8 ounces of the heavy cream, the celery seed, bay leaves, parsley, lemon zest, and juice. Bring to a boil and let reduce by 1/8. Strain through a fine sieve and return the cream mixture to the saucepan. Add the finely diced celery and ham and bring to a boil. Add the black pepper and check for saltiness, as the ham will add a great deal of salt to the mixture. If it is too salty, (hams will vary in saltiness) add a little more cream. Keep warm. Drain the celery root, and, in another saucepan, add the celery root. Cover with fresh, salted water and bring to a boil. Cook until tender and drain. In a food processor, add the celery root, butter, and remaining cream, and puree. Preheat the broiler. Place a 1/2 teaspoon of the celery root puree into each of the oyster shells, top with an oyster, and spoon the celery ham cream over the oysters. Place the filled oysters on bed of sea salt on a sheet pan and broil in the oven for about 5 minutes or until browning and bubbly.

Meanwhile, combine the vegetable stock with the ginger, lemongrass and shallot trimmings in a sauce pot over medium heat (the scraps will infuse the stock with even more flavor). When the sauteed vegetables are ready, strain the stock into the pot, then add the fish sauce, hot pepper sauce, soy sauce, thyme, lime juice, balsamic vinegar and peppercorns to the pot. Bring the liquid to a very low simmer, and cook for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and whisk in the remaining olive oil. Remove the pot from the burner and set aside until cool. You may store the vinaigrette in an airtight container for up to 1 week in the refrigerator. Skate: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Slice the tops and bottoms from the turnips and peel away the outer skin. Using the julienne blade on a mandolin (or a very sharp knife), julienne the turnip, slicing it into very thin, match-stick size pieces. Set aside. Spread the almonds on a non-stick sheet pan, and toast in the middle of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until you can just begin to smell them toasting. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the almonds to a plate or bowl. Set aside. Place a large, non-stick saute pan over medium-high heat. As it warms, brush the skate on 1 side with the softened butter. Season with salt and pepper, and add the skate to the hot pan, buttered-side down. Season again with salt and pepper. Let the skate sear without moving it, so the fish forms a crispy brown crust. When well browned, turn the skate and brown on the other side. While the skate is searing, warm another medium-sized saute pan over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, swirl to coat the bottom, and add the turnips and snow peas to the pan. Season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing frequently so that the vegetables cook evenly until crisp-tender. After 30 seconds, add the snow pea shoots. Toss, add the almonds, and remove from heat and mound in the center of 4 warm dinner plates. Top each with 1 piece of skate. Mix the vinaigrette well and ladle over the top of the fish, scattering the dressing and seasonings over the flesh. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 59343,&quot;Sunday Gravy and Macaroni (Spaghetti, really) 1 pound spaghetti 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, for both meats and sauce 3 thin cut pork loin chops, 1/2-inch thick, cut in 1/2 Salt and pepper 2 each sweet and hot Italian sausage links 1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, for moderate to spicy marinara 5 cloves garlic, chopped, 3 for sauce, 2 for meatballs 1 small onion, minced 1 cup beef broth 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls of leaves Several leaves fresh basil, torn or chopped, a handful 1 pound meat loaf mix, ground beef, pork and veal combined, from butcher counter 1 egg 1/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, 2 handfuls, plus extra for tossing pasta and to pass at table 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs, 3 handfuls 1 loaf crusty Italian bread, for serving Instructions: Heat water for pasta to boil.

Cover with water and boil until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside. Remove the giblets from the pan, allow them to cool, and then chop up the gizzards and liver. Pick the meat from the neck. Discard the bones. Pour all the turkey drippings out of the roasting pan into a separate container. Allow grease to separate from the juices. Ladle out the fat into another bowl. Place the roasting pan over 2 burners over medium heat (there should be lots of yummy brown bits in the pan). Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of the fat back into the pan. Whisk it around to evenly distribute it throughout the pan. Sprinkle 5 to 6 tablespoons of flour over the grease and whisk to combine it with the fat, loosening the bits from the bottom of the pan a little in the process. Cook the roux until it becomes a deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, whisking constantly. Add 2 to 4 cups, depending on your need. Cook the gravy, whisking gently, until the mixture begins to thicken. Pour in a little bit of the turkey drippings, but be aware that because the brine is so salty, these drippings are very salty. Keep cooking the gravy until thick, adding in chopped giblets, to taste, as well as plenty of black pepper. Use the giblet water from the saucepan to thin the gravy if it gets too thick.

Meanwhile, combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk in the remaining 1 cup milk a little at a time, to avoid lumps, then whisk in the egg. When the milk is boiling, remove the saucepan from the heat and gradually whisk in the sugar-milk mixture, stirring constantly. Return to medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the pudding comes to a simmer and is thick and creamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla until smooth. Divide the pudding among 4 to 6 1/2-cup ramekins or serving glasses, layering each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the lemon curd and topping with some of the lemon curd as well.

Check if there is enough moisture by squeezing some sugar paste in your hand; if it maintains its shape, it&#39;s ready to mold. If it falls apart, add more water until you reach the desired consistency. Continue to stir the sugar mixture as you mold the skull, to keep the moisture evenly distributed. Press the sugar paste into the front skull mold. Scrape off and clean the back of the mold with a bench scraper, then unmold the skull onto a piece of cardboard. Repeat with the back skull mold. Let the skull halves dry 8 hours or overnight. For the icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3/4 cup water in a large bowl. Mix slowly with an electric mixer until it forms stiff peaks; the icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. Apply a thin layer of icing to the flat side of one of the skull halves, then use it to \\glue\\ the two halves together. Let sit until dry, about 1 hour. Add food coloring to the icing (divide into several colors, if desired) and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. Transfer icings to small piping bags fitted with decorating tips and decorate the skulls as desired. Let sit until dry, 3 to 4 hours.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 59466,&quot;Black Chocolate Cake 1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pans 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans 1 cup unsweetened black cocoa powder 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 tablespoon instant coffee granules 1 1/2 cups boiling water 3/4 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 large eggs 2 cups sugar 3 large eggs 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup unsweetened black cocoa powder 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350?. Brush the bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans with vegetable oil and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda and baking powder in a medium bowl. In a separate medium bowl, combine the chopped chocolate and instant coffee; pour in the boiling water and let stand 5 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Combine the sour cream, vegetable oil and vanilla in a liquid measuring cup (it will look curdled). Beat the eggs and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly add the coffee-chocolate mixture; beat until combined. Beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the sour cream mixture in two batches, until just incorporated. (Keep the mixer on low as you add the ingredients, then increase the speed to medium briefly between additions to beat out the lumps.) The batter should look like hot fudge. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes in the pans, then run a knife around the edges and remove the cakes to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Whisk the eggs, 1/4 cup milk, the sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl until smooth (the mixture will be thick). Heat the remaining 1 1/4 cups milk in a saucepan over medium heat until just steaming. Gradually whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture, then pour the entire mixture into the pan. Bring to a boil, whisking (the mixture will become thick like pudding very quickly). Continue cooking 30 to 60 more seconds to thicken further, whisking vigorously, then remove from the heat. Pour into a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface. Refrigerate until cold, 3 to 4 hours. Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals until melted; let cool slightly. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir the cocoa pudding mixture to loosen, then gradually beat into the butter mixture, beating well after each addition. Beat in the melted chocolate. Continue beating, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Trim off the domed tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife. Put one cake layer on a platter. Spread 1 cup frosting on top, then top with the other cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.

The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using an electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options: If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse. This may take 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of the room and the strength of the yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It&#39;s best if you have already weighted or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much. If you&#39;re not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 degrees to 90 degrees F) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours) But don&#39;t let it collapse too much before you use it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59483,&quot;Crispy Eggplant and Portobello Mushroom and Cheese Sandwiches Vegetable oil cooking spray 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 large eggs, beaten, at room temperature<br> 2 cups panko breadcrumbs<br> Four 1/2-inch-thick eggplant slices (1/2 a medium eggplant)<br> Four 4-inch diameter portobello mushrooms, stemmed<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling, optional<br> Four 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick slices country wheat bread, toasted or grilled<br> 3/4 cup jarred tomato-basil sauce, such as Giada De Laurentiis for Target<br> 8 ounces gruyere cheese, shredded<br> 2 cups arugula<br> Instructions: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Sift both flours together on a large work surface and make a well in the center. Place the eggs, olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then pour into the well; with a fork, break up the eggs, then gradually mix the wet ingredients into the flour mixture just until combined. Knead by hand. Gather the dough into 2 equal-size balls; flour the surface. To knead each piece, push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand, fold the dough over itself and turn it counterclockwise. Continue pushing, folding and turning until the dough is smooth and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes. Rest the dough. Pat each piece into a ball. Flatten slightly, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight. (You can freeze 1 ball for later, or roll out both and freeze the cut pasta.) Roll out the dough. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and dust with flour. Starting in the middle, push away from you with a rolling pin, easing up on the pressure as you approach the edge. Continue rolling the dough into a sheet, turning occasionally, until you can see your fingers through the bottom. Let dry about 10 minutes. Cut the pappardelle. Dust the top of the sheet of dough with flour and loosely roll it into a cylinder. Using a sharp knife, cut into 3/4-inch-wide slices. Unwrap the noodles; dust with semolina and gently toss to separate. Place on a sheet pan and cover with a tea towel until ready to cook (or freeze in freezer bags for up to 2 months). &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 59486,&quot;Abalone Victoria 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley 1 cup bread crumbs 1 egg yolk 2 teaspoons clarified butter 1 teaspoon lemon juice Flour, to coat 8 sliced abalone steaks Salt, to taste White pepper, to taste 1/2 cup butter 1 tablespoon sherry Instructions: Mix together parsley and bread crumbs.

Mix with your hands until it feels like you could make a ball that would just slightly hold together and everything is crumbly. Take a tiny bite; it should be slightly sweet with a hint of salt (like a good chocolate chip cookie!). Add a tiny pinch more of salt as needed. Cover the bowl and place in the freezer while finishing the recipe. Remove from the freezer 5 minutes before using and break apart with a fork as if you were flaking rice. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Poke the sweet potatoes about 6 to 8 times, about 1/4-inch deep, using a fork. Rub with the oil and set the potatoes on a baking sheet. Roast on the middle rack until fork tender and the skins are darkened, 40 to 50 minutes. Set aside to cool. By the time the potatoes are cool enough to handle, the skins will loosen from the flesh. With your hands, gently remove the skins and discard. Place the sweet potato flesh in a large bowl along with the cream, flour, brown sugar, butter and pumpkin pie spice. Mash until smooth. Shift the oven rack one level down and turn on the broiler. Spread out the marshmallows in a single layer on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and broil, watching the entire time. When the tops of the marshmallows char to a black color and begin smoking (be strong, brown looks good, but black tastes better!), quickly remove from the oven. Lower the oven to 375 degrees F. With a rubber spatula, fold the marshmallows into the mashed sweet potatoes until combined. Taste and add a bit more brown sugar if needed, a tablespoon at a time; this should be just on the edge of sweet, the topping does the rest. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and fold them into the sweet potatoes to combine. Spread the sweet potato mixture into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, leveling the top. Sprinkle the prepared topping evenly over the potatoes. Bake until the topping is shiny and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59492,&quot;Powdermilk Biscuits Unsalted butter, for the pan 1 3/4 cups bread flour 1 3/4 cups cake flour, plus more for dusting 2 1/2 tablespoons baking powder 1/4 cup sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening 2 large eggs, plus 1 beaten egg for brushing 1 cup buttermilk or milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Unroll 1 pie dough into a round. Arrange three 4 1/4-inch nonstick tartlet pans on the dough and use a paring knife to cut a circle of dough around each that is about 1/2 inch larger than the pan; these don&#39;t have to be perfect, but you want to make sure you cut enough excess dough to fill the pan and up the sides. Press the dough evenly into each pan; if any excess dough goes over the top, simply use the top edge of the tartlet pan to cut it away. Use a fork to dock the bottom of the pie crusts. Repeat this process with 3 more tartlet pans and the remaining pie dough. Place the 6 tartlet pans on a baking sheet and put in the freezer for 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, toss together the cherry tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper. Let the tomatoes sit for 10 to 15 minutes for the flavors to combine. Bake the crusts until the dough is cooked part of the way through without any color and bubbles form on the bottom and sides, about 6 minutes. Let cool slightly. To each tartlet, add about 3 tablespoons of grated Cheddar and spread evenly over the bottom. Top the cheese in each with 8 tomato halves cut-side up, making sure to get some garlic with each tomato. Bake until the crusts are golden brown, the cheese is bubbling and the tomatoes are softened but have not burst, about 30 minutes. Let cool until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes.

Cut up the butter and place the sifted sugars, butter, yolks, rum, and vanilla powder in the well. Work the well together. Work in the flour then \\fraisage\\ the dough, pushing it away from you on the counter with the heel of your hand. This helps schmear the butter into thin layers to make the cake flakey in the end. Chill the dough 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 360 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch cake pan and line the bottom with parchment and butter the paper. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to an 8-inch disk about 1/2-inch thick. Flip it over onto your hand and brush off the excess flour then place it in the pan. Brush the top with egg wash; then egg wash it again to get a thicker coating. Using a knife, decorate it with the traditional cross-hatching, or for restaurant presentation you carve a map of Brittany on the surface and do some angled lines all around the edge. Bake until golden brown, about 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan and serve in wedges. I kept this recipe in the original metric measurements I was taught it in to show the relationship between the ingredients. Quatre-Quarts (meaning \\four quarters) is a French cake shaped like a rectangle and all the ingredients (butter, sugar, flour, and eggs-oooo that would make a good book title, don&#39;t you think?) are of equal weights. My teacher, Chef Claude at La Varenne said you weigh the eggs and then match that measurement with the other ingredients. If you look this up in the dictionary, Quarte-quarts translates to pound cake, the American version of a pound of 4 equal ingredients, but with air whipped in for leavening. This cake is dense and buttery with a big crumb, more like a shortbread than a cake. You can do the mixing in a food processor but this recipe is the traditional way. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 59570,&quot;Carrot Bread With Hazelnuts, Coconut and Cream Cheese Glaze 1 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled (or 1/2 cup vegetable oil), plus more for the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg 3/4 cup hazelnuts, toasted and chopped 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 2 large eggs 1/2 cup plain yogurt or sour cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest (optional) 1 cup shredded carrots 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened 2 tablespoons milk 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Make the carrot bread: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out the dough to a 9-inch-diameter round. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Using your fingers, make indentations all over the dough. Brush the dough with butter, then bake until the crust is crisp and pale golden brown, about 20 minutes. Immediately spread the chocolate-hazelnut spread over the pizza then sprinkle all the chocolate chips over. Bake just until the chocolate begins to melt, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the hazelnuts over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve. Pizza Dough: Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend. Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend. Blend in the oil. With the machine running, add the yeast mixture and blend just until the dough forms. Turn the dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm draft-free area until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour. Punch the down dough and form into ball. The dough can be used immediately or stored airtight in the refrigerator for 1 day. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 59578,&quot;Candy Bar Clone 1/4 cup whole milk 5 unwrapped caramels 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 teaspoon butter 1/4 teaspoon vanilla 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar 20 unwrapped caramels 1 1/2 teaspoons water 2 cups dry roasted peanuts 1 (12-ounce) bag milk chocolate chips Instructions: Combine all the ingredients for the centers, except for the powdered sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often as the caramel slowly melts. When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and stir. Save the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often, then turn off the heat. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take 1 to 2 minutes. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don&#39;t let it sit too long-- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when you shape it. Take a teaspoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or on a countertop until it forms a roll with the width of your index finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on waxed paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center rolls sit out for 1 to 2 hours to firm up. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work fast this caramel will stay warm while you make the candy bars. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and working quickly, \\paint: a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn the center over, caramel side down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto waxed paper, and repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place the bars into your refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours so that they firm up. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the microwave for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds. Don&#39;t over-cook the chips or the chocolate will burn and seize up on you. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with chocolate using 2 forks, 1 in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate, balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off. Carefully place the candy bar onto waxed paper and remove the 2 forks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, and then chill the candy bars until firm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59579,&quot;Chicken Spedini 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup small-diced tomatoes 1/4 cup julienned red onions<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley 6 airline-style (with drumette attached) skin-on chicken breasts (about 8 ounces each) 1/4 cup thinly sliced strips red onions 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce<br> 4 cups cooked penne, kept warm 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/4 cup warm Parmesan Cream, recipe follows Olive oil, for drizzling Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish 3 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups milk 6 cups grated Parmesan Salt and white pepper Instructions: For the chicken and stuffing: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil on medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Then add the tomatoes and onions and stir. Cook this mixture until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and finish with minced parsley. Remove from the heat, stir and let cool. Drain off any excess liquid. Slice a pocket in each breast from the top area next to the drumette three-quarters into the breast towards the tip. Fill each pocket with about 2 tablespoons stuffing and pat flat to ensure even cooking. Warm an oven-safe nonstick pan over medium-high heat with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil for 2 minutes. Sprinkle the breasts with salt and pepper. Add the breasts to the pan, skin-side first, and allow to sear until the skin is browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the second side for 2 minutes, and then place in the oven and finish for 8 to 10 minutes. Let the chicken rest until plating; keep the oil in the pan. For the pasta: Place the heated chicken pan again over medium heat and add the onions. Cook, stirring, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Finally, reduce the heat to low, add the tomato sauce and stir to warm for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the pasta, stir and warm. Saucing the pasta should take 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Parmesan and stir. Portion the pasta onto individual plates and top with a stuffed breast. Top with some Parmesan Cream and drizzle with olive oil. Garnish with parsley. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the butter and cook until melted. Reduce the heat to medium, add the flour and cook, stirring, to create a roux; cook until the roux is a pale blond color.

Add the milk, sour cream, egg yolk and 1/2 cup flour; beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until combined. Gradually beat in the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour, scraping the bowl as needed, to form a wet dough, about4 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high; add the whole egg, sugar, salt and vanilla and beat until creamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time; beat until incorporated. The dough will be very wet. Brush a large bowl with butter; transfer the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Stir the dough to punch it down; cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Generously dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour. Pat the dough into a square on the parchment, then roll into an 11-by-15-inch rectangle. Transfer the dough and parchment to a baking sheet and brush off the excess flour. Cover and chill until firm enough to shape, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the filling: Pulse the almonds and sugar in a food processor until fine. Add the butter, egg, rum, vanilla, cinnamon, orange zest and almond extract; pulse until smooth. Cover and chill 1 hour. Make the streusel: Mash the confectioners&#39; sugar, flour and butter in a bowl with a fork to make clumps. Cover and chill until ready to use. Butter an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Spread the almond filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border; sprinkle with the chocolate. Starting from a short side, use the parchment to tightly roll up the dough, brushing off the excess flour. Pinch the ends of the roll, then twist several times. Fold the twist in half so the ends meet. Twist the folded dough again and place in the pan. Cover with buttered parchment; let rise in a warm place until puffy, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the loaf with the beaten egg, then sprinkle with the streusel. Bake until the bread is golden and springs back when pressed, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. Loosen with a knife, then let cool in the pan, 1 hour. Unmold onto a rack to finish cooling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59591,&quot;Caramel Apple Cake Cooking spray 2 18.25-ounce boxes spice cake mix (plus required ingredients) 2 16-ounce tubs vanilla frosting 20 drops red food coloring 2 dashes vanilla extract 10 drops yellow food coloring 70 soft caramels (about 20 ounces) 1 cup cocktail peanuts, roughly chopped Instructions: Coat four 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and prepare the cake mixes as directed (or coat 2 pans and make the cakes in 2 batches). Divide the batter among the pans and bake as directed. Let cool 20 minutes, then remove from the pans and let cool completely. Stack the cakes on an upside-down cake pan, spreading frosting between the layers. Freeze 30 minutes. Using a small serrated knife, trim the bottom 2 layers of the cake on an angle to resemble the bottom of an apple. Trim the top layer just enough to round the edge, then carve out a 3-inch-wide cone-shaped piece of cake from the middle where the stem would be (about1 1/2 inches deep). Gather all of the cake trimmings in a bowl. Crumble the cake trimmings and mix with just enough frosting to moisten. Clump the mixture together and mound in a ring around the hole to form the top of the apple. Cover the cake with a thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat-it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect). Freeze 20 minutes. Remove from the freezer and completely cover the top 4 inches of the cake and inside the cavity with more frosting. Mix the red food coloring with a dash of vanilla. Use a pastry brush to paint the top few inches of the cake a streaky red, blotting the brush on paper towels as needed. Repeat with the yellow food coloring to add a few yellow streaks. Unwrap the caramels and microwave until soft but not melted, about 20 seconds. Gather together, then flatten into a rectangle with your hands. Roll out on parchment paper to make a 7-by-26-inch rectangle, stretching with your hands as needed. Lightly brush the caramel rectangle with water where you want the peanuts to go.

Juice one grapefruit into a liquid measure. On the second grapefruit, slice the bottom and top to level it, then starting at the top where the white pith ends and the pink flesh begins, cut between the 2 layers at an angle from the top to bottom all the way around to remove the skin and expose the flesh, making sure to slice off all the pithy white parts. Holding the grapefruit in one hand, release the wedges by using the knife to slice on either side of each segment. Place these wedges in a medium saute pan. Squeeze the remaining flesh and membranes of the grapefruit to release any juice into a bowl. Add the sugar and honey. Whisk to combine, then taste. If needed, add a teaspoon or more brown sugar to take away the tart of the grapefruit. Pour half of the mixture into a saute pan with the grapefruit wedges. Bring to a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced and slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. To the remaining half add the oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk to combine and pour into a plastic bag. Add the chicken, seal and toss a bit before resting on the counter for 25 to 30 minutes.

Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, work the butter and shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles small peas. Work the ice water into the mixture with your fingers just until the dough comes together; be careful not to overmix. Form the dough into 2 disks, and wrap each disk individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. Roll out and fit into pans and use for pies as desired. Makes 2 (9-inch) pie crusts For the pie: Roll 1 piece of the pastry out to a thickness of between 1/8 and 1/4-inch and fit into a deep-dish pie pan. Trim the overhang to about 1-inch, then fold pastry overhang inward along the top edge of the pie pan, press, and crimp the top edges decoratively (so that the crust is thicker along the top edge and stands up slightly above the top edge of the pie pan). Place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to several hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line the pie crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights. Place in the oven and bake until the top edges are lightly golden and the bottom of the crust is set and no longer looks doughy, usually about 20 minutes.

Remove meat from the refrigerator and unwrap. Let beef stand a few minutes, to take the chill off. Heat a medium skillet over moderate heat. Add butter and sliced onions to a hot pan and season with salt. Saute onions for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are caramel in color, tender, and sweet. Meanwhile, place peppercorns in a heavy-duty food storage bag. Hit peppercorns with a small, heavy frying pan to crack them. Baste meat with a little Worcestershire sauce on each side using a pastry brush. Coat steaks on 1 side with cracked black peppercorns. Grill steaks 5 minutes on each side for medium rare. Meanwhile, heat leftover mashed potatoes on high in microwave oven for 5 minutes. If you are using instant potatoes, prepare to package directions and transfer warm potatoes to a mixing bowl. Stir cheese and scallions into the mashed potatoes. Heat a nonstick skillet over moderate heat. Coat the inside of pan with butter to aid in crusting. Spread cheesy potatoes in an even layer in the skillet and allow them to crust and brown on the bottom, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut the potato layer in half gently with a butter knife, careful not to scratch your nonstick surface. Fold one half over top of the opposite making a half moon shaped potato pie with a crusty outside and a cheesy, soft center. While steaks and potatoes cook, brown chopped bacon in the small frying pan you used to crack the peppercorns over high heat. Transfer browned bacon bits to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Wipe out skillet and return to heat. Add 1 /2 cup balsamic vinegar to the pan and bring to a bubble. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1 to 2 minutes, until vinegar is reduced by half and thick. Turn off heat. Pour spinach into salad bowl. Top with bacon and mushrooms. Whisk extra-virgin olive oil into warm vinegar and pour over salad. Toss salad and serve. Season the cooked steaks with a little salt and remove to a carving board. Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes for the juices to redistribute through the meat evenly. If you slice into a hot steak, the juices will run out and the first bite will be the only tasty one. Slice steaks thin against the grain of the meat. Smother steak slices in onions. Cut potato pie into 4 wedges and serve along side steaks with spinach salad. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 59628,&quot;Butterflied Juniper-Brined Roasted Turkey with Chipotle-Maple Butter 2 cups kosher salt 1 1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons juniper berries 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 5 bay leaves Zest of 1 lemon One 14- to 16-pound turkey (not kosher or self-basting), butterflied 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup maple syrup 2 chipotle peppers in adobo, peppers only, reserving the sauce for another use 1 clove garlic Kosher salt Instructions: Combine the salt, brown sugar, juniper, peppercorns, bay leaves and lemon zest with 1 quart (4 cups) water in a small saucepan.

Brush an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet or jelly roll pan with coconut oil; line the bottom with parchment paper. Brush the parchment with more oil and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl; set aside. Place the eggs (in their shells) in a medium bowl and cover with hot tap water; let stand 5 minutes, then drain. Crack the eggs into a separate large bowl and add the granulated sugar. Beat with a mixer on medium-low speed, 30 seconds, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until thick, pale and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. (Don&#39;t underbeat; the beaten eggs are essential to help the cake rise.) Pour the egg mixture over the flour mixture and gently fold together with a rubber spatula until combined. Add the melted coconut oil and coconut extract and stir to just combine. Spread the batter in the prepared pan; bake until the cake springs back when gently pressed, about 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Generously sift confectioners&#39; sugar over the top of the warm cake and loosen the edges with a knife; lay a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) over the cake. Place another baking sheet over the towel and flip the cake with the baking sheets to invert it onto the towel. Remove the top baking sheet and parchment. Starting at a short end, roll up the cake and the towel together into a spiral. Transfer seam-side down to a rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees F, stirring once, until lightly browned and toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool.

Scatter the butter and shortening over the flour mixture. Pulse 4 to 5 times until the mixture resembles small pebbles with a few larger pieces. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of the ice water over top. Pulse until the mixture starts to clump and comes together, 6 to 8 times. If the mixture does not clump, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing 1 to 2 times between additions. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough to bring together in a ball. Divide the dough into 2 balls, wrap each tightly in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour.<br> For the dry rub and ribs: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Stir the cumin, chili powder, mustard, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.<br> Rinse and pat dry the ribs. Rub both sides of the ribs with the dry rub. Place each rack of ribs, fat-side up, on a sheet of aluminum foil and seal shut. Place the packets on a sheet pan and bake for 90 minutes. While the ribs are baking, make the sauce.<br> For the rib sauce: Put the olive oil in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. When it begins to shimmer, add the onions and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chipotle powder to the onions and stir until warmed and combined. Add the ketchup, molasses, brown sugar, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce to the pan. Stir to thoroughly combine. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the sauce is nicely thickened. Allow the sauce to cool slightly before using.<br> For the rib filling: When the ribs are done, make a slit in the top of each foil packet to allow steam to escape. Carefully open the packets (they will be hot!) and transfer the ribs to a wooden board. Using 2 forks, separate the meat from the bones and gently pull the meat apart. Place the shredded pork into a large bowl (discard the bones). You should have approximately 5 cups of shredded pork. Add the rib sauce, shredded potato and cheese to the bowl. Mix gently until the ingredients are combined.<br> To create the floorboard design for the pie top: Line a large work surface with parchment paper. Lightly flour the work surface and a rolling pin. Roll out one batch of chilled dough to a 12-inch circle. Turn a 9-inch pie plate upside down and, using a sharp knife, cut a circle of dough to match the circumference of your dish. Re-wrap any leftover pastry scraps and return to the refrigerator.<br> Use a ruler to mark horizontal lines 1 inch apart on the dough circle. Lay a lollipop stick down at these marks to make horizontal impressions in the dough. Next, mark vertical lines in a staggered brick style across the pastry. Bend the lollipop stick at the 1-inch mark and use the 1-inch piece to make impressions at these points. Use the end of the lollipop stick to make circular indentations at the top and bottom of both ends of each plank to form nail marks. Use a sharp knife or molding tool to create wavy freeform lines across the pie. Transfer the finished pie top on the parchment paper to the refrigerator to firm up for at least 15 minutes.<br> To assemble the pie: Lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin. Roll out the second batch of dough to a 12-inch circle. Gently roll the dough up around your rolling pin and transfer it to the pie plate. Unroll the pastry over the pie plate and fit gently into the pan.<br> Transfer the rib filling to the lined pie plate. Gently flatten the top of the filling so it even with the top of the pie plate. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Remove the patterned pie top from the refrigerator. Using a brush, dampen the edges of the pastry-lined pie plate. Gently slide a lifter or palette knife between the pie top and the parchment paper to separate. Tilt the parchment paper to slide the pie top into place on top of the pie. Press gently on all edges to seal.<br> To create the pie decorations: Print out the Father&#39;s Day Pie Stencil (link below) and cut out the letters with scissors (or use D and A letter cutters).

Transfer the brine to a 2-gallon sized re-sealable plastic bag. Add the chicken, close the bag and refrigerate 2 hours (if you&#39;ve only got 15 minutes, that&#39;s fine) to allow the salt and seasonings to penetrate the chicken. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Wrap the bacon around the bunch of thyme and tie with kitchen twine so you have a nice bundle. Heat about 2 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the thyme and cook slowly 3 to 4 minutes to render the bacon fat and give the sauce a nice smoky taste. Add the onion and garlic and cook slowly without coloring for 5 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, give the sauce a stir, and turn the heat down to low. Cook slowly for 20 minutes to meld the flavors. Once the sauce is done cooking, remove about 1 1/2 cups of the sauce and reserve for serving along side the chicken at the table. The rest of the barbecue sauce will be used for basing the legs. Preheat oven 375 degrees F. Preheat a grill pan or an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue to a medium heat. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel and carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill to make a nonstick surface. Take the chicken out of the brine, pat it dry on paper towels. Arrange the chicken pieces on the preheated grill and cook, turn once mid-way, and cook for a total of 10 minutes. Transfer the grill marked chicken to a cookie sheet and then place in the oven. Cook the chicken for 15 minutes, remove it from the oven and then brush liberally, coating every inch of the legs with the barbecue sauce and then return to the oven for 25 to 30 more minutes, basting the chicken for a second time half way through remaining cooking time. Serve with extra sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 59659,&quot;Ultimate Chili \\Cheese\\ Nachos 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 medium onions, finely chopped 1 red bell pepper, deseeded and finely chopped 1 1/2 cups canned kidney beans, drained and rinsed\\u202f(from a 15.5-ounce can) 1 cup plant-based ground meat alternative or plant protein burger, cooked and pulled apart with a fork 7 ounces green string beans, trimmed and chopped small 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon tamari sauce (gluten-free) or soy sauce 1 tablespoon tomato puree 1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce (standard has anchovies in it) 1 teaspoon chipotle cl paste (1/2 teaspoon if for kids) One 14.5-ounce can chopped tomatoes\\u202f Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, or 1 teaspoon dried cilantro\\u202f 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free all-purpose flour) 2 cups unsweetened plant-based milk (I use oat), or almond or soy for gluten-free 1/4 cup nutritional yeast flakes 2 teaspoons chipotle paste 1 teaspoon low-sodium vegetable bouillon powder 1 teaspoon ground turmeric One 13-ounce bag lightly salted corn tortilla chips 6 ounces sliced pickled jalapenos, drained (half a 12-ounce jar) Handful of chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).

Increase to high speed and beat until the eggs are lightened in color.<br> In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat on high until stiff peaks form. Set aside.<br> With the mixer running on medium speed, add the oil, milk, extract, zest, spice, salt and orange food color to the egg yolk mixture. Mix well until combined. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the flour and mix using a rubber spatula until just combined. Add a third of the beaten egg whites to the mixture and fold to combine. Add the remaining egg whites and gently fold to combine.\\u202f Sprinkle a tea towel with the confectioners\\u2019 sugar.\\u202f Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula to level. Bake until the sponge cake is springy and lightly brown around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Immediately turn the cake out onto the prepared tea towel. Roll up loosely and let cool completely.\\u202f<br> For the buttercream and decors: In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix together the butter and confectioners\\u2019 sugar. Begin on low speed until crumbly, and then increase to high and beat for 3 minutes until smooth and fluffy.<br> Add the vanilla extract and beat again for another minute. If you find the buttercream is too stiff, you may add milk or heavy cream 1 tablespoon at a time until the mixture is spreading consistency. Place about 2 cups of buttercream in a disposable piping bag.<br> Divide the remaining frosting into 4 bowls. Tint each bowl of frosting with each of the food colors: red, yellow, orange and green. Transfer the red, yellow and orange frostings each to a separate disposable piping bag with a 1/2-inch hole snipped in the end. Divide the green frosting between 2 piping bags: one fitted with a small leaf tip, and the other fitted with a 1/8-inch round tip.<br> Slice 2 large edges off of each piece of kiwi, avoiding the seeded white center as best you can. Remove the seeds and any of the white center from the pieces using a small paring knife. Cut each of the pieces in half.\\u202f<br> Assemble the cake: Unroll the sponge cake and pipe some of the untinted frosting on the cake. Spread evenly. Beginning about 1 inch from the end of the curled edge, place the kiwi halves upright into the frosting. Pipe rows of frosting on each side of the kiwi until the frosting is the same height as the cut pieces of fruit. Place the peeled clementines on top of the kiwi with the stem ends toward the open ends of the sponge roll. Use more frosting to fill in the gaps around the clementines. Roll the fruit into the cake and trim the edge of the sponge so that no seam remains and the 2 ends of the sponge cake meet. Roll the assembled sponge cake in parchment paper and a layer of plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.<br> Spread a large sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Pipe red, yellow and orange stripes of frosting side-by-side on the plastic wrap so that all 3 colors touch each other. Roll the frosting into the plastic sausage-style and snip one end. Place the frosting roll in a large piping bag fitted with a large open star tip. Squeeze the frosting out onto a test plate until all 3 colors extrude evenly.\\u202f<br> Remove the cake from the refrigerator and pipe a fat, undulating rope down the top center of the cake; immediately top with the sprinkles. Use the reserved green frosting bag fitted with the 1/8-inch round decorator tip to pipe vines on top of the center dcor. Use the green frosting bag fitted with the leaf tip to pipe leaves around the vines. Trim the ends from the cake roll using a serrated knife to reveal the kiwifruit and clementine \\pumpkin\\ inside the filled cake.<br> Keep the cake refrigerated until ready to serve. Cut the cake chilled for the neatest slices.\\u202f<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59675,&quot;Cabbage Rolls with Red Salsa 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1 jalapeno cl, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups canned plum tomatoes with their juices Pinch of sugar to taste 1 head green cabbage 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1/2 pound ground pork 1/2 pound ground beef 1 large egg, beaten 2/3 cup fresh bread crumbs 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 ounces Cotija cheese, crumbled (about 1/2 cup) Instructions: Prepare salsa: Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, jalapeno and salt and saute for 1 minute longer. Add the tomatoes with their juices and reduce the heat to low. Cook the tomatoes, stirring occasionally, until soft and juices have reduced by half, about 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust seasonings with salt, pepper and sugar to taste. Transfer the tomato mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside. Prepare cabbage rolls: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Core the cabbage and drop it into the boiling water. Boil the cabbage until the leaves loosen and come off easily, using tongs to separate the leaves. Immerse the leaves in cold water, then drain completely on paper towels. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin and oregano, and saute 1 minute longer. Remove from heat and let cool. In a bowl, combine the pork, beef, cooled onion, egg, bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix well and divide into 12 portions. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare the cabbage leaves by cutting out the tough part of the central stem from the lower part of each leaf. Spread each leaf with a portion of the filling and roll into a cylinder, enclosing the filling completely. (You may need to overlap a few small leaves if you run out of big leaves). Place the stuffed cabbage rolls in a 9 by 13inch baking dish, folded side down. Pour the salsa over the cabbage rolls and bake, covered, for 1 hour or until the cabbage is very tender. Transfer cabbage rolls to individual plates or a serving platter, sprinkle with the Cotija cheese and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 59676,&quot;Walnut and Blue Cheese Wedge 1 tsp. vegetable oil 2 Tbsp. honey 3/4 cup Fisher?

Put the banana chunks and vanilla bean seeds in a food processor and process. Hang on, your food processor may jolt in the very beginning! The bananas will look crumbly at first, then gooey and eventually light and creamy- just like ice cream. Stop the food processor frequently to scrape down the sides of the bowl and break up any clumps. Transfer to a bowl and put in the freezer. For the chocolate banana ice cream: Cut each banana into 6 chunks and freeze until rock solid, preferably overnight. Put the banana chunks, cocoa powder and coconut oil in a food processor and process. Stop the food processor frequently to scrape down the sides of the bowl and break up any clumps. Transfer to a bowl and put in the freezer. For the strawberry banana ice cream: Cut each banana into 6 chunks and freeze until rock solid, preferably overnight. Put the banana chunks and strawberries in a food processor and process. Stop the food processor frequently to scrape down the sides of the bowl and break up any clumps. To assemble the Neapolitan banana ice cream: Scrape the vanilla-banana ice cream into 1 end of an 8-by-5-inch loaf pan so it fills about 1/3 of the length of the pan. Use a rubber spatula to push it back a bit if you need to before adding the chocolate-banana ice cream next to it, filling the middle third of the pan (it&#39;s ok if they run together a bit). Scrape the strawberry-banana ice cream into the other end of the pan. Serve right away or freeze until ready to serve. To serve, run an ice cream scoop down the loaf pan to make 3-flavored scoops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 59690,&quot;Cranberry-Orange Cinnamon Rolls 3/4 cup water 1 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 2 tablespoons plus 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/3 cup nonfat milk powder, sifted if needed 1 teaspoon salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the bowl 2 large egg yolks 1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus more for the baking dish 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup chopped dried cranberries 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest 1 stick unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the baking dish 2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 tablespoons whole-berry cranberry sauce Instructions: Make the dough: Heat the water to 100 degrees F in a bowl in the microwave. (It should feel warm but not too hot.) Sprinkle the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar over the top and stir to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, milk powder, salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Whisk the melted butter and egg yolks into the yeast mixture, then pour into the well and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together into a shaggy ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, dust with more flour and knead, adding more flour as needed, until smooth but still slightly sticky, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a buttered bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> Make the filling: Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, dried cranberries and cinnamon in a small bowl. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface, pat and roll out into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Mix the orange zest into the butter, then spread over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on one long side. Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar and lightly press into the butter. Brush the clean edge with water, then tightly roll up the dough into a log, starting with a long side and rolling toward the clean edge; pinch the seam to seal. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and lightly sprinkle with granulated sugar. Slice the dough log into 12 pieces and arrange cut-side up in the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour, or you can refrigerate overnight, then in the morning let stand at room temperature 2 hours before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Uncover the rolls and bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

While hot, carefully open package and dump into a large bowl. Toast the pumpkin seeds in a large skillet over medium-high heat, until browned and popping, tossing and stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. (Do this in batches, if needed.) Add to the popcorn. Make caramel: Warm the cream over low heat and keep warm while you cook the sugar. Put the sugar and corn syrup and in a deep, heavy-bottomed large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, raise heat to medium-high, and simmer until the sugar reaches the hard crack stage, or 305 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 7 minutes. Whisk the butter and salt into the sugar mixture. Gradually pour in the cream and vanilla taking care since the mixture will bubble up. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar reaches soft ball stage, 240 degrees F on the thermometer, about 5 minutes more. Immediately remove from the heat and stir in the cinnamon and cayenne. Cool for about a minute. Pour caramel over the popcorn and stir to evenly coat. When the popcorn is cool enough to handle, coat your hands with some butter and shape into 4-inch balls. Wrap in waxed paper and tie with a string, if desired.

Line 3 sheet pans with parchment. Using a 9-inch cake pan and a Sharpie, trace around the cake pan to create a 9-inch circle on each piece of parchment. Using a 6-inch cake pan and a Sharpie, trace around the cake pan to create a 6-inch circle next to the 9-inch circle on each piece of parchment; flip the parchment pieces over so the ink is facing down but you can still see the outline of the circles. Set aside. Sift together the almond flour and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the food coloring and 2 tablespoons of the egg whites but do not stir. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the salt and remaining egg whites and give it a quick stir. Set aside. In a saucepan, add the lemon juice and 1/3 cup water, then the granulated sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring gently and brushing down any sugar granules that are clinging to the side of the pan with a damp pastry brush, until the sugar has completely melted. Continue to heat, without stirring or agitating the mixture, until the syrup reaches 235 degrees F. Then, start the mixer with the egg whites on high. Continue to heat the syrup, without stirring, until it reaches a final temperature of 245 degrees F. At this point, make sure the egg whites are nice and foamy, then carefully pour the sugar syrup down the side of the bowl, being careful not to pour it on the moving whisk (DANGER!). Whisk on high until the whites are bright white and shiny but not yet holding a stiff peak. Add the meringue to the bowl with the confectioners&#39; sugar and almond flour and fold together until the batter is smooth, the consistency of ketchup and shiny. Transfer the meringue batter to the prepared pastry bag. On one of the 9-inch circles, pipe the batter in a spiral just large enough to fill the circle by starting in the very center and piping tight circles to the edge of the outline. Pipe the batter in the 6-inch circle in the same manner. Repeat with the remaining circles on each sheet pan. If you have additional batter, pipe quarter-size dollops or hearts on the empty spaces on the sheet pans. Gently tap the sheet pans on a work surface a few times to release any air bubbles and allow to sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes to form a \\skin.<br> Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Bake the macaron shells, opening the oven door during baking very quickly once or twice if it&#39;s very humid to allow moisture to escape, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow the shells to cool completely before filling. For the German buttercream: Combine the egg yolks, granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk until smooth. In a large saucepan, bring the heavy cream and milk to a simmer. With the mixer running on medium speed, slowly add the hot cream/milk mixture to the bowl by pouring it down the side and into the egg yolk mixture, mixing to completely combine. Transfer the mixture back into the saucepan and heat, whisking CONSTANTLY over medium-low heat, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of mayonnaise and starts to bubble, about 5 minutes. Transfer the hot pastry cream to the CLEAN bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a CLEAN whisk attachment and mix until the mixture has cooled to room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the butter a few tablespoons at a time, whisking between each addition. Continue adding and whisking until the mixture thickens and has transformed into a spreadable filling. You may not need the entire pound of butter. Remove a third of the filling to a small bowl and stir in the lemon extract. In the remaining buttercream in the mixing bowl, add the blackberry jam and mix until smooth and combined. Transfer the fillings to separate large pastry bags fitted with large open star tips. On the flat side of one of the large macaron rounds, arrange blackberries around the perimeter, leaving about 1/2 inch of space between each. Evenly space more blackberries in the center. Pipe the blackberry buttercream around the blackberries. Top with a second large macaron round and repeat with the remaining blackberries and buttercream. Top with the third large macaron round. Repeat with the smaller macaron rounds, using the raspberries and lemon buttercream. Stack the smaller round on top of the larger one, or use a tiered cake stand to separate the two layers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59705,&quot;Easy Pizza Dough 3 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour 2 packages dry active yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water from the tap 1/2 teaspoon olive oil Flour, for the work surface Cornmeal, to dust Instructions: In a mixing bowl fitted with a dough hook, place flour, yeast, salt and sugar. While mixer is running, gradually add water and knead on low speed until dough is firm and smooth, about 10 minutes. Turn machine off. Pour oil down inside of bowl. Turn on low once more for 15 seconds to coat inside of bowl and all surfaces of dough with the oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm spot until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. If using a pizza stone, place stone in oven on bottom rack, preheat oven 1 hour ahead. Punch dough down, cut in half. Place half of the dough on generously floured work surface. By hand, form dough loosely into a ball and stretch into a circle. Using a floured rolling pin, roll dough into large circle until very thin. Don&#39;t worry if your circle isn&#39;t perfect and if you get a hole just pinch the edges back together. To prevent dough from sticking to counter, turn over the dough and sprinkle with flour. Also, flour the counter top and rolling pin as needed. Sprinkle pizza peel or cookie sheet generously with cornmeal. Transfer dough to pizza peel or cookie sheet with no lip. Add toppings. Slide dough onto pizza stone or place cookie sheet with pizza on bottom rack. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden.

Spoon some chimichurri over the meat, drizzle with lime juice, garnish with parsley, and serve with the remaining sauce at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 59712,&quot;Stained Glass Cookies 1 package (17.5 ounces) sugar cookie mix (recommended: Betty Crocker) 1/3 cup cream cheese, softened in microwave for 45 seconds 1 egg 1 teaspoon lemon extract 3 tablespoons cake flour 8 ounces hard candies, assorted colors (recommended: Jolly Ranchers or LifeSavers) Baking sheets Aluminum foil and cooking spray Mixing bowl Flour Rolling pin Oversized (4 to 5-inch) ornament-shaped cookie cutter Smaller cutters, round or square Cooling rack Instructions: Line baking sheets with aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Alternatively, you can use a silicone baking mat. In a large bowl, stir together all ingredients, except hard candies, until dough ball forms. Split dough in half and form into disks. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thick. Cut out cookies with oversized (4 to 5-inch) ornament-shaped cookie cutters. Place cookies on prepared baking sheets spaced 1-inch apart. On each of the large cookies, cut out 3 or 4 smaller shapes using 1/2 to 1-inch cookie cutters. If cookies are to be used as ornaments, make a hole at the top with a straw. Chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes. While cookies chill, place unwrapped hard candies, sorted by color, in separate zip-top resealable bags. Squeeze air from bags and seal; crush candies with rolling pin. Set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove cookies from refrigerator and fill centers of cookies with crushed hard candies. Bake for 9 to 12 minutes or until edges just start to turn golden. Cool completely on baking sheet on a rack. Repeat with remaining dough. Store completely cooled cookies separated by waxed paper in an air-tight container for 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 59713,&quot;Game Night Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Blue cheese aioli, see recipe 4 TYSON? Chicken Breast Fillets Store-bought Wing Sauce Good quality buns Lettuce (sturdy lettuce like romaine) Tomato 1 cup of blue cheese, crumbled 1 1/2 cup of mayonnaise Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F. Prepare Tyson chicken according to package directions. Remove from oven and keep oven on. While chicken is cooking place crumbled blue cheese, mayonnaise, salt and pepper in a food processor. Pulse for 10-15 seconds or until thoroughly combined. Remove from processor and set aside. In a large bowl combine wing sauce and cayenne pepper. Toss cooked chicken with wing sauce to coat. Place chicken back onto baking sheet. Top each fillet with one slice of cheese. Heat 4-5 minutes or until cheese melts. While cheese is melting, spread blue cheese aioli onto the cut side of each bun. Place lettuce and tomato on bun bottoms. Add the chicken breast and top with the other half of bun. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 59714,&quot;Silence of the Leg O&#39; Lamb 1 sirloin end leg of lamb, boned, and trussed 4 cloves garlic 8 fresh mint leaves 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons black pepper 5 tablespoons strong mustard, such as Dijon 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 sprigs fresh rosemary Instructions: Roughly chop the garlic cloves in the food processor. Add the mint and repeat. Add the brown sugar, salt, pepper, mustard, and oil and blend to a paste. Spread the paste evenly on the meat side of the roast. Roll the leg into a roast shape and tie with cotton butcher&#39;s twine. Fire 2 quarts (1 chimney&#39;s worth) of charcoal (natural chunk is best). When charcoal is lightly covered with gray ash, split the coals into 2 piles and move them to the far sides of the cooker. Close the lid and allow the grate to heat. Then, place the lamb, skin side up, on the middle of the hot grate. Add the rosemary sprigs to the charcoal briquettes and close the lid and grill. After 20 minutes, flip the roast and rotate it 180 degrees. Insert the probe thermometer into the roast and continue to grill until it reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the roast at 135 degrees. Remove the butcher&#39;s twine from the roast. Cover with foil and rest it for 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 59715,&quot;Red Wine Granita One 16-ounce package frozen mixed berries 1/2 cup sugar<br> 2 cups red wine, such as Pinot Noir<br> Mint leaves and fresh berries, for garnish<br> Instructions: Combine the frozen berries, sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Puree in a food processor and strain through a fine wire-mesh strainer, pressing the fruit with a wooden spoon to release the juices. Let cool. (Or place over an ice water bath to cool quickly.) Combine the syrup with the wine in a bowl. Pour into a 9-inch square metal pan. Freeze, scraping the mixture occasionally with a fork to create ice crystals, until firm, 4 to 6 hours. Spoon the granita into serving glasses and garnish with mint and fresh berries. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 59716,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Easy S&#39;mores Truffles 2 cups milk chocolate chips One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> 2 cups mini marshmallows 1 cup crushed cinnamon graham crackers<br> Instructions: For the truffle base: In a double boiler (you know the rules, don&#39;t let that water touch the bottom of your top pot or bowl), add the milk chocolate, sweetened condensed milk, bittersweet chocolate and salt. Cook until the mixture reduces in volume and slightly thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a tray and then refrigerate until solid, about 3 hours. For the coating. Set the oven to broil or the highest temperature possible on your oven and preheat. On a large parchment paper-lined baking sheet with edges, add the marshmallows in 1 layer. Broil until the marshmallows are black: not brown, but black. If the oven is uneven, rotate the tray during broiling, but it needs to char them black. Have the strength to wait. Allow the marshmallows to cool completely; sliding the parchment off the sheet onto a plate and placing it in the fridge helps. Once the marshmallows are hardened completely, remove and finely chop. Add them to a large bowl with the graham cracker crumbs and stir to combine. Remove the truffle base from the refrigerator and, using a small scoop or spoon, make several balls a bit smaller than a golf ball or the size of a shooter marble. Roll these in the graham/marshmallow coating and place on a tray. Repeat with the rest of the truffle base and coating and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve the truffles chilled or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 59717,&quot;Bacon-Stuffed Burgers 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese 4 slices bacon, chopped 1 pound ground beef chuck<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Vegetable oil, for brushing the grill pan 4 large sweet Hawaiian buns, such as King&#39;s Hawaiian, split Instructions: Combine the cheese and bacon in a bowl.

Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the eggplant slices with 1/3 cup olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the eggplant until tender and colored with grill marks, about 4 minutes per side. Set aside.<br> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta.<br> Meanwhile, warm the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and saute until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the beef and pork, and brown the meat, breaking it into bite-sized pieces with a wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Add the Marsala and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Add the peas and marinara sauce and stir to combine. Add the cheeses, basil, and cooked pasta. Set aside.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the springform pan with the grilled eggplant. Be sure that the slices overlap and hang over the edge of the pan. Fill the pan with the pasta mixture, pressing down to make sure the pan is filling up evenly. Fold the eggplant slices up over the top of the pasta and add a few more slices on top to completely enclose the timbale. Bake the timbale until warmed through and the cheese has melted, about 30 minutes. Let rest on the counter for 10 minutes to set. To serve, invert the timbale onto a serving plate and remove the springform pan. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese over the top.

Lightly butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Bring the milk and 1 1/4 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat and set aside. Beat the butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add the granulated sugar, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla and beat at medium speed for 1 minute. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating for 1 minute after each addition. Reduce the mixer to low and beat in the flour mixture in four additions. Carefully pour the hot milk mixture into the batter. Stir using a rubber spatula until smooth. Evenly divide the batter between the prepared pans and lightly tap the pans on the counter. Bake until the cakes begin to pull away from sides of the pans and the centers spring back when pressed gently, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert onto the rack and cool completely. Peel the parchment from the bottoms. Beat the cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the confectioners&#39; sugar, vanilla and salt. Gradually increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is fluffy and smooth, about 3 minutes. With the mixer running on medium-high speed, slowly pour in the heavy cream until it is fully incorporated. Continue beating until the frosting is slightly lighter in color and creamy, about 1 minute more. Put one cake round on a serving plate; spread about one-third of the frosting over the top, going to the edge of the cake. Place the second cake round on top.

Set aside. Heat a 6-quart heavy-bottomed pressure cooker over high heat until hot. Add the meat in 3 or 4 batches and brown on all sides, approximately 2 minutes per batch. Once each batch is browned, place the meat in a clean large bowl. Once all of the meat is browned, add the beer to the cooker to deglaze the pot. Scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the meat back to the pressure cooker along with the salsa, tortilla chips, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, and ground cumin and stir to combine. Lock the lid in place according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. When the steam begins to hiss out of the cooker, reduce the heat to low, just enough to maintain a very weak whistle.

Fill each cup all the way to the top with melted chocolate. Invert the paper cup over the bowl of chocolate and allow the excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Place the paper cups upside down on a wire rack placed over a parchment paper covered baking sheet and allow the chocolate to set. When use a sharp paring knife to gently trim the chocolate off the bottom (opening) of each hat. Then peel off the paper cone. To adhere the M&amp;Ms baking bits to the hats, heat the tip of a paring knife in boiling water. Dry it off and gently press it against the chocolate hat to melt the spot for the candy. Immediately press an M&amp;M into the chocolate hat. Use as many as you like to decorate hat. For the Raisin Creme Brulee: Hydrate the raisins by placing the raisins in a mixing bowl or glass jar and add water so that it covers the raisins by at least 1/2 inch. Stir in the rum or flavored alcohol. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours. It is even better to allow the raisins to hydrate for 2 to 3 days; they will become very plump as they absorb the liquid. You can keep them in the refrigerator for a few weeks. When you are ready to use them, strain the amount that you need through a fine-mesh sieve before adding them to the recipe. Preheat the oven to 320 degrees. Sprinkle the hydrated raisins over the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan with 2-inch-high sides. Pour the heavy cream and milk into a nonreactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and set over medium heat. Use a sharp paring knife to slice the vanilla bean in half again, this time lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the bean with the knife. Place the skin and seeds in the heating cream. Scald the cream by heating it until bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan. Remove from heat. Place the whole eggs, egg yolks, and sugar in a large mixing bowl and whisk until well incorporated. Continue to whisk as you slowly pour the hot cream into the egg mixture. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and homogenous in color. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces and any overcooked eggs. Your next step will be made easier if you strain the mixture into a large measuring cup with a spout. Place the cake pan on a baking sheet with 1-inch high sides. Fill the cake pan with the custard and set the baking sheet in the oven. Use hot water from the tap and pour enough water onto the baking sheet to reach halfway up the side of the pan. If you are using a convection oven, a water bath is not needed because the even circulation of the air insulates the custard from the direct heat of the oven. If using a convection oven, preheat to 200 degrees. Baking time is about the same for either oven, about 50 minutes When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken. If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is underbaked. Put it back in the oven and shake it every 5 minutes until it is ready. Remove the mold from the oven and the water bath and place on a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving; it will finish setting in the refrigerator. Let the water bath cool before removing it from the oven. *See Puff Pastry recipe and insert here(separate recipe because of space limitations). For assembling the clown hats, use a paring knife to carefully cut a small circle from the top of each puff pastry shell. Set the top aside to use later. Use your finger to remove the doughy inside from the shell. Fill the shell with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and reposition the puff pastry circle. Place the clown hat on top of the puff pastry. Decorate the plate with fruit sauces. For the Caramelized Banana Saute: Peel and dice the banana into 1/4-inch cubes. Place them in a small mixing bowl with the rum or Grand Marnier and about 1/3 of the sugar and let macerate for 10 minutes. Heat a medium-size heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat. If it starts to smoke, the pan is too hot and you need to run it under cool water, dry it, and start again. When warm, sprinkle the remaining sugar into the pan. Try to keep the sugar in an even layer to allow it to caramelize at the same time. As soon as you see the sugar begin to melt. Start moving the pan over the burner to keep the sugar from burning. Tilt the pan from side to side so that the melted sugar runs over the unmelted sugar. Cook until all of sugar is light golden brown. I usually add the butter at this stage because it makes the caramel smoother. Add the banana mixture and spread it evenly in the pan. Let cook over medium-high heat until most of the liquid has evaporated and the bananas are soft but not mushy. If the bananas are still firm when most of the liquid has evaporated, add a few tablespoons of water and continue cooking until they are ready. Remove from the heat and pour the caramelized bananas onto a plate. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside. For the Raspberry Sauce: Puree the raspberries in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Add the sugar 2 tablespoons at a time, incorporating it well after each addition and making sure any lumps are dissolved. Add lemon juice and blend again. Strain the sweetened puree through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. This will separate the pulp from the fruit puree and remove any small seeds. Stir the puree until completely smooth. For the Mango Sauce: Peel and remove pits of mangos. Chop into medium-size pieces. Puree the fruit until completely smooth. Add sugar 2 tablespoons at a time, incorporating it well after each addition and making sure any lumps are dissolved. Strain the sweetened puree through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. Stir the puree until completely smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 59729,&quot;Gluten-Free Sugar-Glazed Doughnuts 520 grams Gluten-Free Pastry Flour Mix, recipe follows, plus more if necessary 1/2 teaspoon psyllium husk<br> 1 tablespoon instant yeast<br> 210 grams whole milk (about 3/4 cup)<br> 1/3 cup cane sugar<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 60 grams (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the bowl Pure olive oil, for frying (you can also use canola or safflower oil) 1/4 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 400 grams white rice flour 300 grams tapioca flour 150 grams cornstarch 100 grams millet 50 grams milk powder Instructions: Whisk the dry ingredients: Put the flour, psyllium and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk them together on low speed to aerate the flour.<br> Heat the milk: Set a small pot on low heat. Pour in the milk and heat until just warm (75 degrees F if you are using a thermometer). Turn off the heat.<br> Make the doughnuts: With the stand mixer running at low speed, add the sugar, salt and warm milk to the flour mixture.<br> With the mixer still running at low speed, add 1 egg at a time until all the eggs are fully incorporated into the batter. Dribble in the vanilla extract. Scrape the batter down the sides of the bowl fully. Run the mixer until the batter is airy and light, about 5 minutes.<br> Add the butter: Scrape down the sides of the bowl again. With the mixer running at low speed, add the butter, one cube at a time, until fully incorporated into the batter.<br> At this point, the dough should gather around the paddle of the stand mixer and gently slump off when you turn the mixer off. If it feels too wet, add a bit more flour. Turn the dough onto a lightly-floured surface. Wet your hands lightly.<br> Gently pat the dough, which will be sticky. Don&#39;t worry. That&#39;s why you wet your hands. Gently shape the dough, stretching and pulling as you can, into a large ball. Make a seam with the edges of the dough together. Put the dough, seam-side down, into a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm place in the kitchen for 1 hour.<br> Roll out the dough: With wet hands, gather the dough and plop it onto a lightly-floured piece of parchment paper. Flour a rolling pin and roll out the dough just shy of the edges of the parchment paper. (Remember to go slowly. This will not feel like gluten dough.) The dough should be about 1-inch thick. Put the parchment paper onto a baking sheet and place it in the freezer for 10 minutes.<br> Cut out the doughnuts: Using a 3-inch doughnut cutter (or biscuit cutter or an empty tin can, if that&#39;s all you have), cut out 8 rounds from the dough. Cut holes in the rounds with a much smaller cutter. (You could also use your finger.) Set them aside on a piece of parchment paper.<br> You can roll out the remaining dough and cut out more doughnuts, if you want. They won&#39;t be quite as light as the first batch, but they are still doughnuts!<br> Let the doughnuts rest while you prepare the oil.<br> Heat the oil: Set a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Pour in enough oil to fill the pot 1/3 of the way. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the doughnuts: Using a slotted spoon, gently lower a doughnut into the hot oil. Add three more doughnuts.<br> Fry the doughnuts for 30 seconds on one side, then 45 seconds on the other side, then another 30 to 45 seconds on the first side again, until the doughnuts are a deep golden brown.<br> Remove the doughnuts to a baking rack set over a baking sheet. Fry the remaining doughnuts the same way.<br> Make the glaze: Whisk together the milk and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Continue whisking as you add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Whisk until all the lumps of sugar have been blended into a smooth glaze.<br> Dunk the warm doughnuts into the sugar glaze and return them to the cooling rack.<br> Eat immediately. Doughnuts are really only good the day they are made and they&#39;re best within an hour of being made. Pour all the flours and milk powder into a large container. (Restaurant supply stores sell large plastic containers that fit this purpose well. You could also use a large glass jar.) Shake and shake and shake harder until all the flours have become one color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59730,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Meatloaf Burgers 1 1/2 cups ketchup 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons sriracha<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 white onion, chopped<br> 8 to 10 fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 stale slices white bread, rubbed between hands to make sand<br> 1 large egg<br> One 212-milliliter jar sun-dried tomato or basil pesto (about 3/4 cup)<br> 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 ounces freshly grated Parmesan 2 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp<br> 1 pound ground chuck (80/20)<br> 3 to 4 burger buns, warmed Thin potato chips, for topping<br> Instructions: For the sauce: Combine the ketchup, vinegar, sriracha and pepper in a small pot. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and refrigerate. For the patties: Add the olive oil to a small pan on medium-high heat, then add the onion, oregano, thyme, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon water. Stir to coat everything and cook until the onions are translucent but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the bread, egg, pesto, Worsterschire sauce, Parmesan and garlic in a medium bowl. Add the sauteed onions to the breadcrumb mixture and stir to completely combine. Break up the beef in a large bowl with your hands or a wooden spatula. Add the breadcrumb mixture and gently mix together. Preheat the grill for cooking with direct and indirect heat at 350 degrees F or heat a pan over medium-high heat. Evenly divide the mixture into 3 or 4 balls and form into patties. Place on the direct heat of the grill or into the pan. Cook on one side until the patties release, 5 to 6 minutes, then flip, transferring to the indirect heat of the grill. If using a pan, simply lower the heat and cover the patties with a lid or upside-down metal bowl. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 5 to 6 minutes more. Remove from the heat and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. For the burgers: Add a patty to each bun bottom, then top with the sauce and a pile of potato chips. Top with the bun tops. Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 59731,&quot;Best Chocolate Chip Cookies 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips<br> Instructions: Arrange racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl until completely combined. Beat the butter, oil, granulated sugar and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium-high speed until creamy, about 5 minutes. The mixture will look broken but that&#39;s ok. Beat in 1 teaspoon water and the vanilla until smooth. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the eggs one at a time until incorporated. Beat in the dry ingredients until just combined. Fold in 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips. Reserve the rest.<br> Drop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Lightly press about 3 of the remaining chocolate chips into each cookie.<br> Bake the cookies until they are a deep golden brown, rotating the pans halfway through, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with any remaining dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59732,&quot;Marshmallow Igloo Cake with Polar Friends Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing the pans All-purpose flour, for dusting the pans One 15.25-ounce box white cake mix (plus required ingredients) One 7-ounce jar marshmallow creme 1 cake doughnut One 16-ounce container vanilla frosting Three 10-ounce bags regular marshmallows About 4 cups granulated sugar 8 miniature marshmallows 3 brown candy-coated chocolate candies 6 small candy eyes<br> About 1 cup coarsely crushed blue rock candy<br> 1 jumbo marshmallow 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped chocolate-covered almonds, peanuts or malt balls 3 red gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 2 orange gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 2 light pink gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 2 yellow gummy bears, snipped into small pieces 1 wheel black licorice lace 4 fish gummy candies 2 chocolate licorice twists, halved crosswise Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting, optional Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8-inch round cake pan and 8-inch half-sphere cake pan with cooking spray and dust with flour, tapping out the excess (see Cook&#39;s Note). Prepare the cake batter according to the package directions. Pour a little more than half the batter into the half-sphere pan and pour the remaining batter into the round pan. Bake until the cake round is baked through and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and continue baking the half-sphere until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove to a rack to cool. Remove the cakes from the pans while still warm and let cool completely on the rack.<br> For the igloo and polar bears: If the top of either cake domed while baking, shave it flat with a serrated knife before proceeding. Place the cake round bottom-side down on a large rimmed serving tray. Spread the top of the cake with the marshmallow creme almost to the edge (a wet offset spatula is helpful when spreading the creme). Place the half-sphere cake flat-side down on top of the cake round.<br> Cut the doughnut in half to make 2 half circles, trimming the insides of the pieces if necessary to make 2 arched doorways for the igloo. Frost the 2 pieces, stick them together so you have a short tunnel and attach it to the igloo with more frosting. Spread the remaining frosting all over the cake and doorway.<br> Set aside 8 regular marshmallows, then snip the remaining regular marshmallows in half from top to bottom (lengthwise) with sharp kitchen shears. Starting at the base of the cake and continuing in a circle, press the cut side of the marshmallows into the frosting to adhere to the igloo, packing the pieces as close as possible so almost no frosting shows through. Continue adding snipped marshmallows in rows until you reach the top. Add more snipped marshmallows to finish the doorway, quartering some lengthwise if necessary to make a tight fit. Cut 1 of the remaining whole regular marshmallows in half crosswise and put one piece on the very top of the igloo. Spread the granulated sugar around the cake on the tray to make drifts of snow. To make 3 polar bear heads: Snip a thin piece from one of the flat ends of 3 regular marshmallows to make them sticky. Flip the marshmallows over onto a plate so the untrimmed flat sides are face up. Snip a thin piece from the top and bottom of 3 mini marshmallows, then adhere a marshmallow to the center of each of the heads (these are the bases of the noses). Press a brown chocolate candy onto each mini marshmallow. To make eyes, use a toothpick to hollow out 2 sticky patches on each head, then apply a set of candy eyes to each. Cut 3 mini marshmallow in half crosswise and attach 2 pieces to the top of each head for ears.<br> To make the floating polar bear: Clear a space in the sugar snow with your fingers for a pool. Add the rock candy. Place one of the polar bear heads on the rock candy so it looks like it is peeking out of the water. Snip 2 regular marshmallows in half diagonally to make 4 triangular pieces. Arrange the pieces in the pool for paws. To make the sitting polar bears: Snip a disc from both the top and bottom flat ends of the remaining 2 regular marshmallows, then cut each disc into half-moons. Arrange 4 of the half-moon pieces cut-side up in a square to form front and back paws; arrange the other 4 in another square. Snip the jumbo marshmallow in half diagonally, then place one piece on each set of paws cut-side up, with the round end at the front set of paws. Attach a polar bear head to the upper third of the round end of each jumbo marshmallow piece. Snip an end from the remaining 2 mini marshmallows and attach one to each jumbo marshmallow piece for a tail. Sit the polar bears on the sugar.<br> For the campfire and fish: Sprinkle the chopped chocolate pieces in a circle to resemble dirt for a fire pit. Pile the red, orange, pink and yellow snipped gummy bears in the center to resemble a campfire and embers.<br> To make a fish over the fire: Cut an 8-inch piece of black licorice lace. Cut a small slit near the tail of 1 fish with the tip of a paring knife, making sure not to cut all the way through the tail. Thread the licorice lace through the slit and tie a knot on one end. Slide the fish down so it is secured by the knot. Lay the fish down on a work surface and lay 3 of licorice twist pieces on top of the fish so the tail of the fish and the end of the twisted licorice candies line up (eat or discard the fourth piece of licorice twist). Wrap the black licorice lace around the top of the licorice twists to keep them in a bundle, then tuck in the lace so it stays put. Stand the bundle upright and separate the licorice twists to form a tripod. Place it over the fire with the fish hanging in the middle.<br> For the fish on the line: Make a small slit near the tails of the 3 remaining fish with the tip of a paring knife, making sure not to cut all the way through the tails. Thread the remaining piece of black licorice lace through the slits. Tuck the ends of the licorice lace into the side of the igloo near the fire and arrange the fish so they hang down. Sprinkle the cake and bears with the confectioners&#39; sugar for a snow effect, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59733,&quot;Cauliflower Crust Pizza 1 small head cauliflower, chopped (5 to 6 cups)<br> 1 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 egg<br> 1 1/2 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella<br> 1/2 cup marinara sauce<br> 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn<br> Instructions: Special equipment: a pizza stone and peel or two rimless baking sheets Place a pizza stone or rimless baking sheet in the oven; preheat to 475 degrees F. Add the cauliflower to a food processor; pulse until finely ground, about the consistency of couscous. Pour the cauliflower onto a clean kitchen towel (I like flour sack towels for this) and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. To a large bowl, add the cauliflower, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, garlic, salt, some black pepper and the egg. Mix until the mixture holds together when pinched. Line a pizza peel or a second rimless baking sheet with parchment paper; liberally brush with olive oil. Spread the cauliflower mixture into a 12-inch-wide circle on the parchment. Slide the parchment onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake until the cauliflower crust is barely golden and darker at the edges, about 15 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven, sprinkle with the mozzarella and spread the marinara sauce over the top (this keeps the crust dry). Slide the pizza back onto the pizza stone or baking sheet and bake until bubbly and browned in spots, about 4 minutes. Scatter the basil over the top. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 59734,&quot;Trail Mix Butter 1/2 cup coarsely chopped unsalted raw pecans 1/2 cup coarsely chopped unsalted raw walnuts 1/2 cup unsalted raw cashew nuts 1/4 cup unsalted raw peanuts 1/4 cup unsalted raw sunflower seeds 2 tablespoons coconut oil Kosher salt 1/4 cup golden raisins 1/4 cup coarsely chopped dried pineapple 1 tablespoon honey, maple syrup or granulated sugar Crunchy topping, such as toasted coconut flakes, mini chocolate chips, crushed banana chips, peanut butter chips or favorite cereal, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment. Put the pecans, walnuts, cashews, peanuts and sunflower seeds on the prepared baking sheet and roast until fragrant and barely golden, about 6 minutes. Cool the nuts and seeds for 5 minutes.<br> Transfer the nuts and seeds to a food processor and add the coconut oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Blend, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary with a rubber spatula, until smooth, 4 to 7 minutes. The nut mixture will go from coarsely chopped, to fine meal, to clumpy ball, to smooth and creamy. Once the nut butter is smooth, add the raisins, pineapple and sweetener of choice and blend until the raisins and pineapple are finely chopped, about 1 minute.<br> Transfer the nut butter to a medium bowl, cover and allow to cool fully, about 1 hour. Once the nut butter is cool, serve with a crunchy topping of choice or transfer to an airtight container for storage. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or at room temperature for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 59735,&quot;Gravlachs: Sockeye Salmon Cold-Cured with Fresh Dill 1 frozen Alaska sockeye salmon 2 tablespoons course kosher-style salt 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/2 tablespoon course-crushed black pepper Fresh dill 1 teaspoon dry mustard 2 teaspoons sugar 2 teaspoons wheat flour White vinegar 1 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill 3 tablespoons whipped cream or artificial substitute Instructions: Thaw sockeye salmon that has been frozen for at least 1 week. Remove backbone and ribs, but leave the skin. Combine salt, sugar, and pepper in a small dish, then rub into flesh of each fillet, making sure to spread mixture uniformly. Layer dill over 1 fillet, then replace the other fillet on top. Put stacked fillets in a flat-bottomed glass or ceramic casserole pan large enough to allow fillets to lie flat. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and place another dish or a clean cutting board about the same size as the fillets, over the top of the fillets. Make sure the dish/board doesn?t touch the sides of the lower pan. Place a 3 to 5 pound weight on top to compress fillets. Place in refrigerator to allow a marinade to start forming. Once a day, flip fillets, ensuring both are well soaked in marinade. Replace the plastic wrap and weight, then return to refrigerator. After 4 to 5 days, the process is complete and the gravlachs will be ready. The weight flattens the fillets, and the loss of moisture produces the distinctive firm texture of lox. The gravlachs can be eaten right away. Or slice into halves or thirds, wrap securely, and freeze. To serve, cut thin slices but leave skin behind. This is generally easiest if the gravlachs is still slightly frozen. Mild Mustard-Dill Sauce: Combine mustard, sugar, and flour, then add enough vinegar to make a thick sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of mixture to mayonnaise, then stir in chopped dill and whipped cream. Present in a small dish with a serving spoon alongside the gravlachs. Serving Suggestions: Serve atop wafer crackers or melba-style toast with cream cheese, finely chopped onions, capers. For a more traditional twist, serve mild mustard-dill sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 59736,&quot;Mint Wafers 2 (12-ounce) bags semi-sweet chocolate chips 2 tablespoons butter or shortening 2 teaspoons peppermint extract 24 vanilla wafer cookies Instructions: Melt chocolate chips and butter in a small bowl in the microwave on 50% power in 2 or 3 (30-second) intervals, whisking after each.

Let steep for 20 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh strainer, reserve 1/2 cup of the liquid and slice the steeped mushrooms. Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced onion; cook, stirring, until softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the cremini and shiitake mushrooms; saute until softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour; cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the broth and mushroom liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.<br> Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook until crisp-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain; shake off any excess water and add to the mushroom sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender and the sauce is thick, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and season with 2 teaspoons of salt and pepper.<br> For the topping: Soak the sliced onions in the buttermilk, 5 minutes. Combine the flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Heat 2 to 3 inches vegetable oil in a large pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, drain the onion, toss with the flour and shake off the excess, then fry until golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels.<br> Transfer the green bean mixture to a 4-quart baking dish and top with the fried onions. (The casserole and topping can be made up to 2 hours ahead; refrigerate the casserole. Bring to room temperature; reheat at 350 degrees F, 30 minutes.

Add half the sugar and bring to a simmer. In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar. Temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl, whisking constantly. Pour the egg mixture into the pot of milk, stirring constantly. Do not boil or cook the egg mixture, otherwise you will have scrambled eggs! The mixture should begin to thicken so that coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled. For the Sponge Cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and lay parchment paper over the bottom of a jelly roll size baking pan (17 1/2 inches by 11 1/2 inches by 1-inch deep). With an electric beater, beat together the egg yolks, just 1/4 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest), and vanilla until the mixture becomes a pale yellow and thickens. Sift cake flour over the egg yolk mixture and set aside briefly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a separate metal bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together and gradually beat in the balance of the sugar until stiff peaks form. To the egg yolk/flour bowl, fold in 1/3 of the beaten egg whites until just barely combined. Repeat two more times with each of the remaining 2/3 of the beaten egg whites. Spread into jelly roll pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and springs back when touched. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes and loosen the edges with a spatula or butter knife. Then, invert cake onto a similarly sized baking sheet without edges, by holding against the top edges of the jelly roll pan and flipping it over. Peel off parchment paper and let cool completely. Wash the jelly roll pan, to have ready for soaking the cake. For the Strawberries and Whipped Topping: Reserve 18 whole (but cleaned) berries. To begin the maceration process, slice the rest of the berries into a bowl, mix in the sugar, and refrigerate. Whip the heavy cream with an electric beater until stiff peaks form. Cook&#39;s Note: Each individual serving will have two layers of cake. You can adjust the serving size based on the way you slice the cake. If serving in martini glasses (as was done on the episode), cut the cake into rectangles which are approximately 3 inches square (a count of 4 across the width of the sheet cake and 6 along the length of the cake). This will yield 24 rectangles for 12 servings. You can also make slightly larger servings if using a flat serving plate by cutting into 12 rectangles which are about 4 inches square. Return the cake squares to the jelly roll pan and pour the cold tea over them allowing to soak. To assemble: Use a spatula to transfer a slice of cake to each of the serving glasses or plates. Spoon some of the macerated strawberries on top of each cake round and top with vanilla cream. Cover with the second layer of sponge cake, then more strawberries, then more vanilla cream, and top with a dollop of whipped cream around which you will arrange 3 whole strawberries and a sprig of fresh mint. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 59742,&quot;Salty and Sweet Popcorn Balls Cooking spray 10 cups lightly salted popped popcorn<br> 1 cup salted mini pretzels, lightly crushed<br> 1 1/2 cups peanut butter chips<br> 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 1/4 cups confectioners\\u2019 sugar<br> 1/3 cup light corn syrup<br> 1 cup mini marshmallows<br> 1/2 cup white chocolate chips<br> 3/4 cup crushed potato chips<br> Instructions: Light coat a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.

Cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until the mushrooms have softened, begun to brown and released their liquid, about 5 minutes. Raise the heat to medium and cook until the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes more. Stir in the parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Remove the skillet from the heat and let cool. On a work surface, roll 1 sheet of puff pastry into a 14-by-10-inch rectangle. Put teaspoon-sized mounds of the mushroom mixture on the pastry, evenly spacing them in 4 rows of 3. Top each mushroom mound with a piece of beef. Brush the tops of the beef with the Dijon mustard. With a sharp knife, cut the pastry into even squares around the fillings.<br> In a small bowl, whisk together the cream and egg and brush all four edges of the puff pastry squares with the egg mixture. Working one at a time, pull 2 opposite corners of pastry up over each beef piece, then fold the remaining 2 corners over the top to make a packet. Seal tightly. Invert and arrange the packets seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet and press them lightly to seal the pastry. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry, mushrooms, beef, and mustard. Bake the Wellingtons until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove to a serving platter and let cool at least 10 minutes before serving.<br> For the horseradish cream sauce: Meanwhile, stir together the sour cream, light cream, horseradish and pepper in a small bowl.

Add the shortening and pulse a few times until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the butter and pulse a few times until pea-size pieces form. Pulse in the vinegar, then pulse in the ice water until the dough starts to come together but is still clumpy (you do not want it to form a ball). Divide the dough in half and form into 2 disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each disk of dough into a very thin 12-inch round (you can also roll the dough between 2 sheets of lightly floured parchment paper). If the dough is too soft, return to the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Press 1 round of dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the excess dough, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Make the filling: Combine the boysenberries and liquid, the granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in a large bowl. Stir until well combined. Pour the berry filling into the prepared pie crust. Place the second round of dough over the pie and trim the excess to match the bottom layer. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp as desired. Cut a few slits in the top crust. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before baking. Put a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F. Brush the pie with heavy cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Put the pie on the hot baking sheet and reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 60 to 75 minutes. Transfer the pie to a rack and let cool at least 4 hours before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59749,&quot;Texas Hold-Ums Mini Chipotle Beef Burgers with Warm Fire Roasted Garlic Ketchup 2 pounds ground sirloin 1 medium onion, peeled and cut in 1/2 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, eyeball it 2 chipotles in adobo and 2 tablespoons of adobo sauce 2 tablespoons grill seasoning, a couple of palm fulls, (recommended: Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick) 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 tablespoons brown sugar 1/4 cup vinegar 1 (15-ounce) can crushed fire roasted tomatoes, about 2 cups Salt and pepper 12 slices, 1/2-inch thick, brick-cut smoked Cheddar or sharp Cheddar, (recommended: Cabot), optional 12 small round rolls, split Instructions: Preheat grill pan to high. Place the meat in a bowl. Cut the onion in half. Grate half the onion into the meat using the small grate on a box grater. Chop and reserve the other half onion. Add Worcestershire, chipotles and sauce and grill seasoning to burgers. Drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil over the bowl and mix meat. Score the meat into 4 sections. Make 3 mini-burgers, each 3 inches wide, 1-inch thick, from each half-pound of meat. Heat a small sauce pot over medium heat. Add extra-virgin olive oil and garlic. Cook garlic 2 to 3 minutes then add sugar and vinegar, cook 2 minutes more and stir in tomatoes. Season sauce with salt and pepper and allow it to reduce 5 to 6 minutes more. Grill meat 2 to 3 minutes on each side and top with cheese, if you like. Place burgers on buns and top with raw chopped onions and warm fire roasted ketchup and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 59750,&quot;Yummy Garlic and Chive Shrimp Buns 3/4 cup warm water 1/8 cup sugar 1/2 tablespoon dry yeast 1/2 tablespoon melted lard 2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 5 tablespoons water 1/2 tablespoon ginger 2 cups rock shrimp, rinsed, drained and chopped 2 cups chopped garlic chives (regular chives can be substituted) 2 eggs 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil Salt and white pepper to taste Canola oil to cook 1 to 2 cups chicken stock (may substitute water) Instructions: Mix warm water with sugar to dissolve. Add yeast and let stand for 10 minutes. Mixture should get foamy or the yeast is dead. Mix in lard. In a food processor, add flour and yeast mixture. While blade is spinning, pour in water until a ball forms. If dough is too sticky, add more flour. If dough appears dry and doesn&#39;t form a ball, add more water. As soon as a ball forms, take dough out and knead by hand on a floured surface. For 10 minutes roll dough into one long log about 2 inches thick. Cut into 2-inch pieces. In a large bowl, mix the ginger, shrimp, garlic chives, eggs and sesame oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Make thick circles of the dough and place stuffing in the middle. Encircle stuffing with the dough and seal with a little twist. Let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes. In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place shrimp buns flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the buns. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the buns are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 59751,&quot;Cilantro Oil 2 cups packed cilantro leaves 1 cup lighttasting olive oil Instructions: Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.

Cut fingerling potatoes into halves or quarters, depending on thickness of fingerlings -- thin, small fingerlings may also be left whole, larger potatoes should be quartered to speed cooking process. If you are using small red potatoes, halve or quarter them in the same way. Cover a large cookie sheet with foil. Place potatoes on cookie sheet. Combine with peppers and onions, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Coat the potatoes, peppers and onions with extra-virgin olive oil just enough to coat vegetables in a thin layer, 2 to 3 tablespoons. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Place potatoes in the oven and roast 20 to 22 minutes, until potatoes are just tender and peppers and onions are crisp at edges. Toss mixture with tongs, turning the potatoes after 15 minutes. When the potatoes are cooked, transfer them to a serving dish and peel the foil off the cookie sheet and discard for super-quick clean up! While potatoes cook, prepare chicken. Roll out a 2-foot piece of waxed paper or foil near the stove top. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat -- your pan must be very hot when the chicken is added. Pile the shredded cheese on the work surface created with the waxed paper or foil. Season your chicken breasts with black pepper but no salt; the cheese will add enough salt to the taste of the dish. Press the breasts firmly into the cheese. Coat both sides of breasts with as much cheese as possible. Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet, 1 turn of the pan. Set breasts into the skillet and cook 7 minutes on each side, until cheese forms an even, golden casing around the tender chicken breasts. While chicken cooks, combine chopped tomatoes with basil in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to your taste. Drain off any excess oil from chicken as you remove it from the skillet. Top chicken with big spoonfuls of raw sauce and serve with potatoes, peppers and onions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]</p><p>&quot; 59755,&quot;Slow-Cooker Stout Beef Stew 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 2 large onions, finely chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped<br> One 12-ounce bottle stout beer, such as Guinness Draught<br> 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons tomato paste<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> One 4-pound boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> 3 cups chicken broth<br> Instructions: In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine the potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, parsley, stout, olive oil, brown sugar and tomato paste.

Roll tablespoon-sized pieces of dough into crescent shapes. Repeat until no dough remains. Arrange on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until cookies are lightly golden. While cookies are in the oven, put 2 cups powdered sugar in a large resealable bag. Remove cookies from baking sheet and add them to the bag of powdered sugar. Carefully turn cookies in sugar while they are still hot. Remove cookies from bag and shake lightly to remove excess sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59769,&quot;One-Bite Baked Brie with Grape-Pecan Compote 2 cups small red grapes 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/4 cup pecans 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon lemon zest Kosher salt One 8-ounce wheel Brie Two 1.9-ounce packages mini phyllo shells (about 30) Coarsely ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the grapes with the oil on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, tossing once, until the grapes burst and are very soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the pecans out on a second rimmed baking sheet, and bake until very golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool, then finely chop. Transfer the grapes to a small shallow bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving the oil behind. Stir in the lemon juice and zest and a pinch of salt; set aside to cool completely, then stir in the toasted pecans. (The compote can be made up to a day ahead and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before serving.) Cut off just the very edges of the Brie wheel to make a rough square (it is OK if some rind remains at the corners), then cut into 30 cubes. Put a cube in each phyllo cup, and put the cups on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Top each cup with some of the compote, and garnish with a dusting of pepper. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59770,&quot;Roasted Caprese Bites 12 Campari tomatoes 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 12 small fresh basil leaves, chopped<br> 12 mozzarella ciliegine, dried well<br> 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Using a small serrated knife, cut off the top eighth of each tomato and hollow out the insides, leaving the sides intact. (Discard the seeds and insides.) Slice a small sliver off each tomato bottom so it sits flat. Drain well on paper towel, taking care to dry the inside. Sprinkle the tomatoes with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stuff each tomato with a pinch of the chopped basil and a mozzarella ball and set on a small rimmed baking sheet. Combine the breadcrumbs with the olive oil, oregano and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Divide the mixture among the tops of the tomatoes. Bake until golden and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 59771,&quot;Easy Corn Tamales 7 cups fresh corn kernels, from 7 ears 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 egg 1/2 tablespoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup harina de maiz (dried corn flour) * 20 dried corn husks, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes* Instructions: Working in batches, add the corn kernels to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until pale. Add the egg, salt, and baking powder. Mix to incorporate. Add the flour and pureed corn and mix until blended and forms a loose smooth dough. Put a corn husk lengthwise in front of you with the wide side closest to you. Spread 3 tablespoons of the dough all over the bottom half (wide side) of the corn husk, leaving about a 1-inch-wide border on the left and right sides. Pick up the 2 long sides of the corn husk and bring them together. Roll both sides of the corn husks in the same direction over the filling. Repeat with remaining corn husks and dough. Arrange the tamales, seam side down, in a steamer and add 1/2-inch of water. Cover with a tight fitting lid, bring to a simmer and steam for 1 hour, adding additional water, as needed to maintain 1/2-inch of water in the pan. Remove the tamales from the steamer to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59772,&quot;Hot Apple Cider Donut Mocktail 2 1/2 cups apple cider 1/4 cup maple syrup Pinch ground nutmeg 2 dashes orange flavored bitters 2 cinnamon sticks 2 cloves 1/2 vanilla bean pod, seeds scraped from pod 1/2 mandarin orange 4 apple cider donut holes, for garnish Dried apple slices for garnish, optional 2 ounces vanilla vodka or whipped cream vodka, optional Instructions: Combine the cider, maple syrup, nutmeg, orange bitters, cinnamon sticks, cloves, vanilla bean and seeds and the orange half in a medium saucepot.

For the caramel, combine the sugar, maple syrup, and 1/3 cup water in a small, deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring to a boil, swirling the pan (don&#39;t stir!) to dissolve the sugar. Cook at a low boil without stirring for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture turns a golden brown and registers 230 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Watch it carefully so it doesn&#39;t burn! Off the heat, swirl in the fleur de sel, and immediately pour into an 8-by-2-inch round cake pan (not a springform!). Set aside to cool for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, canned pumpkin, and mascarpone in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-low speed until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, vanilla, maple extract, orange zest, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Gently pour the pumpkin mixture into the pan with the caramel so they don&#39;t combine. Place the pan in a roasting pan large enough to hold the cake pan flat and fill the roasting pan with enough of the hottest tap water to come halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Bake in the center of the oven for 70 to 75 minutes, until the custard is just set. It will be firm but still jiggle slightly in the middle; a knife inserted into the center of the flan will come out clean. Remove the flan from the water bath, place on a cooling rack, and cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Don&#39;t tilt the pan or the caramel will run out! Run a small knife around the edge of the flan. Turn a flat serving plate with a slight lip over the cake pan and flip them, turning the flan out onto the plate. The caramel should run out over the flan. Cut into wedges and serve with the caramel spooned over each slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 59774,&quot;Roasted Red Pepper and Sundried Tomato Soup 1-ounce sundried tomatoes (about 8 pieces do not use the oil packed type) 1 small onion, diced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups chicken stock 3 sweet or bell red peppers, charred, skinned, and seeded (see page I45), or a 6ounce Jar of prepared roasted sweet peppers 2 fresh ripe plum tomatoes, cut into eighths Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 4 fresh basil leaves, for garnish (use purple basil if available) Instructions: Rehydrate the dried tomatoes by soaking them in warm water for hour. Sweat the onion in the olive oil in a 2quart saucepan over medium heat, uncovered, for 7 to I0 minutes, stirring occasionally. Do not let the onion color. Add the stock, rehydrated tomatoes, roasted peppers, fresh tomatoes, salt, and pepper and let it all simmer together for 10 minutes. Pour the soup into a blender and process at high speed for 4 minutes, until very smooth. Then pass it through a strainer to remove the vegetable skills. Adjust the seasoning and serve with fresh basil leaves as a garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 59775,&quot;Spicy Rum Chicken Wings 3/4 cup dark rum 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving 3 tablespoons soy sauce 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar 5 large cloves garlic, minced 3 scallions, finely chopped, plus more for topping 1 to 2 habanero cl peppers, seeded and minced 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 12 jumbo chicken wings, split at the joints, tips removed Instructions: Make the marinade: Combine the rum, lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, scallions, habaneros, ginger, allspice, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Place the wings in a resealable plastic bag and add the marinade. Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly, then turn the bag over to completely coat the wings. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, turning the bag once or twice. Drain the wings, reserving the marinade. Bring the marinade to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal grill by placing coals on half of the grill. Light the charcoal and wait for the embers to become white. (Add your favorite wood or wood chips at this point.) Replace the grate and put the wings on the cooler side of the grill. Cover with the lid and cook until the juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the wings from the grill and toss with the reduced marinade. Place the wings on the grill over direct heat and cook, turning frequently, until the sauce has caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes. Top with chopped scallions and serve with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Shiraz, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 59776,&quot;Tomato Butter Dill Sauce 2 tablespoons butter 4 plum tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped 2 tablespoons minced dill fronds Instructions: Heat butter until golden, saute tomatoes just to warm; add dill off heat, season with salt and pepper.

F. Arrange two racks evenly spaced in the oven. For the bchamel, pour the milk into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk the flour into the butter and cook for 2 minutes, whisking almost constantly. Whisk in the hot milk, switch to a wooden spoon and simmer, stirring constantly, for 2 to 5 minutes, until thick enough to leave a trail when you run your finger down the back of a spoon. Cook for one more minute. Off the heat, stir in the ricotta, egg yolks, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium (10- to 11-inch) saut pan, add the pancetta and cook over medium heat for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until half-cooked. Transfer the pancetta to a plate lined with paper towels and set aside. Flip over two sheet pans and put 12-by-18-inch pieces of parchment paper on each pan. Roll and stretch 2 of the pizza doughs into a 9- or 10-inch circle (they don\\u2019t want to be perfect!) on the parchment papers. Leaving a 1-inch border, spread 1/2 cup of the bchamel on each pizza and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, 2 tablespoons of the Pecorino and a quarter of the pancetta. In a medium bowl, toss the Brussels sprouts with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle the two pizzas evenly with half of the Brussels sprouts. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned, including the bottom. Cut each pizza into 6 wedges with a large chef\\u2019s knife and serve hot.

Stir well to combine then cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Begin preparing the espresso panna cotta by placing the heavy cream, ground espresso beans, sugar and orange peel in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat and steep for 6 to 8 minutes. Add the powdered gelatin and using a whisk stir over low heat to warm the mixture and dissolve the gelatin. Do not let it simmer. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve (this not only removes the peel and espresso beans, but also any undissolved gelatin) then pour into individual espresso cups. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Once you put these in the refrigerator you can finish preparing the cocoa whipped cream (alternatively, you can do it just before you serve the panna cotta). Whip the cocoa cream until it begins to thicken and then add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Whip until soft peaks form and serve a spoonful over each of the panna cotta servings. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 59780,&quot;Poached Pears With Parmigiano 3 Bosc pears, peeled, cored and quartered Half-bottle ice wine 2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar 2 Tbsp. honey 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half 2 whole cloves 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter 8 oz. parmigiano-reggiano cheese Instructions: In a large saucepot, combine ice wine, balsamic vinegar, honey, cinnamon and cloves.

Sprinkle the chops generously with salt. Set up a standard breading procedure: In 3 large dishes, set up one with the flour, one with 2 eggs beaten with 2 tablespoons water and one with the breadcrumbs. Dust each chop in the flour and shake off the excess. Dip each chop in the egg mixture and then run through the breadcrumbs. Place the breaded veal on a sheet tray and let them hang out in the fridge for at least 1 hour to allow the breading to set. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Add enough oil to coat a large saute pan until it is a depth of 1/4-inch. Add 2 tablespoons butter and bring the pan to a medium heat. Working in batches, fry the veal chops until they are golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes total. Drain each chop on paper towels and salt each one as they come out of the oil. After the second chop, change out the oil and butter and fry the 2 remaining chops. Reserve the cooked chops in the warm oven. Coat a nonstick saute pan lightly with oil and fry the remaining 4 eggs sunny side up. The whites should be cooked and the yolks should be warm and runny, cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Top each chop with a sunny side up egg and pour over some of the Anchovy Caper Sauce. Serve immediately. Wine Pairing Suggestion: Gruner Veltliner In a small saute pan, add the olive oil, anchovy filets and garlic. Set the pan over medium heat and allow the garlic to brown lightly and the anchovy fillets to melt. Once the garlic is golden, it has fulfilled its garlic destiny; remove it and discard.

Slice off the top one-third of the bread with a serrated knife. Hollow out the loaf by cutting a circle around the inside of the bread, leaving a 1-inch border. Pull the soft bread out with your hands, making sure to leave about 1 inch intact at the bottom of the bowl as well. Tear some of the soft insides into large rustic croutons (you\\u2019ll have about 1 1/2 cups). Reserve the remaining top and bread pieces for another use (such as breadcrumbs).<br> Place the bread bowl and croutons on a baking sheet.

Let stand 8 hours or overnight (if the water becomes completely absorbed before soaking time has ended, add more hot spring water to cover). Drain and reserve the soaking liquid. Add enough fresh room-temperature spring water to the reserved soaking liquid to measure 6 cups total. Reserve. Combine the starter, rye berries and reserved 6 cups water in a 6-quart bowl. Break up the starter well with a wooden spoon and stir until it loosens and the mixture is slightly frothy. Add 1 cup (5 1/2 ounces) of the rye flour and all the cracked rye. Stir well until combined. Add the salt and remaining flour. Stir until combined and the mixture is wet and sticky. Take the dough&#39;s temperature -- the ideal is 78 degrees. Cover with a clean damp towel and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees) draft-free place. Note: If the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees put it in a cooler than 78 degree place, like the refrigerator, until the dough cools to 78 degrees. If it is lower than 78 degrees, put it in a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms to 78 degrees. The point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its fermentation. If you have to move the dough, be gentle and don&#39;t jostle it, or the dough might deflate. The dough will become spongy but not springy, distinctly sour-smelling and increased in volume by about 1/4. Generously grease 2 (5 by 9 by 3-inch) loaf pans with vegetable shortening and dust with rye flour. Turn the dough into the prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a wet thin flexible cake spatula. Cover the loaves with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) draft free place until the dough has domed slightly and increased in volume again by 1/4. Bake on center rack of a preheated 300 degree oven until the loaves have shrunk from the sides of the pan and the tops are dark brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove the loaves from the pans and hold the loaves upside down. Strike the bottoms firmly with your finger. If the sound is hollow, the breads are done. If it doesn&#39;t sound hollow, bake 15 minutes longer. Cool the pans for 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely on wire racks. Let the bread rest 24 to 36 hours before eating. It is very moist in the center when removed from oven, but as it cools the moisture distributes evenly throughout the bread. It will keep for weeks at room temperature wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 59791,&quot;Shrimp-Pineapple Skewers 1/2 cup thick teriyaki sauce 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 dash kosher salt<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 green onions, sliced<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 1 fresh pineapple 2 pounds jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined<br> 1 pound bacon, package sliced in half Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Set a roasting rack in a large baking pan. To make the marinade, pour the teriyaki sauce in a bowl and then throw in the ginger, sugar, crushed red pepper, salt, garlic, green onions and lemon juice. Stir it around and set it aside. Next, cut the pineapple into chunks by lopping off the top, slicing off the rind, cutting the pineapple into wedges, slicing off the hard inner core and then cutting the slices into chunks. Store half the chunks in the fridge for snacking. Place a chunk of pineapple on top of a shrimp and then wrap the whole thing in one of the half-slices of bacon. Stick a skewer through the whole thing so that it holds the pineapple, shrimp and bacon securely, and lay it on the rack in the pan. Continue with the remaining ingredients. Brush each skewer generously with some of the marinade. Roast the skewers for 10 minutes. Remove them from the oven and brush with a second coat of marinade. Return the pan to the oven and roast until the bacon is sizzling and the shrimp is cooked, about 15 minutes. Serve them hot or at room temperature. Divine! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59792,&quot;Spiced Apple Pie 8 apples, such as Gala (about 2 1/4 pounds) Juice of 1 lemon 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch 2 teaspoons Warm Spice Blend, recipe follows 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons boiled cider syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cubed 6 tablespoons ice water, plus more if needed 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar All-purpose flour, for dusting 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed 1 large egg, lightly beaten 4 1/2 teaspoons turbinado sugar 1 teaspoon flaky salt Whipped cream, for serving 1 tablespoon ground cardamom 1 tablespoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg Instructions: For the filling: Cut the apples into 1/4-inch slices and place them in a large bowl. Toss with the lemon juice to keep them from browning. Add the brown sugar, cornstarch, Warm Spice Blend, kosher salt and cinnamon and toss to combine. Mix in the boiled cider syrup and vanilla. Cover the mixture and let it sit at room temperature while you make the pie dough. For the pie dough: Add the flour, granulated sugar and kosher salt to a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse to incorporate so that about three-quarters of the mixture is mealy and the rest has some slightly larger, pea-sized bits of butter. Combine the ice water and cider vinegar in a measuring cup. Drizzle the water and vinegar into the food processor and continue to pulse just until the mixture comes together to form a dough. If it seems dry or is having a hard time coming together, add a bit more water, a few drops at a time, until it comes together. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and use your hands to press on any stray crumbs. Divide the dough in half, then divide one of the halves in half again so that you have 3 pieces of dough. Pat each piece into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until ready to roll out for the pie. For the assembly: Flour a work surface and roll out the largest disc of dough into a circle just larger than 12 inches. Place it in a 9-inch pie plate and refrigerate. Roll out the 2 remaining dough discs to about 10 inches each. Cut the dough into 2-inch-wide strips for making a lattice top. Set the strips aside. Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven (with a pizza stone if you have one) and preheat to 400 degrees F. Fill the pie crust with the apples (it will seem like a lot but they bake down!) and pour the juices over it. Distribute the butter over the top. Weave the dough strips together over and under to form a lattice crust over the top. Pinch the edges to seal, trim, fold the edges over and crimp. Give the edges a little hug to make sure they are sitting snugly on the rim of the pie plate; otherwise they could fall off in the oven. Freeze the pie for 15 minutes. Brush the lattice with the egg wash, then sprinkle with the turbinado sugar and flaky salt. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake until the internal temperature reaches 195 degrees F, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool slightly. Serve the pie with large dollops of whipped cream. Layer the cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg in a medium glass jar and tighten the lid. Shake to combine. Keep on hand to add to your favorite desserts and beverages -- or just toast with butter! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59793,&quot;Pomegranate Elderflower Champagne Cocktail 1 ounce St Germain Elderflower Liqueur 1 ounce pomegranate juice<br> 3 ounces champagne or sparkling wine<br> Instructions: In a champagne glass, combine the elderflower liqueur and pomegranate juice.

Once preheated, adjust the temperature to medium high for direct grilling. Soak all 6 ears of corn in water to cover for 10 minutes. Remove the corn from the water and pat dry with paper towels. Brush the shucked corn on all sides with the olive oil and leave the other corn in the husk. Grill all the corn, turning occasionally, until the shucked corn is well browned and charred in places and the husks of the unshucked corn are dried out and charred in places, about 10 minutes. Remove all the corn from the grill and let rest until easy to handle, about 5 minutes. When you can handle the corn comfortably, shuck the unshucked cobs. Then, stand a cob on its flat end on a cutting board. Holding the cob steady, take a sharp knife and carefully cut the kernels off, sliding the knife down the cob from top to bottom. Rotate the cob, cutting off a section at a time. I usually do 5 turns per cob. Repeat with the remaining corn. Discard the cobs, transfer the kernels to a bowl, and mix with the melted butter. In a separate bowl, stir the mayonnaise, minced cilantro, lime zest and juice, garlic, cl powder, and a pinch of salt and pepper together until well mixed. Stir in the cheese and toss the buttered corn with the dressing. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Garnish with a little more grated cheese. Serve warm or cold; either way, reserve topping with the bacon crumbles until just before serving, or they will get limp. Garnish with the cilantro sprig and the lime wedges, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 59795,&quot;Flank Steak With Balsamic Barbecue Sauce 1 1/2 cups balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 small onion, coarsely chopped 1 large clove garlic, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon ancho cl powder 1 1/2 teaspoons paprika 2 teaspoons dijon mustard 1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 small chipotle cl in adobo sauce, chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons packed dark brown sugar 2 teaspoons honey 2 teaspoons molasses Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 pounds flank steak 1 French baguette, halved lengthwise and cut into 4-inch pieces Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup grated monterey jack cheese Sliced scallions, for serving Instructions: Make the sauce: Bring the balsamic vinegar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until reduced by about half, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add the onion and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the ketchup and 3 tablespoons water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Add the reduced balsamic vinegar, the cl powder, paprika, mustard, red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle cl, brown sugar, honey and molasses. Simmer until thickened, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender or transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce into a bowl and let cool to room temperature. (The sauce will keep for 1 week refrigerated in a sealed container. If it gets too thick, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons water.) Let the steak sit 30 minutes at room temperature before grilling. Meanwhile, preheat a grill to high. Brush the steak with the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Grill over direct heat until browned on one side, about 3 minutes, then turn over and grill until the other side is browned, about 3 more minutes. Move to a cooler part of the grill, away from direct heat. Baste with the sauce and continue grilling, turning several more times, until medium rare, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and loosely tent with foil. Let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the cheesy bread: Brush the cut side of each piece of bread with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill on both sides. Remove from the grill and top each piece with a mound of grated monterey jack cheese. Put the bread on a piece of aluminum foil and return to the grill to melt the cheese.

On a floured table, press the disc, evening the circle as you go, until it is about 6 inches in diameter. Flour the surface of the dough and roll in into a circle measuring about 1 1/2 inches bigger than the 9-inch tart mold. Flour as much as you need to prevent the dough from sticking. Brush off any excess flour, fold the dough in half and center it over the mold. Press along the bottom edge and side to even it. Press any excess dough from the bottom edge up the sides so that they are thicker. Cut off any excess dough with a rolling pin and press the sides up so it extends about 1/8-inch above the rim. Dock the bottom with a fork and freeze. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake the frozen tart shell until the center barely begins to color, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely. Lower oven to 350 degrees. Combine the nuts and confectioner&#39;s sugar in a food processor and process to a fine powder, about 30 seconds. In the bowl of a standing mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the nut powder and mix thoroughly, scraping down the bowl once or twice. Add the egg in three parts, beating after each addition on medium high speed, until very light and fluffy. Add the almond and vanilla extracts. On low speed, mix in the flour just until incorporated. Spread the jam on the bottom of the prebaked shell and then spread evenly with the frangipane. Slice the pears in half and core. Cut each half in very thin slices from blossom to stem, leaving them attached at the stem end. Cut off the end pieces and cut each half in quarters. Fan out each quarter and arrange the 6 fans in a circle over the frangipane, stems to the center. Be sure to leave some space between the fans so the filling can rise up around them. Brush the pears lightly with melted butter. Bake about 50 to 55 minutes, until the top is golden brown and crusty. If the rim is getting too dark, cover the edge with foil or pie guards. Cool in the mold on a rack; remove the outer ring after 10 minutes. Slip a flexible metal palate knife between the tart and the metal bottom and slide off the tart. Cool completely on a rack before serving.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Heat a medium nonstick or well seasoned cast iron skillet over medium to medium-low heat. With a sharp knife or box grater, slice the potatoes as thinly as possible. Pat the potato slices dry on a kitchen towel. Start to arrange 1 layer of overlapping potato slices over the bottom of the pan in concentric circles. Pour the clear liquid of the butter over the sliced potatoes, leaving the milky solids on the bottom of the saucepan. Repeat 2 more times, making 3 layers. Drizzle each layer with a bit of the butter and season the layers, alternating salt, pepper, and then nutmeg. Cook on low heat until potatoes are golden on the bottom and crisp around the outside, about 25 to 30 minutes. Shake the pan back and forth several times while cooking to keep from sticking. Pour off any excess butter into a small bowl and reserve. Place a flat pan lid, the diameter of the skillet, over the potatoes. Holding the lid firmly in place, gently flip over. Add the reserved butter to the pan and slide the potatoes back in. Put the skillet in the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Shake the pan back and forth several times while cooking to keep the potatoes from sticking. The bottom should be browned and crisp and the potatoes cooked through.

Since this lime will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set this aside briefly, until it cools just enough to handle. Blend the allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, thyme, onions, scallions, pepper - together in a blender or food processor to make a pulp. Return to the lime and squeeze the juice into the blender through the feed tube. Reserve lime skins. Add the soy sauce through the feed tube and mix well. Season chicken pieces with jerk seasoning and place them along with the lime skins in a container which you will be able to cover tightly. Pour the marinade over the chicken and rest in the refrigerator overnight (or a minimum of 4 hours). Keep tightly covered and away from other foods, as it will taint them. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Transfer the marinated chicken to a roasting pan and pour oil over the chicken. Roast covered for about 25 minutes, removing the cover and increasing the temperature to 400 degrees F for the last 5 to 10 minutes or so. When the chicken is done, the flesh will feel firm and the juices will run clear. You can also use an instant-read thermometer which should register an internal temperature of 170 degrees F. The chicken can also be cooked on the grill. Heat grill to medium-high heat. Wrap chicken in a foil pouch in which you have shaken 1 tablespoon flour, and cook over indirect heat (on the side of the grill opposite the direct heat source) for about 15 to 20 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the aioli. Add peaches, mayonnaise, and cilantro to a food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper, to taste. Assemble sandwiches by placing sauce on roll, then chicken and top with shredded Cheddar and a sprig of cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 59814,&quot;Country Fried Steak 2 pounds boneless round steak Salt Pepper Spices (what ever you have available) Beef tallow or grease 1 quart buttermilk 1 cup flour Instructions: Cut steaks 3/4-inch thick. Pound the steaks with meat tenderizing hammer until about 1/4-inch thick. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and rub on other spices if you have them. Start heating beef tallow or grease in Dutch oven. Be sure you have enough grease in the pan to cover the steaks (at least 1-inch.) Put the buttermilk in bowl and put the flour on a plate. Wet the steaks in buttermilk and then drag through flour making sure both sides have flour on them. If a thicker crust is wanted, then repeat this procedure again. When grease just begins to smoke, then you are ready to drop in a steak and cook. Cook steak until golden brown on both sides turning steak in grease, if needed. Repeat until all steaks are cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 59815,&quot;Mini-Meatloaves 3 teaspoons olive oil 1 1/2 chopped onion 3 garlic cloves, minced 2 large eggs 1/2 cup milk 2 teaspoons Dijon Mustard 1 teaspoon hot sauce 1 teaspoon fresh marjoram 1 teaspoon fresh thyme 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 pound twice-ground chuck 1/2 pound twice-ground veal 1/2 pound twice-ground pork 1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves 1/2 cup ketchup 4 tablespoons light brown sugar 4 teaspoons cider vinegar Instructions: In a skillet heat the oil.

Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, and line the bottom of each with a round piece of parchment. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda onto a piece of parchment or into a large bowl. Beat the butter, brown sugar, peanut butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until the mixture is light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low, and add the flour mixture in 3 additions and the milk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the flour. Beat until just combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for a few minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely. Invert each onto a cooling rack, and remove the parchment. (The cakes can be stored at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 1 day.) For the filling: Spread the coconut out on a baking sheet, and bake at 350 degrees F until golden and toasted, about 8 minutes. Put the chocolate and butter in a medium bowl, microwave for 1 minute, stir until smooth and pour into a large bowl. Add the cocoa powder, vanilla and salt, and mix with an electric mixer on low speed until combined. Continue to mix on low speed, adding the sugar a cup at a time and alternating with additions of the milk. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high, and mix until smooth. (If not being used immediately, the filling can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days; let it come to room temperature and mix on medium-high until smooth.) To assemble: Slice each cake in half, for a total of 4 rounds. Spread the peanut butter on 3 of the rounds, dividing evenly. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of toasted coconut on each of the 3 rounds. Put 1 round, peanut butter-and-coconut-side up, on a cake stand or serving platter, and spread about 1/2 cup of the chocolate filling on top, leaving about a 1/2-inch border all around. Repeat with 2 more layers of cake and filling. Place the last cake round (without the peanut butter and coconut) on top. For the frosting: Put the remaining 1 1/2 cups of the filling in a large bowl, add the cream and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until medium peaks form. Frost the cake and sprinkle the top with the remaining toasted coconut. Refrigerate the cake until it sets up (this makes it possible to cut neat slices), at least 4 hours up to overnight. Serve chilled or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 59818,&quot;Cookie Dough Pops 2/3 cup butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup applesauce<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 cups almond flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup mini chocolate chips<br> Crushed cereal, sprinkles and chopped peanuts, for garnish (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: With an electric mixer or by hand, beat the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, applesauce and vanilla in a bowl.

Add the remaining vanilla bean seeds in a mixing bowl, and add the eggs and half and half. Add the remaining mace and cinnamon and beat the mixture together. Soak the brioche slices in the egg mixture and allow them to absorb the flavor. Soaking time will depend on the freshness of the brioche; the softer it is, the shorter the soaking (sometimes 1 minute is sufficient). Keep covered in the refrigerator until ready to complete the dish. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Remove the foie gras from the marinade and cut the slices about 1/4-inch to 1/3-inch thick. Reserve on a chilled plate and discard almost all of the marinade. Remove the brioche from the egg wash and lay the slices on a plate.

Fill the pot with water to cover the beans by 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil, reduce to a simmer (BTB, RTS), and cook for about 1 hour. Do the 5-bean test: Bite into 5 beans; if they are all properly cooked, carry on. If not, cook the beans for another 10 to 15 minutes and try again. Remember, beans cook at different rates, so you need to check a few to make sure they&#39;re really done! When the beans are cooked, turn off the heat and season the water generously with salt. TASTE the water to be sure it is adequately seasoned. Let the beans sit in the salty water for 15 to 20 minutes to absorb some of the salty flavor. Remove the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme bundle and discard. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water, strain the beans, and set aside. For the stew: You can start this part while the beans are cooking: Coat a large wide pot with olive oil, toss in the onions, and season with salt and the crushed red pepper. Bring the pan to medium heat and cook until the onions are soft and very aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Toss in the diced squash, cumin, fennel, tomatoes, and the reserved bean water (if you forgot to save the bean water, tap water is fine). Stir to combine, taste, and season with salt if needed. Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to a simmer (BTB, RTS). Cook for 25 to 30 minutes or until the squash is cooked through. Add another cup of water if the liquid has evaporated too much. Toss in the reserved chickpeas and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the mixture is thick and stewlike.

In a large saucepan over a medium-high flame heat the ale to a simmer. In a mortar and pestle bruise the peppercorns and allspice and add to simmering ale. Add the salt and stir to dissolve, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the bay leaves and simmer some more. Shut off heat and continue to stir, adding the water to cool slightly. Arrange the turkey pieces in a large plastic or glass, (non-reactive), bowl and pour the cooled brine over the meat. Turn the meat once to completely coat with brine, cover and refrigerate for 12 hours. Turn the meat over once after 6 hours in the brine. I use a large converted oil drum BBQ with a chimney vent. For a kettle BBQ you should use a smaller turkey. Make a pile of charcoal on the left side of the BBQ, nearest the bottom vent and arrange the grill racks on the opposite side. Insert the metal probe for the digital thermometer so that it is suspended over the area where the meat will be smoking. Place a large heavy-duty aluminum hotel pan filled with water directly under the grill racks. Light the coals and get them plenty hot. Meantime, put the wood chunks on to soak, along with the rosemary sprigs. When the coals are good and white spread them out flat, rearranging any black coals on top of the white ones. Add about 1/2 of the wood chunks to the coals being careful not to put the fire out! Place the rosemary sprigs on top of the wood chunks. Blow on the coals to get the smoke going, close the lid and open up the flue and chimney vent. When the temperature inside of the BBQ reaches 200 degrees F, open the top and arrange the turkey pieces on the grill rack. Close the top and start the smoking process. Do not open the top unless absolutely necessary for at least 45 minutes. Add more fresh coals and the other half of the wood after 45 minutes of smoking. Turn the turkey pieces over to get smoked on both sides. You should only have to smoke the turkey about 45 to 55 minutes more. Use an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness. About 155 to 160 degrees F for the breasts, and 145 to 150 degrees F for all the other pieces should do the trick. Remove the turkey to a cutting board and tent with heavy duty foil for 10 minutes before carving. Serve with a homemade cranberry sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59853,&quot;Shortcut Dan-Dan Noodles Three 3-ounce packages instant ramen noodles, flavor packets discarded 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 pound ground pork<br> 1 tablespoon grated peeled ginger<br> 6 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 1/3 cup chopped bread and butter pickles, plus 6 tablespoons brine 2 tablespoons hot sesame oil Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla and almond extracts. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in half of the flour mixture, then the buttermilk, then the remaining flour mixture until smooth. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds of the way. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes are lightly browned and spring back when gently pressed, about 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, cook the peaches: Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the peaches and granulated sugar; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the peaches start softening, 2 to 3 minutes. Cover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the peaches are soft but still hold their shape, about 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Make the frosting: Beat the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until fluffy, 2 to 3 more minutes. Add the milk and vanilla and almond extracts and beat until smooth. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip; pipe onto the cupcakes. Refrigerate until the frosting is firm, 20 to 30 minutes.

Place a large piece of parchment paper on a cutting board. Pop open the biscuit container and pull apart the dough. Lay the pieces on the lined cutting board and set aside. In a small bowl, using a fork, mix together the sugar and cinnamon, set aside. In another small bowl, using a fork, whisk the egg yolk with a 1/2 teaspoon of water, set side. Using a leaf shaped cookie cutter, punch out leaves. Using a pastry brush, brush the leaves liberally with the egg wash. Sprinkle on the cinnamon sugar. Arrange the leaves close together in a circular pattern with the tips of the leaves facing out on a pizza pan lined with parchment paper. Place the wreath onto middle level of the oven for 17 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large pot on medium heat, melt the butter. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the marshmallows, constantly stirring to avoid scorching. Once the mixture is melted, turn down the heat to low to keep it \\pliable. Pour in the green food coloring. Combine until you see a rich and even green color throughout. Gently fold in the corn flakes. Place a kitchen towel on a flat surface or counter, remove the wreath from the oven and place it on the towel. This will help you to prevent scorching your surfaces.

Spray the spoon with nonstick spray so that the sugar doesn&#39;t stick to the end of the spoon as you work. Stir the nuts, coating them with the sugar. Use the spoon to scoop out the hazelnuts and spread them on to the lined baking sheet. Spread them as best you can without creating big clumps. Sprinkle with a touch of salt. Set aside to cool.<br> In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, almond extract and the lemon zest. Set aside.<br> In another bowl, sift together the 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, flour, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon. Set aside.<br> Stir the flour into the egg mixture. Use your hands to finish combining the wet and dry ingredients. Break apart and roughly chop the hazelnuts and gently work half of them into the dough. Reserve remaining half for snacking.<br> Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and lightly spray with cooking spray.<br> Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Using your hands, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured flat surface. Form each half of the dough into a loaf-like shape about 2 inches wide and about 12 inches long. They should look like 2 loaves of bread. Carefully arrange the 2 loaves, side by side, on the baking sheet. For optimum baking, leave as much space as possible between the loaves.<br> Put the baking sheet in the center of the oven and bake, undisturbed, for 25 to 30 minutes. The dough should be light brown and may rise a little as it cooks. Remove from the oven and put onto a flat surface to cool. Turn the oven off.<br> Once cooled, using a serrated knife, gently saw the loaf into 1/2-inch thick slices, cut on an angle. Arrange the slices on the baking sheet, cut sides up, in a single layer. There should be a little space between each slice. It will almost feel like the loaves are 2 puzzles that you take apart by cutting and then put back together on the baking sheet.<br> Return the baking sheet to the oven. Allow them to sit in the oven for 10 minutes. This will cause the biscotti to firm up and toast, but only ever so slightly. Remove from the oven and cool. Serve with lemon curd. In a large, stainless steel pot, whisk together the eggs, granulated sugar, lemon zest and orange zest. Continue to whisk until the mixture lightens in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the lemon juice and orange juice.<br> Put the pot over low heat and cook and stir constantly, until the mixture starts to thicken. Take care to scrape the sides of the pot so the curd doesnt form a crust on the edges or scorch as it cooks. After a few minutes, start gradually whisking in the slices of butter. When all of the butter is integrated, remove the pot from the heat. Transfer the curd to another bowl to cool, then cover it tightly with a layer of plastic wrap. The plastic should be placed directly on top of the curd to prevent a skin from forming as it cools.<br> Serve in a bowl alongside the biscotti for dunking or spreading on the biscotti like jam.<br> Yield: about 1 to 1 1/2 cups curd<br> Prep Time: 10 minutes<br> Cook Time: 10 minutes<br> Inactive Prep Time: 30 minutes<br> Ease of preparation: easy &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 59876,&quot;\\Everything\\ Savory Potato Waffles with Smoked Salmon 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted 2 teaspoons poppy seeds<br> 1 teaspoon dried minced garlic<br> 1 teaspoon dried minced onion<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 medium russet potatoes, peeled 3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 2 scallions, chopped<br> 8 ounces smoked salmon 1/2 cup creme fraiche<br> 1 tablespoon capers<br> 1/4 cup small dill sprigs Instructions: For the \\everything\\ seasoning: In a small bowl, stir together the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried garlic, dried onion and salt.

If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. For the chicken and vegetable base: Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over direct heat. Melt the butter. Add the carrots, onions and thyme. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, coating the vegetables, and continue to cook for another minute. Whisk in the chicken stock, smoothing out any flour lumps. Simmer until the mixture begins to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dumplings: Melt the butter with the jalapeno if using and lime juice in a sauce pot over indirect heat, then let cool. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, celery seeds, salt and lime zest in a large bowl. Mix in the cheese. Slowly pour the melted butter mixture into the cold cream in a small bowl and mix together using a fork. (The butter will bead up as you mix.)

Lay the duck bones out on a sheet tray. Put the tray on the middle rack in the oven. Roast the bones until they are a deep golden brown, about 1 hour. Drain any fat from the tray and put the bones in a stockpot. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for about 3 hours. Skim off any fat that accumulates at the top with a ladle while it is simmering. After 3 hours, strain the stock.

Cover with water by 1-inch and cover with ice. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 325 degrees F. Be sure not to fill the oil beyond the maximum fill line. Drain ice water from cut fries and wrap potato pieces in a clean dishcloth or tea towel and thoroughly pat dry. Add fries, a handful at a time, to the hot oil. Fry, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are soft and limp and begin to turn a blond color, about 6 to 8 minutes. Use the basket to carefully remove fries from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels. Let rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 hours. When ready to serve the French fries, reheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Transfer the blanched potatoes to the hot oil and fry again, stirring frequently, until golden brown and puffed, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel lined platter and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59929,&quot;Sweet and Purple Potato Hash 1 medium purple potato (about 8 ounces) 1 medium sweet potato (about 8 ounces) Kosher salt 4 strips bacon, sliced into lardons 1/2 small onion, finely diced 1 clove garlic , minced 1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves removed and finely chopped 1 rib celery, finely diced 1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced Freshly ground black pepper 4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves removed and chopped Instructions: Put the purple and sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan with cold water to cover, salt the water generously and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are just fork tender, about 6 minutes; drain and cool. Once cool, dice the potatoes into 1/4-inch cubes. Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp. Remove from the skillet and place onto a paper-towel-lined-plate. To the bacon fat, add the diced potatoes, toss to coat and brown on all sides.

Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Add the vanilla and egg and beat to combine. Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and currants. Scoop slightly mounded tablespoons of the dough and roll into balls. Arrange about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake until the cookies are set and golden on the bottom, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 59932,&quot;Kolachky Cookies 2 sticks margarine, softened 6 ounces cream cheese, softened 2 cups flour 1 (12-ounce can) pureed fruit filling Powdered sugar, for garnish Instructions: In a large bowl blend margarine and cream cheese together, by hand with a metal spoon. Slowly add flour until it is all incorporated and a dough is formed. The dough will be soft and sticky. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put in refrigerator overnight, or for several hours (until hard to the touch). Flour the countertop. Take a handful of dough out of bowl returning the unused portion to the refrigerator (continue this process until all mixture is used). Roll handful of dough out into an approximately 1/4-inch thickness. Take a 2 by 3-inch diamond shaped cookie cutter, and cut as many diamonds as possible (size of kolachky should be two bites, so the cutter cannot be large). Take leftover dough and roll out again, cutting more diamonds. Repeat until all the dough is used. Place the diamond cut out onto the palm of hand. Put a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of fruit filling (apricot or strawberry or raspberry or prune flavors) into the center of the diamond shape. Dip your finger in a little bit of water, put on one side of diamond. Fold lengthwise and seal the tops of the kolachky together to create a 3-dimensional diamond shape. Place on cookie sheets and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 to12 minutes. DO NOT USE Super heat cookie sheets or any of the new non-stick coated cookie sheets. They will bake too quickly and burn the bottoms of the kolachky before you realize it. YOU MUST USE ANY KIND OF CHEAP COOKIE SHEETS usually bought at a grocery store. Cover the cookie sheet with foil or parchment paper. Do not grease the foil. Look at your kolachky every few minutes, while baking, as ovens vary in heat distribution. The later batches may cook faster than the first ones. Check the BOTTOMS of the kolachkys. They are done when the BOTTOMS are soft golden brown. The tops may not look done, but they ARE! Remove from oven, wait 3 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack. When ready to serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 59933,&quot;Peach and Tomato Salad with Sweet Southern Dressing, Pecans and Farmer&#39;s Cheese 1/2 cup canola oil 1/4 cup cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon celery salt<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 pint small heirloom tomatoes, halved<br> 4 peaches, sliced into wedges<br> 4 assorted large heirloom tomatoes, sliced into wedges<br> 1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced 1 bunch watercress, woody stems removed<br> 8 ounces farmer&#39;s cheese, crumbled<br> 1/2 cup pecans, toasted and chopped<br> Instructions: Put the oil, vinegar, honey, mustard, celery salt and salt and pepper to taste in a mason jar and shake well to combine.

Add the cheese and pecans and toss again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvdre)]&quot; 59934,&quot;Potato Gnocchi with Pesto 4 large waxy-style potatoes (about 2 1/2 pounds), peeled and cut into sixths 1-1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 large egg yolks 1/2 teaspoon fine salt Generous pinch freshly ground nutmeg Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 Basil Pesto recipe (about 1/3 cup), recipe follows 2 cups loosely packed basil leaves, washed and dried thoroughly 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a medium saucepan, place the potatoes and cover with cold salted water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered, until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Using a ricer, rice the potatoes onto a parchment-lined baking sheet in an even layer (don&#39;t pile the riced potatoes into mounds). Set aside to cool. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and, using a rubber spatula, gently mix in the flour, yolks, salt, nutmeg, and pepper until just combined and a soft dough is formed. Don&#39;t over mix the dough or the gnocchi will be unpleasantly dense. On a well-floured work surface, turn out the potato dough, and divide into 6 equal parts. With the palms of both hands gently roll each part into a \\rope\\ 3/4-inch in diameter. Using a sharp knife cut each \\rope\\ on an angle into 3/4-inch-long pieces. Shape the gnocchi: Hold a salad fork in one hand so it rests on the work surface at a 45-degree angle with the tines curving up. Place a piece of the dough at the top of the tines and hold it in place with your free thumb. In one gentle motion, quickly press and roll the dough along the tines. The gnocchi should have a small dent in one side and shallow grooves on the other, perfectly suited for holding a sauce. Repeat with the remaining pieces and transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet pan. Store in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours before cooking. When ready to serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a medium skillet, over medium-high, heat the heavy cream until just hot. Remove from the heat and whisk in the pesto. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the pesto mixture into a large bowl. Set aside in a warm spot. Add half the gnocchi to the boiling water and cook for 1 1/2 minutes or until they rise to the top. (Take care not to overcook the gnocchi or they can disintegrate during cooking.) Using a slotted spoon or strainer, transfer the gnocchi to the bowl with the pesto and toss. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi. If the sauce seems too \\tight, add some of the cooking water a tablespoon at time until a saucy consistency is reached. Season with pepper to taste. Divide among warm bowls and serve immediately. In a food processor, combine the basil, pine nuts, Parmesan, garlic, and salt and puree. While the motor is running, drizzle in the oil until incorporated. Season with pepper to taste. Use immediately or store in the refrigerator with a piece of plastic wrap placed right on the surface of the pesto to prevent discoloration, for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.

Add the rice, stir to coat in the oil, and toast for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups water, the coconut milk and salt and stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered, until the liquid reduces to the level of the rice. Cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. After 15 minutes, stir the rice, re-cover and set the pot off the heat for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and add the cilantro and scallions. For the jerk sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger, Scotch bonnet and scallions and cook until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add the allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, bay leaf and some salt and toast it all for about 15 seconds. Stir in the chicken stock, brown sugar, soy sauce, thyme and lime zest. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Finish with the lime juice and half of the cilantro. Pour half of the jerk sauce into a small bowl for serving and set aside. Reserve the remaining sauce for brushing during grilling. For the lobster: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Spoon the reserved jerk sauce over the flesh side of the lobster tails and place them on the grill flesh-side down. Grill until nicely charred, 5 minutes. Flip, then spoon more jerk sauce over the lobster meat, and grill 5 minutes more or until cooked through and the meat is starting to pull away from the shell. This is a great family-style plate. Line a platter with the coconut rice and arrange the grilled lobster tails on top. Smear each tail with some of the butter and pour over the remaining jerk sauce.

It is always best to have a bowl of cold water available in which you can immerse your hands should you get any sugar on you. This will stop the sugar from burning. As always, it is a good idea to take a class from a professional on working with sugar. This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. For the cooked sugar: Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a clean pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Open the 5 pound bag of sugar and pour most of it into a deep flat casserole dish. Pour the cooked sugar onto the granulated sugar. Leave some gaps. Sprinkle more granulated sugar on top of the cooked sugar. Use a wooden skewer to mix in some color paste. Do not try to make the color uniform. The end result will be more interesting if the color is not uniform. Sprinkle more sugar on top. It is a good idea to wear gloves to protect your fingers from the heat of the cooked sugar. Use your fingers to move the granulated sugar around the cooked sugar. As it cools, the cooked sugar will harden. Keep an eye on it so it does not become too hard. You want to be able to mold it into the shape you want while it is still pliable. This takes some time. I made a free form shape that had a 90 degree angle.<br> For the sugar flowers: Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Divide the cooked sugar between 2 heatproof large measuring cups. If you want to color the sugar with food colors, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of red color to one container and green color to the other. Mix each with a wooden skewer.<br> Use an offset spatula dipped in the red sugar to spread some sugar onto a silpat baking mat. Make 3- inch long smudges that taper off at one end, these will be the petals. You will need 5 petals to make 1 flower, so if you want more than one flower you will need to make the appropriate number of petals. Repeat the process with the green sugar. This time, use the offset spatula to fan the edges of the petals to resemble the texture of leaves. Have a flexible silicone muffin mold (or a metal muffin tin lined with parchment paper) on the work surface. When the sugar petals have cooled but are still pliable, set the petals inside the cavity of the mold. Dip each petal end into a little of the cooked sugar so you can \\glue\\ the petals together. The depth of the mold cavity will help give the flower a three-dimensional look. Repeat this process with other flower petals to make more flowers.<br> When you have the centerpiece base formed into the shape you would like, allow it to cool completely. Use more cooked sugar (which can be reheated in the microwave if necessary) to \\glue\\ the sugar flowers onto the base. Add the leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59941,&quot;Cedar Plank\\u2013Grilled Brie with Berries 1/2 cup blackberries 1/3 cup diced strawberries 1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, plus leaves for garnish Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 8-ounce wheel brie cheese 2 tablespoons roasted salted almonds, roughly chopped Crackers, for serving Instructions: Put a cedar grilling plank in a large baking dish or on a rimmed baking sheet and cover with water; let soak at least 1 hour. Preheat a grill to medium to medium high. Put the blackberries in a medium bowl and lightly crush with a fork. Add the strawberries, vinegar, sugar, thyme, a big pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Stir, then let stand at least 5 minutes. Drain the cedar plank. Trim just the top rind off the brie. Place the brie on the plank and top with the berry mixture, reserving some of the juices for serving. Sprinkle with the almonds. Place the plank on the grill and cover. Cook until the brie is softened and warmed through, 9 to 11 minutes (keep an eye out during the last few minutes in case the brie starts to melt out of the rind). Gently press the side of the brie to see if it\\u2019s ready; it should yield to pressure. Drizzle with the reserved berry juices and sprinkle with a few thyme leaves.

Use an 8 by 8 silicon baking pan or line a similar sized metal or glass baking dish with foil or parchment paper so it hangs over the edges by about 1 inch. Spray the prepared pan completely. Put the butter, oil and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat at 75 percent power for 2 minutes. Stir, and microwave again until completely melted, about 2 minutes more. (Alternatively put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, not touching, the water, and stir occasionally until melted and smooth.) Stir the brown and white sugars, vanilla and salt into the chocolate mixture with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs and coffee and beat vigorously until fully incorporated and the batter is thick and glossy. Add the cocoa, flour and baking soda and stir just until it disappears. Pour the batter into the pan and bake until the top is crispy and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out with a few crumbs, about 30 minutes (40 minutes if not using silicon). Cool the brownies in the pan on the counter. Lift brownies out of the pan by the foil, if needed. Peel off the foil and cut into 2-inch squares. Serve. Store extra brownies in a tightly sealed container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 59950,&quot;Huevos con Setas (Wild Mushroom Omelet) 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley 1/4 bunch epazote 1 large tomato, seeded and diced 1/8 cup, plus 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons butter 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1/4 bunch thyme 1/2 pound wild mushrooms: Morels, Shiitake, Oyster, wiped clean 3 extralarge eggs 1 tablespoon milk Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the parsley, epazote, tomato and 1/8 cup olive oil to make a salsa. Set aside. Heat the remaining olive oil and butter in a non stick omelet pan. Add the garlic, mushrooms and thyme and saute over medium heat until soft. If they give off juice, turn up the heat until it boils away. Preheat the broiler. Beat the eggs, milk and salt and pepper together in a small bowl. When the mushrooms are done, pour the egg mixture into the pan. Stir until it starts to scramble; stop and push down the sides with a spatula so uncooked egg hits the pan&#39;s surface. When the eggs begin to set, remove the pan from stove and place under the broiler until eggs are no longer runny. (If your pan isn&#39;t entirely heatproof, cover the handle with aluminum foil.) Remove the pan from broiler and slide the omelet onto a plate, folding it in half as you go. Cut in two and top each half with a spoonful of the salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 59951,&quot;Grilled Orange Polenta topped with Crabmeat Salad and Herb Oil 4 cups water 2 oranges, zested and juiced 1 tablespoon salt, plus more for seasoning Fresh ground black pepper 2 cups instant polenta 1 pound lump crabmeat, picked through 4 figs, diced 1 lemon, zested and juiced 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1/2 bunch chives, roughly chopped 1/2 bunch basil leaves 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing 1 cup mixed greens Instructions: In a heavy saucepan add water, zest, orange juice and salt. Bring to a boil and gradually whisk in the polenta. Cook polenta over moderately low heat (it should barely boil), stirring constantly, until very thick and it pulls from the sides of the pan about 3 minutes. Once cooked evenly pour polenta onto a lightly greased 1/4 sheet pan. Sprinkle with fresh black pepper, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until firm about 15 minutes. In a mixing bowl add the crabmeat, diced figs, zest and juice of a lemon and mayonnaise. Gently mix trying to leave crabmeat in lumps. Season with salt and fresh black pepper, to taste. Cover bowl and place in refrigerator until ready to use. In a blender place the chives and basil and a little of the oil. Start to blitz the ingredients together adding more oil until the mixture is a smooth green herb oil. Transfer to a squeeze bottle or a bowl and set aside. Preheat grill to medium-high. Remove polenta from refrigerator. Take a large can (3-inches in diameter) and remove the top and bottom lid. Using the can cut 4 rounds of polenta. Brush olive oil on both sides and place on grill 3 minutes per side. Once grilled place a polenta round on the center of a plate and use the same can for molding the crabmeat salad. Place the can over the polenta and spoon in about 1 to 2 tablespoons of the crabmeat mixture, push the mixture down with the back of the spoon and lift the can away creating a crabmeat mold on top of the polenta. Top with a few mixed green leaves.

In a clean glass bowl, use an electric hand beater (or, alternatively, an electric mixer and the whisk attachment) to whip the egg whites to \\soft peaks. (Take care to assure that all of the utensils and the bowl are very clean. Greasy residue on a bowl can greatly inhibit this process. The whites will start to gain volume but still seem somewhat yielding in texture.) Beat in the cream of tartar and then start to add the 1 cup of sugar in small increments. When all of the sugar has been incorporated, whip until \\stiff peaks\\ form. The texture of the whites should be firm and they should look glossy. Use a spatula to transfer the whipped whites to the sheet tray in the form of a circle, roughly the size of the width of the trifle bowl. Put the sheet tray in the center of the oven and bake the meringue until firm and a very pale, light brown color. At this point, you can turn off the oven and leave the meringue sit in the oven until you are ready to serve the dessert. In a medium glass bowl, combine the grapefruit juice, tangerine zest, 1/4 cup of sugar and gin. Whisk to blend, then stir in the orange and tangerine sections.

Prepare an open grill for moderate direct heat cooking. In a small frying pan, saute the ground chourico or linguica in the olive oil, add wine and tomato sauce, remove from pan and let cool. When the chourico is cool, in a large bowl, combine chourico to the ground beef and form 4 patties to fit the rolls. When the fire is ready, brush the grill rack with oil. Grill the patties until done to preference, turning once, 8 to 10 minutes medium rare. During the last few minutes of cooking, place the rolls cut side down, on the outer edges of the grill until lightly toasted. Spread the orange aioli on the cut sides of the rolls. Top the bottom roll with a bed of cilantro leaves, then the burger. Top each burger with a sliced ring of fresh pineapple, then the roll top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 59971,&quot;Southern-Style Biscuits 2 cups self-rising flour, sifted, plus more for flouring work surface 1/4 cup cold coconut oil (refrigerate to solidify prior to measuring) 3/4 cup cold milk Melted butter, for brushing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> In a bowl and using your fingers, mix the flour and coconut oil together very well until the mixture feels crumbly. Add the milk and mix (but don&#39;t overmix). Knead the dough just a couple of times, then roll it out to a thickness of 1/2 inch on a floured surface. Cut into 3-inch rounds and put the rounds on a baking sheet.<br> Bake for about 3 minutes, then liberally brush the biscuits with melted butter. Bake until golden, about 12 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Viognier, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 59972,&quot;Warm Potato Salad 1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes Salt 4 eggs, hardboiled and halved 2 canned anchovy fillets, minced 1 1/2 tablespoons grainy Dijon mustard 1 clove garlic, minced 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1/2 cup canola oil 1/4 cup water Pinch of coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup baby green beans Instructions: Put the fingerling potatoes in a saucepot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and add salt, and simmer, until just fork-tender. Cook&#39;s Note: You can use the same pot of water for boiling the eggs and blanching the beans. Just watch the time. While the potatoes are cooking, make the dressing in a serving bowl, or if you have a mortar and pestle, use that. Begin with mashing the anchovy fillets into the mustard and garlic. Add the vinegar, and slowly whisk in the oil. If too thick, add a little water. Season with salt and pepper. Blanch the beans in salted boiling water, drain and plunge or chill down in a cold water bath. Drain the beans on a towel. Peel the eggs and cut in half. Drain the potatoes, and while still warm, drop them into the serving bowl with the dressing. Add the beans and eggs. Gently fold all together, and serve warm in shallow white plate or bowls. This salad is also good served at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59973,&quot;Seared Scallops with Lemon and Bacon 3 slices bacon (about 2 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 1/2 pounds sea scallops, muscle removed (see Cook&#39;s Note) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves Instructions: Heat a large skillet over medium heat and fry the bacon pieces until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Reserve the bacon fat in the skillet and transfer the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Meanwhile, arrange the scallops so they lay flat and are evenly spaced on a plate. Pat them completely dry with a paper towel. Season the scallops with salt and pepper.<br> Cook the scallops, undisturbed, over high heat until they are golden brown on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip the scallops and cook for 1 minute more. Turn off the heat, add the lemon zest and juice, parsley and reserved bacon pieces and toss to combine. Divide the scallops among 4 plates or a serving platter and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 59974,&quot;Bread Pudding with Raspberry Jam 1 loaf brioche or challah 2 cups half-and-half 2 cups heavy cream Pinch salt 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 6 eggs 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup raspberry jam Chocolate chips, as needed (optional) Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Cut the crusts off the loaf of bread and slice into 1/2-inch thick slices. Use a cookie cutter to cut out rounds of bread that will fit snugly into your ramekins. (You can make additional rounds by cutting 1/2-moons around the edges of a slice of bread, then assembling them into whole rounds later.) Place the bread rounds in a baking dish or a sheet pan with sides. Cut any scraps into small cubes and reserve for another dish. In a saucepan, heat the half-and-half, cream, salt, and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together. Whisking constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture. Strain into a large bowl to smooth the mixture and remove the vanilla bean. Pour over the bread rounds and let them soak for 15 minutes, gently turning the bread over once. Fill each ramekin with 1 soaked bread round. Spoon a tablespoon of jam into each ramekin, add some chocolate chips, if desired, then top off with a second bread round. If there is any remaining custard, pour it over the ramekins to top them off until they are almost full. Let soak in the refrigerator another 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the ramekins in a hot water bath. Bake until just set and very light golden brown on top, about 25 to 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and return to the oven for 10 more minutes to caramelize slightly. Serve warm or chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 59975,&quot;Hot Corn cl Dip 5 ears fresh corn, shucked 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) butter<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 jalapenos, seeded and diced finely<br> 1 medium onion, diced<br> 1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced<br> 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced<br> 2 cans diced green chiles<br> 1 1/2 cups grated pepper-jack cheese<br> 8 ounces cream cheese, softened.<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 3 green onions, sliced thin.<br> Tortilla chips or pita crisps, for serving Instructions: Heat a grill on medium heat. Grill the corn until lots of the kernels have color. Cut off the kernels and set aside. If serving immediately, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, jalapenos, onions and green and red bell peppers. Cook for a few minutes, until the peppers get great color on the outside. Add the chiles and stir for 30 seconds. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the pepper-jack, the cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream and green onions and stir until combined. Add the reserved corn and veggie mixture and stir to combine thoroughly. Pour into a small baking dish. Bake immediately, or cover with foil and refrigerate up to 48 hours. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup cheese over the top and bake until bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve with tortilla chips or pita crisps. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 59976,&quot;Perfect French Fries 5 pounds russet potatoes Vegetable or peanut oil, for frying Sea salt Instructions: Peel and rinse the potatoes. Then cut them into sticks by cutting the potato in 4 or 5 vertical pieces, and then cutting each piece into sticks. Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Allow them to soak, 2 to 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak overnight.) When you&#39;re ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay the potatoes on 2 baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot with paper towels to dry them. Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot to 300 degrees F. In 3 or 4 batches, cook the potatoes until soft, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. They should not be brown at this point! You just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain on new/dry paper towels. Once all the potatoes have been fried at 300 degrees F, turn up the heat until the oil reaches 400 degrees F. When the oil&#39;s hot, start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp. Remove the potatoes from the oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with sea salt and dive in! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 59977,&quot;Italian Couscous 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup brunoise carrot 1/4 cup brunoise celery 1/4 cup brunoise red pepper 2 cups chicken stock or vegetarian stock 1/2 cup Italian couscous Instructions: Heat medium stockpot, add olive oil and saute carrots, celery and red pepper until translucent.
