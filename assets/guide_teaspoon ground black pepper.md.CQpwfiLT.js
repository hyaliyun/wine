Mix on low speed until well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Store in an airtight container. For the doughnuts: In a saucepan, heat the milk until about body temperature. Add the yeast and stir until dissolved. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt and lemon zest. Add the butter to the flour mixture along with the egg yolks and milk/yeast mixture. Use the hook attachment to mix the dough together. Start on low speed for 3 to 4 minutes, then on medium speed for 10 to 15 minutes. Add up to 2 extra tablespoons milk if the dough does not come together. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray the paper lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Scale the dough into about thirty 1 1/2-ounce pieces. Roll the dough pieces into small balls and set them on the prepared baking sheet. Make sure there is enough space between the dough balls, as they will double in size when proofing. Cover with plastic wrap. The dough can be proofed and finished at this point, or frozen for later processing. If proofing right away, let the dough balls sit in a warm area such as on top of the oven or close to it, covered with the plastic wrap so they don&#39;t dry out, until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Heat 3 to 4 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. Set a wire rack over a baking sheet. In batches and using a bench scraper or flat spatula, carefully lift the doughnuts off the parchment and drop them into the oil top first. After about 2 minutes, use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to flip the doughnuts, then cook for another 2 minutes on the bottom side. Flip them again and cook until golden brown all over, about 1 more minute. Use a spider or slotted spoon to pull the doughnuts out of the oil and set onto the prepared wire rack to drain. Roll in the cl sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48747,&quot;Salad with Toasted Chickpeas and Olive Vinaigrette 1 (15 ounce) can chick peas, drained, rinsed and dried 2 hearts romaine lettuce, chopped or 5 to 6 cups chopped bagged lettuce 1/2 cup Spanish green olives with pimiento, drained 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/4 to 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it Salt and pepper Instructions: Place chick peas in a small skillet and cook over medium heat until toasty, 12 to 15 minutes.

Add the shortening and use your fingertips to pinch it into the flour mixture completely until the flour mixture looks like sand. Coat the butter in the flour mixture, then use a box grater to grate the cold butter into the flour mixture and toss until all of the pieces are coated. Cut the butter into the flour by gathering the dry mix, pinching and dropping it for 30 to 60 seconds.<br> Make a well in the center of the flour and butter mixture and add the buttermilk. Mix until the dough forms a shaggy mass and there are no dry bits of flour left. The dough should be slightly sticky.<br> Lightly coat your work surface with nonstick cooking spray, then flour. (The spray keeps the flour in place.) Transfer the dough on to the prepared work surface and dust the dough lightly with flour. Lightly coat your hands with flour and gently press the dough with the heels of your hands to form it into a flat rectangle, 1/2 inch thick. Fold the rectangle into thirds, like a letter, then repeat the same process of pressing the dough out and folding 2 more times. Lightly dust the dough as needed to prevent sticking. Place the folded dough on a sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap directly over the dough and chill for 15 minutes.<br> For the filling: Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt in a small bowl, then mix in the orange zest; set aside.<br> Dust the work surface with flour and roll out the dough into a 17-by-8-inch rectangle, 1/4 to 5/8 inch thick, with the longest end facing the edge of the counter. Brush the softened butter evenly over the dough. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the butter and then the chopped ginger. Using both hands and starting from the long end, roll the dough as tight and neat as possible. If the dough gets too soft, place the roll on a sheet pan and chill for 15 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan.<br> Using a sharp knife, slice the rolled dough into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Place them in the buttered pan. Bake until the stickies start to brown, about 20 minutes.<br> For the milk drizzle: Mix together the milk and vanilla extract in a small bowl and pour evenly over the stickies.<br> Return the pan to the oven and bake until the milk is absorbed and the tops of the stickies are golden, another 20 to 25 minutes. Place the pan on a cooling rack.<br> For the orange glaze: Combine the powdered sugar and orange juice in a small bowl and drizzle over the top of the stickies. Serve warm or at room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48773,&quot;Raspberry-Rose Cupcakes 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup sour cream 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups raspberries 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon water 2/3 cup sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon rosewater 1 cup sugar 3 large egg whites 2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature 3/4 to 1 teaspoon rosewater Coarse sugar, for decorating Instructions: Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the melted butter, sugar, sour cream, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Add the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds of the way. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes are golden and spring back when gently pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine the raspberries, 1 cup water and the sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Whisk the cornstarch, rosewater and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Add to the raspberries and continue to cook, stirring, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on the solids with a rubber spatula. Let cool, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Put the sugar and egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer; set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Whisk until the mixture is warm and the sugar dissolves, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer; beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, 6 to 8 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium-high speed, beat in the butter a few pieces at a time, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. (It?s OK if the frosting looks curdled?it will smooth out as you beat.) Once all the butter is added, continue beating until the frosting is smooth, 1 to 2 more minutes. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of the raspberry filling and the rosewater and beat until thick and smooth. With a paring knife, cut a 3/4-inch-deep slit across the top of each cupcake, nearly edge to edge; gently squeeze the sides of the cupcake so the slit opens. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the raspberry filling into each cupcake. Let stand 5 minutes, then spoon the remaining filling into the cupcakes. Spread the frosting on the cupcakes. Sprinkle with coarse sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 48774,&quot;Baked Fudge Cake 1 pound fine quality semi-sweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate 10 tablespoons butter 4 eggs, room temperature 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons instant espresso or coffee powder 1 cup chilled heavy cream, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan. Line the bottom with a round of waxed or parchment and butter the paper. In a 2 1/2 or 3-quart saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the chocolate and butter together, stirring until chocolate is about half melted. Remove the pan from the heat and stir until melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool for a few minutes. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, use a hand held or stationary electric mixer to begin beating the eggs at medium-low speed until frothy, then raise the speed to high and beat the eggs until they are light in color, thick, fluffy and about tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. Beat in the flour and espresso powder. Stir about 1/4 of the egg mixture into the chocolate to lighten it, then fold the chocolate mixture into the eggs in the mixing bowl. Spoon the batter into the pan. Bake for 17 minutes. Cool the pan on a rack for about 10 minutes, then refrigerate until just firm enough to cut, about 30 minutes. (At this point, the cake will be firm and fudgy about 1/3 of the way to the center, and softly set like a mousse in the center.) The dessert can also be refrigerated for up to 5 days and served chilled and firm throughout, or frozen up to 1 month. Serve at cool room temperature or slightly chilled. Shortly before serving, whip the cream to firm peaks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 48775,&quot;Seared Wild Striped Bass on Chive Whipped Potatoes 6 (6 to 8-ounce) wild striped bass fillets, skin on 1 tablespoon butter, room temperature Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon vegetable oil Chive Whipped Potatoes, recipe follows Truffle Vinaigrette, recipe follows Sauteed Shiitakes, recipe follows 4 potatoes, peeled and quartered 3/4 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Salt and pepper, to taste 1/4 cup chive oil, recipe follows 1/4 cup diced fresh chives 2 cups chicken stock 1/4 cup finely diced shallot 1/4 cup sherry vinegar Salt and pepper, to taste 3/4 cup truffle oil 1 cup grapeseed oil Instructions: Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F. Season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. Place a large, non-stick saute pan over very high heat. When hot, add the oil, and swirl to coat bottom of pan. Brush each fillet (skin-side only) generously with butter. Place the fish fillets into the hot pan, skin side down, and brown for 2 minutes over high heat. Place the pan in the oven for 3 minutes. Serve warm from the oven, with Chive Whipped Potatoes, Truffle Vinaigrette, and Sauteed Shiitakes. Put the potatoes in a saucepot and cover with cold water. Add salt and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes. Strain the water out of the pot and mash the potatoes with the cream, butter, salt and pepper. Stir in the chive oil and sliced chives, and serve. Chive Oil: 1 cup vegetable oil, well chilled 1 bunch fresh chives, sliced into very fine pieces Salt In a food processor, blend the oil and chives together. Season to taste with salt. Reserve the remainder in a plastic squeeze bottle, refrigerated. Place chicken stock in a saucepan and reduce liquid to 1/2 cup. Place chopped shallots in a large, stainless steel mixing bowl, pour hot stock over them, and steep for 10 minutes. Add the vinegar, season to taste, and slowly add the oils, whisking constantly to emulsify. Set aside until ready to use.

In a large mixing bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Set aside. In a medium, heavy-based saucepan, heat the brown sugar, milk, and cream over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Scald the mixture (do not boil it) and remove it from heat. While the cream mixture is heating, dissolve the sugar and water over low heat in a large, heavy-based saucepan increase the heat to high and boil the sugar until it&#39;s amber in color. If the sugar starts to sputter, use a pastry brush dipped in water to wash down the sides of the pan. As soon as the sugar turns dark amber (like an old penny), carefully and slowly pour the hot cream into it, stirring the mixture. (The caramel will bubble as you add the cream, so use a long wooden spoon or whisk to combine them.) Gently and slowly whisk the cream mixture into the egg yolks. Stir in the salt and vanilla. Strain the pudding and cool it in an ice bath or refrigerate until cool. Skim off any air bubbles from the pudding mixture and divide the cool pudding mixture among 6 (6-ounce) ramekins. Set the ramekins in a shallow roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the pan with foil. Bake the pudding until just set. Begin checking after 1 hour. When gently shaken, they should no longer look liquid; instead, the custard will move as one mass. Allow the pudding to cool to room temperature in the water. Refrigerate the pudding for several hours or overnight before serving. The pudding will keep its dark color if refrigerated uncovered. It will taste no different but will look lighter if you cover it, which you should do (after if has cooled completely) if you have any strong flavored food your refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 48777,&quot;Lemon Ginger Toddy Juice of 1/2 lemon Quarter size piece ginger 2 teaspoons honey, or to taste 3/4 cup boiling water, approximately Dark rum, optional Instructions: In a mug combine lemon juice, ginger, honey and boiling water.

Add the flour, thyme, paprika, eggs, 1 teaspoon salt and a generous grinding of pepper. Mix well to combine. Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you stick a shred of sweet potato in and it sizzles immediately. Scoop out the batter with a 1/3-cup measure and press firmly into thin patties, about 4 inches in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick. Set the patties on a parchment-lined baking sheet. You should have 8 to 10 patties. Slide as many patties as will fit comfortably into the oil. Fry the patties until cooked through and golden brown on both sides (flip carefully with a spatula and fork or spoon to help guide them without splashing the oil), 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining patties. (You can keep the first batch warm in the oven at 250 degrees F, if you like, while you cook the rest.) Season with salt while still warm. To serve, combine the sour cream and dill in a small serving bowl. Serve the warm pancakes with the dill sour cream and a dish of applesauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 48790,&quot;Fresh Basil Paste 4 cups (packed) fresh basil leaves (about 8 ounces weighed with stems on) 4 to 5 peeled cloves garlic, coarsely chopped About 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper For each 1/4 cup, add 2 tablespoons chopped pine nuts and or 2 to 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan Instructions: Rinse the basil well and pat dry.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Mix 1/4 cup of the rice vinegar with the honey and brush the ducks all over with this mixture. Place the ducks in a roasting pan and roast them about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and pour off the accumulated fat. Give the ducks a quarter turn and return to the oven. Repeat this process for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the ducks are dark golden brown on all sides. Remember to pour off the rendered fat each time you turn them. When completely cooked, transfer the ducks to another pan and let them rest so that the fat continues to drain from the insides. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, reduce the plum wine with the mint sprigs and orange peel to a glaze. Add the vinegar and reduce it by two thirds. Add the plum puree and reduce it by half, until the flavor is quite intense. Add the demi-glace and continue to reduce the mixture by half, or until it is thickened slightly and tastes delicious. Over very low heat whisk in the butter, a little at a time. Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper. Strain the sauce and keep it warm. Remove the breasts and legs from the duck. Place them on a grill or under a broiler or salamander until the skin is crispy. Slice the duck breasts into medallions. Separate the legs and thighs; arrange half a duck attractively on each plate. Sauce the duck with the plum sauce. Decorate each plate with a scallion-filled Chinois Pancake. Place the plums, wine and berries in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and simmer until the plums are soft, about 15 minutes. Puree the mixture in a blender or food processor and strain it through a fine sieve into a clean saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce to 1 cup. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt, egg and sesame oil. Whisk in the milk, then unless your batter is completely lump free, strain into another bowl. (The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream). If the batter is too thick, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you get the desired consistency. Stir in the ginger, garlic and scallion. Heat the butter in a non-stick crepe pan over moderate heat. Add 2 tablespoons batter, then swirl the pan to coat the bottom with batter. Cook the pancake over high heat until golden brown. Turn it over and brown the other side. Remove from the pan and keep warm. Repeat the process until all the batter is used. Cut each pancake in half, place a scallion on each and roll into a cone shape. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 48803,&quot;S\\u2019mores Cheesecake Bars 2 cups heavy cream 9 cups mini marshmallows Cooking spray 3 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs<br> 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/3 cup plus 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 teaspoon salt 2 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

If you can&#39;t find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.) 1 teaspoon sugar 1 envelope instant dry yeast 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons Instructions: For the pesto: Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F. Put the peppers on a baking sheet, rub them with the canola oil and season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Roast until they are slightly charred and soft, turning several times, about 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let them steam for 10 minutes. Remove the skins and seeds. Put the peppers, garlic, basil and pine nuts into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. With the motor running, slowly pour the olive oil through the feed tube and pulse to emulsify. Add the cheese and salt and pepper, to taste and pulse a few more times just to combine. Scrape the mixture into a bowl. For the pizza: Light a grill to high heat. Roll the pizza dough into 2 (12-inch) circles, brush the top with some canola oil, and season them with salt and black pepper, to taste. Put them on the grill, oiled side down, and grill until the bottoms are slightly charred and golden brown. Brush the tops with additional oil before flipping the pizzas over. Continue grilling until the crusts are just firm, about 40 seconds. Transfer the shells to a baking sheet, top each with some of the pesto, mozzarella and shaved Parmigiano and return them to the grill. Close the cover and grill until the cheese melts. Remove the pizzas from the grill and finish the pizza with some sliced red onion and handful of arugula. Slice and serve. Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball. Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour.

Once the syrup is cool, remove the ginger coins and mix into the watermelon water. Pour the mixture into a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish. Place the dish into the freezer to chill. Every 30 minutes, scrape the mixture with a fork to break up the ice crystals and to keep it light and fluffy. Continue scraping every 30 minutes for at least 2 hours.

For the crab cakes: In a large bowl, combine the crab, crackers, mayonnaise, chives, mustard, lemon zest and egg. Mix together well. Form palm-sized cakes and place them on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. In a pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and cook the crab cakes in batches, about 2 minutes on each side. Put them back on the baking tray and in the oven for 10 minutes. For the spicy mayo: Using a blender or food processor, beat the egg with the Dijon mustard and red wine vinegar. Slowly add the canola oil until the mixture starts to emulsify and becomes very creamy in texture. Add water if necessary to make a thinner texture. Add the sriracha sauce. Continue to process for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. When ready to serve, garnish the crab cakes with a dollop of spicy mayo. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48810,&quot;Cowgirl Quiche 3 cups all-purpose or pastry flour, plus more if needed for rolling 1 tablespoon chopped chives 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup cold salted butter, cut into chunks 3/4 cup cold vegetable shortening, cut into chunks 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar 1 large egg, lightly beaten 2 leeks, tops and bottoms trimmed, cut in half lengthwise 16 ounces white mushrooms, sliced<br> 2 tablespoons salted butter<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> 8 large eggs<br> 2 cups grated Swiss cheese<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon pesto<br> 8 thin slices prosciutto (or any good ham), chopped<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the chive pie crust: Mix the flour, chives and salt in a bowl. Add the butter and vegetable shortening and work them into the flour using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Using a fork, stir in the vinegar, beaten egg and 5 tablespoons cold water. Stir the mixture until just combined. Shape the dough into 2 discs. (You&#39;ll only be using 1 disc for this recipe. You can wrap the additional dough in plastic wrap for storage; it will keep up to a week in the fridge or up to 6 months in the freezer.) Have ready 2 sheets of parchment paper that are each at least 12 inches square. Place the disc of dough between them. (If the dough is sticky for any reason, don&#39;t worry. Just sprinkle some flour on the parchment to get started. You shouldn&#39;t have to add much for it to stop sticking.) Starting at the center, roll the pin out to the edge. Turn the dough and parchment as necessary and continue rolling, always from the center to the outer edge. After a couple of rolls, lift the parchment paper away from the dough to loosen and replace the parchment. Flip the whole thing and loosen the other paper sheet. Continue rolling until the dough is large enough for your pie pan. For the filling: Slice the leeks thinly, and then soak them in cold water for about 10 minutes to remove any grit or dirt. Drain well. Put the mushrooms on a large baking sheet. Roast until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, saute the leeks in the butter until golden brown and beginning to caramelize, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside. For the quiche base, add the cream and eggs to a medium bowl and whisk them to combine. Stir in the leeks, mushrooms, grated Swiss and some salt and pepper. Mix in the pesto and prosciutto. The mixture should be very thick! Pour the mixture into the pie shell, then cover loosely with a sheet of aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too brown on top. Bake for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the quiche to sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. Place the quiche on a cutting board and slice wedges with a serrated knife. Delicious for breakfast, and even better for lunch with a salad and a bunch of juicy grapes! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 48811,&quot;Ice Cream Truck-Style Strawberry Shortcake Cupcakes 1 cup shortbread cookies 1 cup freeze-dried strawberries<br> 1/2 cup puffed rice cereal<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted<br> Kosher salt<br> 24 frosted vanilla cupcakes Sliced fresh strawberries, for garnish<br> Instructions: Pulse the cookies in a food processor until sandy.

Remove the outer shell and discard. Finely grate 1 cup of fresh coconut. Thinly shave the remaining coconut into moon shaped pieces. Toast shavings lightly and set aside for garnish. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop live lobsters into a pot of boiling water and cook for only 5 minutes. Remove the lobsters from the water and plunge them into a large bowl or pot filled with iced water to stop the cooking. The lobsters should be cooked early in the day so the lobsters have time to reabsorb their wonderful juices. In a 2 quart saucepan, add the oil and butter. Remove the claws and tails from all the lobsters. Set aside. Remove the outer shell from 3 of the lobsters. Saute the 6 lobster bodies over medium high heat until a little bit colored. Leaving some of the shells on will give your sauce a pink cast. Add the shallots, cl, and lemongrass. Cook gently until tender. Deglaze the pan with white wine. Add grated coconut and ginger. Add enough cold water to barely cover the lobster bodies. Add curry paste or curry powder. Let sauce simmer slowly for 20 to 30 minutes until reduced, showing a little \\body. Add heavy cream and let sauce reduce slightly. Add lime juice and lime zest. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Finish with 2 tablespoons of butter for silkiness. Strain sauce. Take approximately 1/2 of the solids and puree in blender with some liquid. Add pureed solids back to sauce. Set aside. Remove claw meat from their shells. Split the tail, removing all the shell carefully from the tail, except the last segmet of shell connected to the actual tail flippers. Skewer the 2 segments of the tail with 1 claw and 1 piece of scallion in between. You will have 6 skewers. Beat the egg whites with the 2 tablespoons of cold water to thin out. Dip each skewer lightly into the egg white mixture. Very delicately, sprinkle water chestnut flour all over the lobster. Don&#39;t pack on too much. Bring a large pot of peanut oil to 350 degrees. Fry 2 skewers at a time. They will only take approximately 2 to 3 minutes to crisp. Remove skewers from the oil and drain. Place in barely warm oven while the other skewers cook. To serve, place finished skewers on plate with your delicate salad leaning against the lobster. Spoon the curried coconut sauce around the plate and garnish with toasted coconut \\moons.

Into the bowl of a food processor, add the flour, eggs, oil, and black pepper. Process until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Put the mixture onto your work surface and knead it lightly for a few minutes until it is smooth. It should be quite stiff. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. To make in a pasta machine: Take a quarter of the pasta and pat it into a flat rectangle with your hands. Feed it through the widest setting on the pasta machine. Fold that piece in thirds into a rectangle shape and feed it through again. After you have fed it through on the initial setting, there is no need to keep folding it, just keep feeding it through, making the setting narrower each time. If the pasta rips while using the pasta machine, don&#39;t worry, just fold it back into a rectangle and feed it through the widest setting again. A rip may mean that there is an obstruction in the pasta machine between the rollers. If that is the case, just open the machine to the widest setting and let whatever was stuck in there fall out. If the pasta sticks to the machine, just flour the machine a little to help ease the pasta through. When you have fed the pasta through on the narrowest setting, sprinkle the top with a little flour and fold it in half, short end to short end, then again, and again and again until you have a smaller rectangle. With the folded edge facing you, cut vertical strips about 1/2-inch wide along the width of the pasta, then carefully take one strip, unfold it completely and hang it on the coat hanger. Repeat with the rest of the pasta, using a quarter piece of the dough each time. To make the pasta by hand: Dust the work surface very lightly with flour. Take a quarter of the dough and put it on the work surface. Pat the dough with your hands into a flat rectangle. Lightly flour a rolling pin and roll it out until it is a very long and thin rectangle. My rectangle was 5 to 6 inches wide and very, very long. The pasta is ready when it is so thin that if you lift it up and put your hand behind it, you can see your hand through it. Sprinkle the top with a little flour and fold it in half, short end to short end, then again, and again and again until you have a smaller rectangle. With the folded edge facing you, cut vertical strips about 1/2-inch wide along the width of the pasta, then carefully take one strip, unfold it completely and hang it on the coat hanger. Repeat with the rest of the pasta, using a quarter piece of the dough each time. Once all of the pasta is hung, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta, in one or two batches depending on how big your pan is, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the pasta is just cooked through. Using a pair of tongs, remove the pasta from the pan and, drain in a colander. If cooking the pasta in batches keep the first batch warm while cooking the rest. Once all the pasta is cooked and drained, drizzle with some of the olive oil, sprinkle a few basil leaves over the top and serve immediately. This is delicious used in the Creamy Pancetta Sauce with Mushrooms and Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 48842,&quot;Double Raspberry Cream Filled Cupcakes 1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup butter, softened 1-1/4 cup sugar 2 eggs 1/4 cup milk 1 teaspoon Spice Islands?

Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. If you have a pizza stone, put that in the oven, but leave a rack empty for baking the pizza rolls.<br> Roll out 1 pound of the pizza dough 1/8-inch thick on a floured work surface. Using a pizza cutter, trim the edges to make a 12-inch square. Starting about 1 inch from the bottom, spread the pizza sauce in a thin line, from the left side to the right. Top with a sprinkling of chopped spinach and a small sprinkling of shredded mozzarella cheese. Starting from the bottom, roll the dough over the filling, and then roll one more half turn. Using a pizza cutter, slice off the completed roll, forming a long tube shape. Then slice the tube into 1 1/2-inch pieces; pinch the cut ends to seal, forming little rolls.<br> Repeat the process with the remaining rolled out dough. You should be able to make about 22 rolls total. (You can freeze any leftover dough, or make some quick breadsticks.)<br> Place the rolls about 1 1/2-inches apart on the baking sheet and brush the tops with some of the egg wash. Bake until golden brown on top, 13 to 16 minutes. (And the cheese might be seeping out on the sides, which means you&#39;ve done something right in life.)<br> While the pizza rolls bake, heat the butter and oil and in a medium skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Cut the remaining pound of pizza dough in half, and roll out each piece on a floured worked surface to make two roughly 8-to-10-inch rounds. Put the rounds on baking sheets, or use a pizza peel to build 1 pizza at a time if you are using a pizza stone.<br> Divide and spread the remaining pizza sauce evenly over both crusts. Follow with an even scattering of mushrooms, the whole spinach leaves and the remaining shredded mozzarella. Tear the bocconcini into pieces and scatter them over the tops of the pizzas. Bake both pizzas on the baking sheet or 1 at a time on the stone, until the dough is cooked through and the cheese is browned and bubbly, 13 to 17 minutes.<br> Top the pizzas with some torn prosciutto and basil leaves and good shavings of Manchego. Serve and inhale. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 48855,&quot;Rachael&#39;s Tuna Pan Bagnat 1 French baguette 1 six to eight-ounce tuna steak 1 bay leaf 5 whole peppercorns Juice of 1 lemon (See Cook&#39;s Note) 3 tablespoons capers, drained 1/4 red onion, chopped 1 can artichoke hearts in water, 15 ounces, drained, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup good quality black olives, from bulk bins in deli area of market 1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls Coarse black pepper, to your taste 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, to your taste Instructions: Crisp baguette in hot oven, then cool to handle. Cut baguette in half lengthwise, on an angle, then split each half lengthwise. Put about 1 inch of water, the bay leaf, peppercorns, and juice of 1/2 the lemon into a small skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the tuna steak, cover, and simmer until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove tuna from the water and allow to cool. Place tuna in a bowl and separate with a fork. Add capers, red onion, artichokes. For olives, if they&#39;re pitted, coarsely chop them. If the olives have pits, place an olive or 2 on your cutting board. Turn your knife sideways and place the flat of the blade on top of the olives -- just like peeling garlic -- whack the heal of your hand on knife and the pits of the olives will be exposed. Remove pits and chop. Add olives and parsley to tuna mixture. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the bowl. Squeeze lemon halves holding cut side upright, allowing juice to spill over sides. The seeds will stay with the lemon half, rather than falling into your salad. Add black pepper to the bowl and drizzle salad liberally with evoo, extra virgin olive oil. Toss tuna salad and adjust pepper and evoo to your taste. Pack the tuna salad on to baguette halves and set tops in place. Press down to set the bread and salad together. The bread will absorb the evoo and salad juices -- YUMMY! Cut each half baguette in half again, making 4 sandwiches, total. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 48856,&quot;Moroccan Burger Salad 2 6-inch pitas, split and quartered 1 pound lean ground beef sirloin 1 red onion (1/2 grated, 1/2 sliced) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the grill 2 tablespoons harissa (cl paste) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 beefsteak or heirloom tomatoes (about 1 pound), cut into 1-inch wedges 2 Persian cucumbers, sliced 1/2 inch thick 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro or mint (or a combination) 1 small heart romaine lettuce, torn 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon and sausage are nicely browned, about 10 more minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon and sausage to a plate. Drain the fat from the pot and return it to medium heat. Add the onions, a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup water. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the brown bits from the bottom and sides of the pot, then sprinkle the onions with 1 tablespoon of the parsley and plenty of black pepper. Layer the bacon and sausage over the onions and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon parsley and more black pepper. Layer the potatoes over the meat and add enough water to submerge everything but the potatoes, about 2 cups. Season the potato layer with a pinch of salt and plenty of black pepper and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon parsley. Bring the liquid to a boil (don\\u2019t stir!), then cover and transfer to the oven. Bake, checking halfway to add more water if needed, until the onions are very tender and caramelized and the liquid has reduced slightly, about 2 hours. Finish with a pour of stout, if using, and a final garnish of the remaining parsley. Serve immediately with soda bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 48858,&quot;Pasta 3 quarts water 1 tablespoon kosher salt 16 ounces dried spaghetti noodles 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 to 3 cloves of garlic, minced fine Capers Sun dried tomatoes Red pepper Olives Walnuts Hard cheeses like Asiago and Parmesan Soft or veined cheeses like gorgonzola or chevre Canned Artichokes Smoked oysters Black pepper Instructions: Place water in large lidded pot, add salt and bring to a rolling boil.

While it&#39;s coming to temp, throw in the leek, carrot, and hunk of ginger. Place the coriander and peppercorns into a small square of cheesecloth. Tie with kitchen string and add to the pot. Skin the chicken breasts, remove any excess fat, and throw the chicken breasts into the pot. Allow the whole lot to come to a boil, and then turn it down and simmer, covered, until the chicken is cooked and tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the chicken and allow to cool. Strain the stock and discard the leeks, carrots, ginger, and cheesecloth sachet. Return the stock to medium heat. Add the creamed corn, bouillon cubes, chopped ginger, scallions, and sesame oil. Keep the soup at a gentle simmer while you remove the chicken from the bone and shred finely using a fork. (Or you can just slice it really thinly.) Turn up the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix the cornstarch with the water until smooth. Add half to the soup whilst stirring. Allow to boil until it&#39;s thickened to the soup consistency of your liking. (If it doesn&#39;t thicken, add the remaining slurry.) Turn the heat back down to medium. In another small bowl, beat the egg whites with a little water. Stir the soup in circles as you add the egg whites in a steady stream; it should form pretty white wisps on the surface of the soup. Add the shredded chicken and rice vinegar. Cook for 5 minutes, allowing everything to warm through. Taste for seasoning. Serve with a splash of soy sauce and some of the reserved scallion greens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48862,&quot;Lentil and Quinoa Soup 1 onion, cut into large chunks 3 carrots, cut into large chunks 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 teaspoons dried mint 3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds 3 plum tomatoes 1 1/4 cups dried brown lentils 1/2 cup quinoa Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 clove garlic 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/2 cup labneh (or use full-fat plain Greek yogurt) Instructions: Pulse the onion and carrots in a food processor until chopped into small pieces. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion-carrot mixture, 1 teaspoon dried mint and the cumin seeds.

Make the cake batter; divide between the pan and the bowl. Bake at 350 degrees F until a toothpick comes out clean, about 35 minutes for the pan, 40 to 45 minutes for the bowl. Let cool, then unmold the cakes onto a rack. Microwave the white chocolate at 50% power in 15-second intervals, stirring, until melted, about 2 minutes. Pour onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and spread to 1/4 inch thick with an offset spatula. Sprinkle with the sanding sugar. Chill until set, about 10 minutes. Remove the chocolate from the refrigerator. Break most of it into rough 1/2-to-1-inch pieces to form the ice that covers the igloo. Use a paring knife to cut a few even 1/2-inch tiles from the remaining chocolate (these are for the tunnel entrance). Assemble the igloo: Mix 2 1/2 cups frosting with the blue food coloring. Spread some blue frosting on the flat cake, then cover with the bowl-shaped cake. Spread some frosting on the cake where you want the tunnel to go, then attach a doughnut half, cut-side down. Attach the other half with frosting to extend the tunnel. Cover the entire cake with a thin layer of blue frosting (this is called a \\crumb coat,\\ which is like a primer; it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect). Chill, uncovered, until the frosting sets, about 15 minutes. Spread the remaining blue frosting evenly over the cake and doughnuts. Arrange the white-chocolate pieces on the igloo in a mosaic pattern. Place the even white- chocolate tiles around the tunnel entrance. For the trees, mix 3/4 cup vanilla frosting with the green food coloring. Spread on the cones, flicking the frosting with the tip of an offset spatula to form branches. Arrange the trees around the igloo and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 48864,&quot;Seoul-ful Ribs with Rice Canola oil 3 pounds short ribs (cut across the bone in strips), each piece 3/4-inch thick (6 pieces total) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced 1-inch piece fresh ginger, minced 1/2 cup Korean red bean paste 1/2 cup mirin 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons sambal (chili garlic sauce) 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock 3 cups long grain white rice Guy&#39;s Homemade Kimchi, for garnish, recipe follows Scallions, sliced on the bias, for garnish 1 head napa cabbage (about 3 pounds) Kosher salt 1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar 2 tablespoons sambal (chili garlic sauce) 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon peeled and grated fresh ginger Freshly cracked black pepper 1 cup julienne carrot 1 cup julienned daikon 2 scallions, cut on the bias into 1-inch-long ribbons Instructions: Set a large Dutch oven over high heat.

Set a cooling rack into a baking sheet. Halve the eggplant lengthwise and score the flesh by making three long cuts down the middle and sides, making sure not to pierce the skin. Salt the eggplant and then place it cut-side down on the prepared cooling rack for 30 minutes to release moisture. Turn the eggplant over and remove the cooling rack. Using paper towels, dry the eggplant and the baking sheet of any moisture. Cut the eggplant into 1-inch cubes and place back on the baking sheet. Scatter the garlic cloves among the eggplant. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle with the smoked paprika and some salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast until the eggplant is completely soft and browned, about 30 minutes. Let cool. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Toss the potatoes in a medium bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Place the potatoes cut-side down on the oiled baking sheet and roast until tender, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool. Scrape the cooled eggplant into the bowl of a food processor and squeeze the roasted garlic out of its peels into the food processor. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley, mint and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and puree until smooth. Add the shallot and tomato and pulse to combine. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary. To serve, scoop out a cavity in each potato half with a paring knife or small spoon. Fill with the \\eggplant caviar\\ and top with a dollop of creme fraiche and a sprinkle of black sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 48871,&quot;Zesty Napa Slaw 3 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard 1 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 head Napa cabbage, thinly sliced, about 6 cups 6 scallions (white and green parts), thinly sliced 1 orange or yellow bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and thinly sliced 1 red apple 2 cups watercress leaves Instructions: Whisk the vinegar with the mustard, salt and pepper, to taste, in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in the olive oil, starting with a few drops and then adding the rest in a steady stream to make a smooth, slightly thick dressing. Add the cabbage, scallions, and bell pepper and toss until the vegetables are coated. Serve now or cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Before serving, grate the apple (with the skin but not the seeds) directly into the slaw, add the watercress leaves, and toss again. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48872,&quot;Lamb Lollipops with Mint Salt 1 cup gray salt 1 cup fresh mint 2 racks of lamb, about 1 1/2 pounds each, frenched by the butcher Freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup dry red wine Instructions: Put the salt into a mortar and pestle. Adding a few mint leaves at a time, crush them into the salt until all the mint is used up and the salt is green and fragrant. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season the lamb with freshly ground pepper and rub them with the mint salt. In a deep-sided oven-proof skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the lamb racks, skin side down, and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the lamb over and put the pan into the oven, uncovered, for about 7 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the lamb to a board, cover with foil, and allow it to rest for 5 minutes while you make the glaze. Remove the excess fat from the skillet and add the red wine. Place the skillet over medium heat and reduce to a syrupy consistency, about 5 minutes. Slice the lamb racks between the ribs into chops and place them onto a warmed platter. Drizzle the glaze over the chops and serve as \\lollipops. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 48873,&quot;Vegetable Samosas 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 cup ghee or clarified butter or oil Cold water as needed, usually about 10 tablespoons 3 medium baking potatoes, boiled until tender, drained and cooled 1/4 cup ghee or clarified butter or oil 1 cup minced onion 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 1 hot green cl, such as Serrano, finely minced 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon garam masala 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup frozen green peas, thawed 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves 1 cup plain yogurt 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves 1 tablespoon chopped green onion 1 tablespoon lemon juice Chutney, for serving Instructions: Make the pastry by combining the flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and then rubbing 1/4 cup of the ghee into the flour until well combined and mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water, a tablespoon at a time, until the pastry comes together to form a ball, about 10 tablespoons. Knead the dough lightly and then form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 1 hour. While the dough is resting, make the filling. Peel the potatoes and cut into small dice. Heat 1/4 cup of ghee in a medium skillet and add the onion. Cook until the onion is lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes. Add the ginger, cl, coriander, garam masala, and cumin seeds and cook until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes, 1 teaspoon of the remaining salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper and cook, stirring, until well combined, about 6 minutes. Add the peas and 3 tablespoons of the cilantro and set aside to cool completely. While the filling is cooking, make the yogurt dipping sauce by combining the yogurt, remaining tablespoon of cilantro, mint, green onion, lemon juice, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and remaining 1/8 teaspoon of pepper and stir to combine. Set aside, refrigerated, until ready to serve the samosas. Divide the samosa dough into 10 portions and roll each piece of dough into a circle about 5 inches in diameter. Cut each circle in half. Lightly moisten the straight edge of each half circle and press together to seal; you should now have a cone-shaped portion of dough. Carefully spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling into the dough cone and then moisten the remaining edges with a bit of water and press together to seal. Repeat with the remaining portions of dough and filling. When you are ready to fry the samosas, heat a large saucepan filled at least 2 inches with oil to about 340 degrees F. Fry the samosas, a few at a time and stirring to promote even cooking, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. (Note: these will float to the surface of the oil long before they are ready to be removed; make certain to cook them until the pastry is crispy and golden brown.) Remove using a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper-lined plate to drain. Repeat until all samosas have been fried. Serve immediately, with the yogurt dipping sauce and your favorite chutney. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 48874,&quot;Pan-Fried Pizzas 1 cup balsamic vinegar All-purpose flour, for dusting 1/2 pound (8 ounces) prepared pizza dough, at room temperature 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for drizzling 6 sprigs fresh thyme 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup whole-milk ricotta 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus additional for garnish 2 large cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup tightly-packed fresh basil leaves, chiffonade Pizzeria Salt, recipe follows 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Instructions: Make the balsamic glaze: In a small saucepan, bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until reduced by two-thirds and syrupy, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside to let cool. Shape the crust: On a flat, lightly-floured surface, divide the dough into quarters. Roll each into a loose ball. Cover with a kitchen towel and allow the dough to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Working with one ball at a time, roll and gently stretch into an 8-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. (Note: You can also use a rolling pin, if easier.) Set aside, covering with the towel or plastic wrap. Cook the crusts: Heat 4 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the sprigs of thyme. Let cook until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the thyme sprigs to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside to cool, then pick the leaves off the stems. Reserve the leaves. Increase the heat to medium. Working with one round of dough at a time, gently place the dough into the hot oil so that it lies flat in the skillet. Cook until the underside is browned and the edges are crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Use a pair of kitchen tongs or a heatproof spatula to flip the dough to the other side, taking care, as the oil is hot and can splatter. Cook until the crust looks crispy, another 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the crust to a sheet pan fitted with a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining dough, adding and heating more oil in the skillet as needed between batches. Prepare the tomatoes: In a medium bowl, toss the tomatoes with some salt and pepper and set aside. Make the ricotta mixture: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, garlic, fried thyme leaves and salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasonings. Assemble the pizzas: Transfer the crusts to a cutting board. Use the back of a kitchen spoon to spread the ricotta mixture evenly among the 4 pizzas. Drizzle with oil. Sprinkle the basil and Pizzeria Salt over the ricotta. Drizzle with the balsamic glaze. Top with the tomatoes. Cut each pizza into slices with a pizza cutter or saw into pieces gently with a serrated knife. Serve immediately with another drizzle of balsamic and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan and Pizzeria Salt. In a medium bowl, combine the Parmesan, garlic powder, oregano and red pepper flakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 48875,&quot;Grilled French Toast with Apple-Berry Compote and Apple-Mascarpone Cream 2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 8 ounces mascarpone<br> 4 cups apple cider 1/3 cup sugar<br> 1 cup sliced strawberries<br> 1/2 cup blackberries<br> 1/2 cup blueberries 2 eggs 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/3 cup milk<br> 6 slices brioche or challah 4 tablespoons butter, melted Instructions: For the apple-mascarpone cream: Combine the apples, sugar, cinnamon and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples are completely tender, about 12 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring, until reduced to the consistency of applesauce, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool completely. Once cool, combine 1/2 cup of the applesauce with the mascarpone; mix to blend. Refrigerate until ready to serve. (Reserve extra applesauce for another use.) For the apple-berry compote: Combine the apple cider and sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until syrupy, about 10 minutes. Cool until warm. Add the strawberries, blackberries and blueberries to the syrup. Keep warm until ready to serve. (This makes more compote than you&#39;ll need, but it&#39;s a delicious topping for ice cream!) For the French toast: Preheat a grill pan to medium low. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, sugar, vanilla and cinnamon. Then whisk in the milk. Brush the hot grill pan with butter to coat. Dip 3 brioche slices into the egg mixture; flip and dip on the reverse side. Remove from the egg mixture, letting any excess fall back into the bowl. Immediately add the bread to the grill pan. Cook until crisp and grill marks appear, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, 3 minutes more. Remove to a plate and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 3 brioche slices. To serve, add 3 slices of French toast to each plate.

Cooked uncovered, stirring frequently, for 1 hour 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec]&quot; 48888,&quot;Ham and Cheese Buns 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one 1/4-ounce package)<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the bowl and plastic wrap<br> 1 large egg yolk<br> 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus 2 tablespoons, at room temperature, for the pan<br> 1 medium leek, white and light greens chopped (about 1 cup)<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 pound sliced ham (about 4 slices), cut into 1/4-inch pieces Instructions: For the dough: Warm the milk and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan over low heat until it is about 100 degrees F (but no more than 110 degrees). Remove the saucepan from the heat, and sprinkle the yeast over the liquid. Sprinkle a pinch of the sugar over the top, and set aside without stirring until foamy, about 5 minutes. Then whisk in the butter and egg yolk. Whisk together the flour, remaining sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon until you&#39;ve made a thick, slightly sticky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Put the dough ball in the buttered bowl, turning to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, trace a circle the size of the dough ball on the plastic and note the time. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl, and knead briefly to release excess air; re-form the dough into a ball, and return it to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap, and lay it on the dough. Cover the entire bowl tightly with the rest of the plastic, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to let the dough proof. For the filling: Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and just beginning to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the leeks with the flour, and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned and toasted, about 1 minute. Whisk in the wine and 1/4 cup water, and let the mixture thicken, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the Gruyere, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer the filling to a medium bowl, and let cool completely. (The filling will firm up a bit, but if it&#39;s too warm, it will be difficult to form the rolls.) For the rolls: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with the 2 tablespoons softened butter. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and press it flat. Roll it into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle, with 1 long edge facing you. Spread the cooled filling evenly over the dough, leaving about a 1-inch border on the side opposite you. Sprinkle the ham over the filling. Starting from the side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight roll. Lightly brush the 1-inch border with water, and continue rolling to seal the roll. Fold the ends in just a bit, and if any spots look thicker than others, even out the roll with your hands. Cut the roll every 1 1/2 inches with a serrated knife, to make 12 pinwheel slices. Place the slices flat in the prepared pan (put the end pieces cut-side up), spacing them 1 inch apart. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap. Set in a warm place to rise until the slices double in size with no gaps in between, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the buns until they&#39;re golden brown and the tops spring back when pressed lightly, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 48889,&quot;Dagwood Sandwich 4 french rolls 1/4 pound prosciutto ham, sliced thin 1/4 pound mortadella, sliced thin 1/4 pound salami, sliced thin 2 balls fresh mozzarella, sliced 1/2 pound provolone, sliced 1 log fresh goat cheese, sliced Oil and vinegar Dried oregano Salt and pepper 4 whole plum tomatoes, sliced 2 yellow onions, thinly sliced Instructions: Slice open French buns and assemble the sandwich of your dreams.

Store at room temperature for up 6 months. Cover the potatoes with cold water in a large pot. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Add the peas to the same water and cook until bright green and tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, remove the potatoes to a plate to cool and transfer the peas to the bowl of a food processor.<br> For the filling: Add the ginger, sugar, 1 green chili, 1/2 cup cilantro, juice from half the lime, 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the peas in the food processor and process in spurts until a rather coarse paste. Adjust with salt to taste. Remove half the paste for the filling (about 1/2 cup). Then make the chutney for serving: Add 2 tablespoons water, the remaining chilies, cilantro and lime juice to the food processor and pulse until it has the consistency of a fine pesto. Adjust seasoning with lime juice and salt to taste. Set aside.<br> When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the peels and transfer to a large bowl. Mash the potatoes. (I find it easier to coarsely grate the potatoes on a box grater and then mash.) There shouldn&#39;t be any large pieces but it shouldn&#39;t to be super smooth either. Add 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, 1 1/2 teaspoons chaat masala and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well and adjust seasoning to taste with salt.<br> Divide the potato mixture into approximately 12 equal-sized pieces (about 1/4 cup each). Rub a little bit of oil on cleaned and dried hands (it helps forming the patties) and roll into balls and then make an indentation in the center with your thumb. Spoon about 1/2 tablespoon of the reserved pea mixture into the indent and gently close the edges together to seal. Roll into a ball again and flatten into a patty about 1/2-inch-thick. (If a little pea mixture gets mixed with the potato part of the patty do not worry.) Repeat with rest of the balls and filling. If you have filling left, you can add it to the chutney.<br> Add the remaining breadcrumbs on a plate or shallow bowl. Press both sides of each patty into the breadcrumbs to coat.<br> Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the patties in single layer batch, evenly spaced out. Fry until you get a nice golden crust, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Wipe out the skillet with a couple paper towels. Repeat with more oil and the remaining patties. Serve hot with chutney.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 48891,&quot;Kellogg&#39;sand#174; Eggoand#174; Waffles with Caramelized Bananas and Greek Yogurt 4 Kellogg&#39;s?

For the cilantro-lime cream: In a bowl, combine the sour cream, honey, lime juice, cilantro, coriander, cumin, salt and pepper and whisk together. Refrigerate until using. For the braised chicken: Heat a saute pan over high heat. Sprinkle the chicken with the kosher salt and pepper. Add the grapeseed oil to the pan and sear the chicken on both sides until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Do not overcrowd the pan; sear the chicken in batches if needed. Remove the chicken from the pan and hold in an oven-safe casserole dish for further cooking. Add the onions and peppers to the saute pan and cook until tender. Add the paprika, smoked paprika and chipotle peppers and saute with the peppers and onions for 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and ketchup, stir and bring to a simmer. Pour the braising liquid over the chicken and cover the casserole dish with foil. Cook in the oven until the chicken is tender and falls apart, 45 minutes. While the chicken is still hot, shred it and return it to the braising liquid. If you are using it right away, keep the chicken hot in the braising liquid for plating. (If you are refrigerating the chicken to use later, cool it down and store it in the braising liquid. Reheat it as needed for plating.) For the guacamole: Cut the avocados in half and remove the pits. With a spoon, scoop out the avocado flesh into a bowl. Add the red onions, tomatoes and cilantro and mash the ingredients together. Season with salt and lime juice. Divide the lettuce among the taco shells. Spoon about 2 ounces of the braised chicken into each shell.

Reserve half the mixture in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator to serve with crackers or another use. Put aside the remaining mixture while you prepare the dough. For the snacks: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside. Brush the phyllo with butter. Halve the piece lengthwise, then cut each piece crosswise into thirds. You will have 6 pieces total. Place a slice of ham at the short end of a piece of phyllo. Spoon one-sixth of the remaining pimento cheese down the side of the ham closest to the phyllo. Fold in the excess phyllo along the long edges and then roll the the phyllo into a cigar, starting at the end with the ham and pimento cheese. Brush the phyllo with butter as you roll. Place the phyllo cigars a few inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the water, oil and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and using a wooden spoon or a Danish whisk, stir the mixture until a shaggy dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until the dough is a bit smoother. Then \\slap\\ the dough and turn it over and knead it until smooth; this could take between 5 to 10 minutes. You can also mix the dough in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. This takes about 10 minutes. Cover the dough in plastic wrap and allow to rest a room temperature for 2 hours. Cover a table (at least 36 inches square) with a clean tablecloth. Sprinkle the cloth all over with flour. Gently press the dough into a rough 12-by-12-inch square and then gently pull the dough into a large square, about 36 inches. Use a pair of clean kitchen scissors to cut the thicker edges off the perimeter and discard them. Allow the dough to rest to dry out just a bit, about 5 minutes.

Add eggs and about 1/2 cup of water. The amount of water will vary according to the weather. You want to make a stiff dough. Divide it into 3 equal portions and knead until silky smooth. Fillings: We usually make cheese and kapusta (sauerkraut), but you can use meat, potatoes, or even fruit. Saute onion in butter until just soft. Add kapusta and brown. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow time for the filling to cool before assembling pierogi, otherwise they will fall apart when cooked. If making more than one filling, this one can cool while you prepare the others. Mix well. To assemble and cook pierogi: Roll out a portion (or half portion, if space is limited) of the dough on a floured surface as thinly as possible -- somewhere between a wonton and a thin pizza. Put about a tablespoon of filling on the dough and use a large plastic cup (a big gulp-type cup works really well) to cut a circle around the filling. Dampen half of the circumference of the circle with a bit of water on your finger and fold into a dumpling. Boil the dumplings a dozen at a time in a big pot of salted water until they float -- no more than 3 minutes. At this point you can freeze them in bags for later use. To prepare for serving, brown the pierogi in a skillet using a bit of butter. If you want to be really traditional you can use bacon grease. Alternately, you can bake them in a casserole, spraying both the casserole and the pierogi with a butter flavored spray, and putting a few pats of butter on top of the dumplings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48922,&quot;Shiso Oil 1 cup shiso leaves 1/2 cup spinach leaves 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 2 cups canola oil Instructions: In a pot of boiling, well salted water, blanch shiso and spinach for 30 seconds and shock in ice bath.

Turn off the mixer and fold in the chocolate chunks using the spatula. To form the cookies, scoop about 1/4 cup of cookie dough into your hands and roll it around into a ball; place them about 3-inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets; you should get about 4 cookies on each pan. Press down the tops of the dough slightly and bake until the cookies are light brown, 12 minutes for chewy cookies, or about 15 minutes for crispy cookies.

Spray two 8-inch cake pans with baking spray and line the bottoms with parchment rounds. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to medium low; beat in half the flour mixture, then all of the milk and then the remaining flour mixture until just combined. Separate the batter into 6 different bowls and tint one bowl red, one orange, one yellow, one green, one blue and one purple. Transfer each color to a separate disposable pastry bag or resealable ziptop bag. Pipe half of the red batter into the center of one of the prepared pans, then pipe the remaining red batter into the center of the second pan. Pipe half the orange batter into the center of the red batter in the first pan, then repeat with the remaining orange batter in the second pan, tapping the pans gently as needed to level out the batter. Repeat with the remaining colored batter until all the batter is piped and both cake pans are about half full. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer the pans to a rack and let cool 10 minutes, then invert the cakes onto a wire rack and cool completely. To decorate: Using a serrated knife, level the top of each cake layer. Spread a small amount of Buttercream Frosting onto an 8-inch cake board. Place one cake layer onto the cake board bottom-side up. Add about 1/2 cup of frosting to the top of the cake and smooth to an even layer. Invert the second cake layer over top of the frosting layer. Using an offset spatula, frost the cake with an even coat of frosting. Refrigerate to set and chill, about 3 hours. Place the chilled cake onto a wire rack fitted inside a baking sheet. When the Mirror Glaze is the proper temperature, pour the colors together into a single container for a swirled effect. Pour the glaze over the cake, then let it stand to set before transferring to a cake stand.<br> Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth. Adjust the consistency with milk as desired. Whisk together the gelatin and 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl; set aside to bloom. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is clear, about 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the bloomed gelatin to dissolve. Add the white chocolate and let stand 1 minute to melt. Add the condensed milk and combine with an immersion blender until emulsified and smooth. Divide the glaze into bowls and color as desired. When the glaze is between 75 and 80 degrees F, it is ready to pour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48929,&quot;Grilled Pizza with Prosciutto, Ricotta and Arugula 1 lemon 8 ounces ricotta, at room temperature Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound frozen pizza dough, thawed All-purpose flour, for sprinkling 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates 6 ounces prosciutto 2 cups baby arugula (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Finely grate the zest of the lemon; cut the lemon in half and reserve. Stir together the ricotta, lemon zest, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Set aside. Divide the pizza dough into 2 balls. Sprinkle the flour on a clean flat surface and roll each ball into an oval about 14 inches long, 6 or 7 inches across and between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick. Transfer the crusts to the prepared baking sheet. Brush both sides of each crust with olive oil, about 1 tablespoon per side, and lightly sprinkle with salt. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the crusts until they start to puff and distinct grill marks appear, about 1 minute. Flip and cook until just cooked through, an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Discard the used parchment paper and put the finished crusts on the baking sheet. Immediately top each crust evenly with prosciutto. Place small dollops of the ricotta mixture over the prosciutto. Toss the arugula in a bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the juice of one of the lemon halves (reserve the other half for another use). Season with salt and pepper. Divide the arugula between the pizzas and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 48930,&quot;Cellophane Noodle Salad 4 ounces (100 grams) cellophane noodles A good glug olive oil 8 ounces (200 grams) minced pork A large pinch five-spice 3 cloves garlic, crushed 2 teaspoon sugar A handful prawns or shrimp, any size you like, peeled and deveined Handful plain and skinned peanuts, roughly crushed 1 bunch spring onions, finely sliced 1 bunch coriander, chopped 1 bunch mint, chopped 2 thumbs fresh ginger, grated 2 red chiles, finely sliced with seeds 2 limes, juiced 1 tablespoon soy sauce Olive oil Instructions: Soak the noodles in boiling water and drain.

To make the dough, beat the butter by hand in a medium bowl just until it is evenly softened. Quickly beat in the melted chocolate, then the flour. Continue to mix until the dough is smooth. Scrape the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and press it into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Wrap and chill the dough until it is firm -- about an hour. While the dough is chilling, make the filling. Combine the cream, butter and corn syrup in a saucepan and bring to a boil over low heat. Remove from heat and add both chocolates. Shake the pan gently to submerge chocolate in the hot liquid. Let stand 5 minutes, then whisk smooth and scrape filling into a bowl. Let stand at room temperature or in the refrigerator until of spreading consistency. To bake the cookie bases, set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. If the dough is very hard, pound it gently with the rolling pin to soften it so that it rolls out more easily. Divide dough in half and, on a floured surface, roll one half about 1/16-inch thick. Use a fluted, round 2-inch cutter to cut the dough into cookies. Place them on prepared pans as they are cut, leaving about an inch between the cookies. Repeat with the remaining dough. Save all the scraps. Reroll the scraps and cut more cookies. Bake the cookies 12 to 15 minutes, until they are firm and slightly colored. Cool the cookies in the pans on racks. When cookies and filling have cooled, arrange half the cookies, flat side up. Place a dab of filling on them and cover with the remaining cookies, flat sides together. Dust cookies very lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar before serving &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48933,&quot;Churro Cupcakes 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup sour cream<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3 cups powdered sugar, sifted<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons whole milk<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> Neutral oil, for deep-frying 2 flour tortillas<br> Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper cupcake liners. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, sour cream, vanilla and eggs until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Turn the speed to low and add the dry ingredients. Blend until well combined, about 25 seconds. Pour 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons of batter into each cupcake liner. Bake the cupcakes until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool. For the buttercream: Using an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, vanilla and cinnamon until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed, about 2 minutes. With the machine running on low, add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, alternating with the milk, and mix until combined. Fit a pastry bag with a star tip and fill with the buttercream. For the tortilla crisps: Mix together the granulated sugar and cinnamon on a large plate. Set aside. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the pan. Heat over medium-high heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. (If you do not have a thermometer, test the oil with a piece of tortilla, which should sizzle when it touches the oil and should brown in 2 to 3 minutes.) Meanwhile, using a cookie cutter, cut the tortillas into different shapes and/or letters. Fry the tortilla pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the crisps to paper towels to drain. While still warm, transfer to the cinnamon-sugar mixture and turn to coat. To assemble the cupcakes: Pipe a swirl of buttercream on each cupcake and top with a tortilla crisp. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 48934,&quot;French Potato Salad 2 pounds red potatoes, peeled 1/4 cup white wine 1/2 cup olive oil 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, minced Salt and pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to boil, add potatoes, cook until tender, drain.

Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart, about 15 minutes. While the potatoes cook, combine the milk and 6 tablespoons of the butter together in a small saucepan and heat over medium, stirring, until the butter melts and the milk is steaming. Drain the potatoes and return to the saucepan over medium heat. Add the warm milk mixture and mash the potatoes until just slightly chunky. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, mushrooms, garlic, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until the mixture turns brick red, about 2 minutes. Add the beef and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Continue to cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon into small pieces, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce and cook until saucy, about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat. Transfer the beef mixture to a 2-quart oval casserole dish and top with the mashed potatoes. Swirl decoratively with a spoon, stopping about 1/4-inch from the edge of the dish. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and drizzle over the potatoes. Bake until the potatoes are brown and the filling is bubbly, about 40 minutes.

Line pan with foil and leave about 2 inches extra on all sides. Butter the foil. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with a hand mixer, beat the butter with the sugar on medium, until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Turn mixer to low speed, add the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not over work the dough. Transfer dough to prepared pan, spreading it out evenly across the pan and pressing to make a 1/4-inch thick covering over the bottom of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap, then press and flatten using your hands over the top to smooth and even out the dough. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Remove the plastic from the top of the dough and prick the dough with a fork or a wooden skewer. Bake the crust until just golden, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the jelly in the microwave until soft enough to spread, about 1 minute. Spread the jelly with a pastry brush or an offset spatula over the crust. Return to the oven and cook another 10 minutes. Cool crust completely on a wire rack, 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, yolks, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, flour, and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat until thick and slightly pale. Stir in the citrus juices and zest, and whisk gently to blend well. Pour the filling onto the cooled crust and bake until the filling is firm but still loose and wobbly in the center, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight before cutting. Remove pan from refrigerator and dip the bottom of it in warm water to soften the butter and release the foil from the sides of the pan. Use foil to lift pastry out of the baking dish and transfer to a cutting board. Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut into about 50 (1 1/2-inch) squares, wiping down the knife with a hot, wet towel between cuts.

Line an 8-inch square baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang on all sides. Coat the foil with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Stir together the cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons very hot water in a small bowl until smooth; let cool slightly. Stir together the milk and vinegar in another small bowl, and let stand until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk together the oil, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in the food coloring and the cocoa mixture. Alternate whisking in the flour mixture in three additions and the milk mixture in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just combined. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Once the cake is cool enough to touch, press it down slightly to make the layer even. Place the pan on a cooling rack and let cool completely. For the cheesecake: While the red velvet cake bakes, combine the gelatin with 2 tablespoons water in a small microwave-safe bowl, and set aside to soften, about 5 minutes. Heat the granulated sugar and corn syrup over medium heat in a small skillet. Cook, swirling the pan but not stirring, until the mixture turns amber, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, and carefully whisk in the cream and bourbon. (If the caramel seizes and hardens, continue to stir over medium heat until it melts and is smooth again.) Bring the mixture to a fast simmer, and cook until the caramel thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally to help the caramel cool faster. Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down the side of the bowl. Add the cooled caramel, sour cream and confectioners&#39; sugar, and beat on medium-high speed until incorporated and smooth, about 1 minute. Microwave the gelatin until melted, stirring as needed, about 30 seconds. Add it to the cream cheese mixture, and beat on medium-high speed to combine, about 30 seconds. Spread the cheesecake mixture over the red velvet cake in an even layer. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours. Make the whipped cream: Beat the cream and confectioners&#39; sugar together with an electric mixer at medium-high speed in a large bowl until medium peaks form. Spread the cream over the cheesecake. Use the foil overhang to lift the bars out of the pan. Peel down the foil, and thinly trim the edges of the bars. Cut into 12 even rectangles, wiping the knife clean between cuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 48958,&quot;Scallop Mousse 1 pound wet sea scallops, muscle removed, rinsed and patted dry 2 egg whites 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/4 cup heavy cream, very cold 35 to 40 mini phyllo shells Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the scallops into the bowl of a food processor and pulse 4 to 5 times. Add the egg whites and pulse until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemon zest and parsley. Pulse to incorporate. With the machine running, slowly add all of the cream. Scrape down the sides of the bowl 1 last time, put the lid back on and run for 5 more seconds. Place the mousse into a pastry bag or a zip top bag with the tip snipped off and pipe into mini phyllo shells. Bake for 10 minutes.

Then add the onions and cook until the bacon is cooked but not crisp and the onions are translucent, another couple of minutes. Do not drain the bacon grease because it gives the beans a good taste. Add the beans, peppers, tomatoes, garlic and 1 1/2 cups water, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Add some salt and pepper and the cilantro and remove from the heat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 48961,&quot;Grilled Sweet Potato Fries with Honey-Mustard-Mint Dipping Sauce 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup whole-grain mustard 1/4 cup honey 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 large sweet potatoes Canola oil, for brushing Instructions: Whisk together the Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard, honey and mint in a bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature while you prepare the fries. Put the sweet potatoes in a large pot, cover with water and add 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil and cook until a paring knife inserted into the center of the potatoes meets with some resistance, 10 to 15 minutes depending on size. When cool enough to handle, cut each sweet potato into 6 wedges. Heat a gas or charcoal grill to medium-high. Brush the potato wedges with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until slightly charred and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Bring the whipping cream and milk to a boil in a saucepan over low heat. The second it starts to boil, take it off the heat. Add the chocolate shavings and whisk until smooth. In another bowl, mix together the yolks, brown sugar, and cayenne. Slowly spoon the chocolate mixture into the yolks. Cook&#39;s Note: It is important to take your time with this step because the chocolate is hot, and if you dump it into the eggs in one shot you&#39;ll end up with chocolate scrambled eggs. Pour the mixture into little pots or espresso cups and cover with foil. Pierce some small holes in the foil so steam can escape and place the jars into a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with water halfway up the sides of the jars so that they bake evenly. Bake for 35 minutes.

Since these will be hot coming from the microwave, set them aside until just cool enough to handle. Season fish with salt and pepper and place in a non-reactive container for marinating. Squeeze lime juice over fish and add rinds to the bowl. Pour tequila over fillets, cover and let marinate in refrigerator for at least 2 hours. About 20 to 25 minutes before mealtime, prepare orange beurre blanc by combining orange juice and wine in a saucepan and simmering on medium heat until reduced by half the volume. Stir in heavy cream, bring to a gentle simmer, and allow to reduce and thicken over low heat. Stir in parsley and set aside briefly in a warm place. Heat oil over medium heat in a large saute pan and add butter. Sear marinated fillets flesh side first, leaving undisturbed for at least 2 to 3 minutes to allow the surface to begin to caramelize and prevent tearing of the fish. Flip over to sear the skin side. Allow to cook for 5 to 8 minutes or until flesh springs back when gently prodded. Remove to a tray and let rest. Whisk butter into sauce just before serving and spoon over and around the fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 48974,&quot;Rillettes of Salmon 1 cup mayonnaise 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Dash extra-virgin olive oil Dash Worcestershire sauce Dash hot pepper sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 1 1/2 teaspoons capers, chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons caper juice (liquid from a jar of capers) 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons fresh chives, minced 8 ounces salmon fillet, skinless, about 3/4 inch thick 1 teaspoon finely ground sea salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup cold water 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 4 ounces smoked salmon, cut into strips about 1-inch long and 1/4-inch wide Lemon zest, julienned, for garnish Instructions: In a bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, olive oil, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce, capers, caper juice, salt, and black pepper. Whisk in 2 tablespoons chives and taste for seasoning. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Will keep for 2 to 3 days refrigerated. Makes about 1 cup. Preheat an 8-inch skillet over high heat. Add the water and lemon juice, the liquid should be about 3/4 inches deep. Generously season the salmon fillet on both sides with salt and pepper. Put the salmon in skillet, and bring the water to a simmer (about 180 degrees). Reduce the heat to very low, tightly cover the pan, and poach the salmon until medium rare, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the salmon to a plate and place it in the refrigerator to cool. Remove any pin bones from the salmon and break the fish up into the mayonnaise. Add the smoked salmon and fold together. Garnish with lemon zest and remaining tablespoon of chives. Store tightly covered in the refrigerator. Serve cool but not cold. Cooking Notes: For the most luscious texture, poach the salmon on your stovetop&#39;s lowest possible setting, with the water just gently steaming the fish. Wine Notes: Chardonnay is wonderful with this dish, but please ask your wine merchant for one with little or no oak, so it does not clash with the woody flavor of the smoked salmon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 48975,&quot;Baked Squash Rings 1 medium butternut squash 1 medium acorn squash Coarse grain salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, salt and baking powder. In another large bowl using an electric mixer, beat the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the yolks and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until well combined. Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Lightly dust a piece of parchment with cocoa powder. Roll 1 piece of dough on the prepared parchment to between 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch thick. Using a 2 1/4-inch round, fluted cookie cutter, stamp out as many cookies as you can. Transfer the cookies to the prepared sheets. Roll and cut the remaining dough; you can reroll the scraps once. Chill the unbaked cookies for 10 to 15 minutes. Bake until the cookies are set and the tops look dry, 14 to 16 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through cooking. Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes. For the filling: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar and butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Add just enough milk to make a creamy filling. Beat in the mint extract.<br> When the cookies are cool, flip half of them over. Spread or pipe about 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling on the flipped cookies. Top with the other halves and press together gently. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato, Cava]&quot; 48985,&quot;Creme Caramel 1 cup turbinado sugar (using turbinado sugar for the caramel heightens the flavor) 1/3 cup water<br> 5 whole eggs 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 3 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.<br> Arrange the ramekins in a roasting pan or baking sheet.<br> Using a stainless steel pan, combine the turbinado sugar with the water, swirl to blend and heat until it forms a clear syrup. When the sugar and the water have \\melted\\ together completely, raise the heat and watch as the caramel darkens slightly, amber in color. Remove from the heat and immediately divide the caramel evenly between the 8 ramekins. Try to have all the caramel on the bottom of each ramekin and not so much on the sides. Set aside.<br> In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, granulated sugar and salt. In a medium pot, over medium heat bring the milk to a gentle simmer. Add the vanilla and pour it slowly over the egg mixture, whisking to blend. Distribute the liquid evenly between the 8 ramekins. Put at least 1 1/2 inches of water in the bottom of the roasting pan or baking sheet so it makes a \\water bath\\ for the custards as they cook. Put the roasting pan in the center of the oven and bake until they are firm in the center, 45 to 55 minutes. Allow to cool for 30 minutes and then refrigerate until serving.<br> When the custards are completely cool, run a knife around the top edge of each ramekin and turn the ramekin upside down on the plate. When you lift it, the caramel at the bottom will pour over the custard and form a delicious pool on the plate, which makes for a fun presentation. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]</p><p>&quot; 48986,&quot;Raviolo al&#39; Uovo 2 cups ricotta cheese 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano, plus more for garnish 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 2 large eggs plus 8 large egg yolks Kosher salt All-purpose flour, as needed 1/2 recipe Chef Anne&#39;s All-Purpose Pasta Dough, rolled for ravioli, recipe follows, or 1/2 pound store-bought fresh pasta sheets Semolina flour, as needed 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 cups chicken stock 1/4 cup chopped fresh sage leaves 1 pound all-purpose flour (about 3 3/4 cups), plus more for dusting 4 eggs plus 1 yolk<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parm, parsley and 2 whole eggs; mix well and season with salt. Dust a clean work surface lightly with all-purpose flour and lay out two sheets of pasta about 12 inches long; brush them lightly with water. Equally space 4 dollops of the ricotta mixture on each pasta sheet; then use a spoon to make a \\nest\\ or small hole in the center of each dollop. Carefully separate the remaining eggs (reserve the whites for another purpose) and put a yolk in each ricotta \\nest--the ricotta should lovingly nestle each yolk (if a yolk breaks, scoop it out with a spoon and don&#39;t use it). Cover the ricotta nests and egg yolk with another sheet of pasta. Use your index fingers to press around each ricotta nest to seal the edges, then use a fluted ring cutter or dough roller to cut around each ravioli (they should be 3 to 4 inches in diameter). Reserve the ravioli on a tray generously dusted with semolina. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. In a large saute pan, melt half the butter and add half of the chicken stock (you&#39;re going to use the remainder for your next batch); season with salt and toss in half the sage. Bring this to a boil (BTB) and reduce to simmer (RTS). Add 4 of the ravioli to the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully transfer the ravioli from the water to the pan with butter and chicken stock and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. If the sauce reduces too much, add a few drops of the pasta cooking water. The sauce should cling to the ravioli in a buttery hug. Transfer the ravioli to serving plates, spoon a little extra sauce over each one, and finish with a sprinkey-dink of grated Parm. Repeat with the remaining ravioli. Mound the flour on a clean, dry work surface. Make a big hole (called a well) in the center of the flour pile--bigger is definitely better here. Crack the eggs into the hole along with the extra yolk, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons water; season with salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water, and salt and begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture. Be careful not to break the well or the egg mixture will run everywhere and you&#39;ll have a big fat mess on your hands (and your board). When enough flour is incorporated that you can handle the dough, use your hands to combine everything really well. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands a bit. When the mixture is homogeneous, start kneading... To knead the dough, it&#39;s VERY important to put your body weight into it, to get on top of the dough, and really stretch it. Be careful not to tear it--the idea is that you stretch the dough, not rip it. Use the heels of your palms and roll the mixture over itself. When it&#39;s done it should be smooth, supple, and velvety and look like the head of a preemie Cabbage Patch Doll. Kneading will take anywhere from 8 to 15 minutes, depending on how experienced you are. (Don&#39;t hold back: This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and work it!) When the pasta is ready, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least an hour at room temperature before rolling. If you&#39;re making the dough ahead of time, wrap, refrigerate, and bring to room temperature before using. To roll out the pasta, you need to run the dough through the pasta roller a bunch of times to get it long and thin. To start, cut off about a quarter of the dough (remember, the bigger the piece you start with, the longer your dough is going to get), keeping the rest wrapped up so it doesn&#39;t dry out. Squish the dough to flatten it--this will help it run through the pasta roller more easily. Where do we start? We start at the beginning! Run the dough through the pasta roller starting on the widest setting, number 1. Then dust the dough with flour, fold it into thirds, and put the dough through this setting two more times. If the dough ever feels sticky or tacky, give it a little dusting of flour. Now adjust the setting to number 2 and repeat the process again--changing the setting each time until your dough is the desired thickness. Once the dough is rolled out, be sure to keep the pasta sheets covered so they don&#39;t dry out. Depending on what I want to use the pasta for, I usually stop around number 5 or 6. For long noodles, I keep it thicker, and for ravioli or stuffed pasta, I keep it thinner. All pasta machines are different, so you need to judge how your pasta machine works and adjust your rolling accordingly. Once you get the thickness you want, repeat this process with the remaining pieces of dough. &quot;,&quot;[Barbaresco, Barolo, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 48987,&quot;Homemade Spicy Turkey Sausage 2 1/2 pounds turkey meat, diced 1/2 cup chopped garlic 6 teaspoons chili powder 4 tablespoons paprika 2 teaspoons cayenne 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons onion powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Instructions: Prepare the smoker. In a large mixing bowl, add the turkey. In a small mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients together. Mix well. Toss the turkey with the seasoning blend and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. Grind the meat twice in a meat grinder fitted with a 1/2-inch die. A food processor could also be used to grind the meat.

Season the veal chops generously with salt and let them sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Rub the chops with oil on both sides and arrange on the preheated grill on a very hot spot. After about 3 to 4 minutes, when the chops have developed lovely grill marks, rotate the chops 90 degrees to create the cross-hatch pattern. Cook the chops for an additional 3 to 4 minutes on that side and then repeat the process on the other side. This will cook the chops to about medium-rare. Remove the chops to a serving platter and set aside in a warm place to let the juices redistribute. While the chops are cooking, coat a large saute pan with extra-virgin olive oil and over medium heat add the garlic cloves. When the garlic has become golden brown and is very aromatic, remove and discard the garlic. It has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the potatoes, season with salt and brown the potatoes on each side. When the potatoes are brown on each side, add the mushrooms and season with salt. Saute the mushrooms for 5 to 7 minutes. When the mushrooms have become soft and aromatic, add in the cherry peppers and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pepper vinegar (more if you like things REALLY spicy). Add the vinegar in baby steps, it can make things VERY spicy and there will not be any recovery. Check for seasoning and season with salt if needed (it will). Toss in the chives. Transfer the potato mixture to a serving bowl or platter and serve immediately with the veal chops drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil.

Place the chicken presentation-side down on a baking tray and sprinkle with half of the salt, tarragon, pepper, thyme and garlic. Flip the chicken, then sprinkle with the remaining salt, pepper and garlic. Spoon the oil over the chicken and rub to fully coat. Add the remaining thyme and tarragon, and then bake until the internal temperature is 165 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, place the bacon on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake in the same oven for 8 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet and bake 8 more minutes. The bacon should be almost fully cooked. Chill the chicken until fully cooled. Using a very sharp knife, slice the chicken on a vertical bias across the breast into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Halve the ciabatta horizontally, then set it up open-face to build the sandwiches. Spread half of the ranch dressing onto the bottom piece of ciabatta. Stack the sliced chicken over the ranch, creating two or three layers. Cover the chicken with the sliced Cheddar and then top with the bacon. Bake both halves of the sandwich until the cheese melts, the bacon is crisp and the bread is toasted. Coat the top piece of ciabatta with the remaining ranch dressing. Top the bacon with the avocado, and then finish the sandwich with the top piece of bread. Cut into 4 pieces to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 48997,&quot;Meatballs with Tomato Sauce 1 ounce garlic, minced 1 ounce kosher salt 1 ounce oregano, minced 1 ounce parsley, minced 1 ounce Tomato Sauce, recipe follows 1 whole egg 6 ounces ground beef 6 ounces ground pork 6 ounces ground veal Grapeseed oil, for searing 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced or minced 1 large onion yellow, diced 1/2 cup dry red wine 2 cups minced or grated carrots 3 tablespoons thyme leaves, minced 30 ounces whole peeled tomatoes, crushed 1 cup chopped fresh basil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a bowl, blend the garlic, salt, oregano, parsley, Tomato Sauce and egg, mixing well with a whisk. Next, by hand, add the ground beef, pork and veal, mixing well, ensuring not to over-mix. After mixing, portion the meatballs to desired size, 1 1/2 to 2 ounces, then allow to rest in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. This will allow the meatballs to bind. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Over medium-high heat, add enough grapeseed oil to coat the bottom of a large skillet. Sear the meatballs until browned, 2 to 3 minutes each side. After searing, finish the meatballs in the oven until cooked through. This time will vary according to the size of the meatballs. Over medium-high heat, add the olive oil to a saucepan and heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook until the onions soften. Next, add the wine, deglazing the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and add the carrots and thyme, cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Finally, add the tomatoes and their juices, bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the basil and continue to cook over a low heat for 20 to 30 minutes. Season to taste and remove from the heat.

Mix chicken with apple, syrup, grill seasoning, poultry seasoning, cinnamon and nutmeg and score the meat into 4 sections. Form 4 large, thin patties and set into hot butter and oil. Cook 5 minutes on each side. Place fork split muffins on broiler pan and toast. Butter toasted muffins and reserve. Heat a second nonstick skillet over medium heat and melt a tablespoon of butter in the pan. Beat eggs with milk, salt and pepper and scramble to desired doneness. Pile 1 sausage patty, 1/4 of the eggs and Cheddar cheese on each of 4 muffin halves. Return muffins to broiler to melt cheese, 1 to 2 minutes, then set tops into place and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 48999,&quot;Spanakopita 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, chopped 1/2 cup chopped green onions, white and green parts 3 garlic cloves, minced 2 pounds fresh baby spinach, trimmed, washed and roughly chopped 1/2 lemon, juiced 2 eggs, lightly beaten 12 ounces crumbled feta 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 pound unsalted butter, melted 1 pound phyllo pastry sheets 1/4 cup finely chopped oregano 1/4 cup finely chopped chives 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Heat olive oil in a large skillet and place over medium heat. Saute onions and garlic for 3 minutes until soft. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper, and continue to saute until the spinach is limp, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice, remove from heat and place in a colander, and squeeze out excess liquid. Set aside to cool. The filling needs to be cool and dry to prevent the phyllo from becoming soggy. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with feta, coriander, and nutmeg. Season, then fold in the cooled spinach mixture until well blended. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, brush 2 baking sheets with some melted butter. Unroll the phyllo dough and lay a sheet flat on a work surface. Take care to keep the phyllo covered with a damp, not wet, towel as you work to prevent drying out and becoming brittle. Brush the sheet with melted butter, then sprinkle evenly with some oregano and chives. Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, stacking on top of each other. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the sheets lengthwise into thirds to form 2 1/2-inch strips. Do this with all the sheets of dough. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling near 1 corner of the layered phyllo strip. Fold the end at an angle over the filling to form a triangle. Continue to fold the triangle along the strip until you reach the end, like folding up a flag. Brush the top with butter and dust with Parmesan, place on prepared baking sheet, and cover while preparing the remaining pastries. Repeat until all the filling and phyllo strips are used up. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the triangles are crisp and golden. Serve hot, warm or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 49000,&quot;Spicy Swiss Chard and Artichoke Dip 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the baking dish 2 tablespoons minced garlic<br> 4 slices thick-cut applewood-smoked bacon, diced<br> 8 cups (lightly packed) roughly chopped Swiss chard, stems removed<br> One 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, drained, rinsed, roughly chopped<br> 1/4 cup sliced pickled jalapenos, drained 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained and finely chopped 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups milk<br> 1/4 cup ricotta cheese<br> 1/2 cup cream cheese, softened<br> 1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus extra for topping<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Tortilla chips, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Use an electric hand mixer to mix ingredients together. Add lime juice, cream cheese and goat cheese pulsing until smooth and blended well. Add a bit more salt, if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 49002,&quot;All-Butter Easy Pie Dough 2 cups (240 grams) all-purpose flour, cold 1 teaspoon (6 grams) salt<br> 1 tablespoon (11 grams) sugar<br> 1 cup (225 grams) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and chilled in the freezer for 10 minutes<br> 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) ice water<br> 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) lemon juice<br> Instructions: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the flour, salt, sugar and butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal with some pea-size pieces of butter remaining. In a small bowl, stir together the ice water and the lemon juice. Slowly add the liquid to the flour mixture, pulsing, until the dough just comes together. Squeeze a small piece of dough between your thumb and index finger to make sure it holds its shape. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half. Gently turn over each piece of dough a few times so that any dry bits are incorporated. Form each piece into a loose disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49003,&quot;Spaetzle 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 large eggs 1/4 cup milk 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. In another mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg-milk mixture. Gradually draw in the flour from the sides and combine well; the dough should be smooth and thick. Let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Bring 3 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot, then reduce to a simmer. To form the spaetzle, hold a large holed colander or slotted spoon over the simmering water and push the dough through the holes with a spatula or spoon. Do this in batches so you don&#39;t overcrowd the pot. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until the spaetzle floats to the surface, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Dump the spaetzle into a colander and give it a quick rinse with cool water. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add the spaetzle; tossing to coat. Cook the spaetzle for 1 to 2 minutes to give the noodles some color, and then sprinkle with the chopped chives and season with salt and pepper before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 49004,&quot;Bukhari Rice with Chicken 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 large onion, sliced 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, patted dry 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 cardamom pods 1/4 cup tomato paste 1 tomato, diced 3 cups water 3 carrots, cut into small julienne Salt 1 1/2 cups basmati rice Instructions: Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion slices and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken breasts and cook on each side until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the turmeric, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, black pepper and cardamom pods, mix together and cook on medium heat until the chicken is opaque all over, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste, diced tomato and 1 1/2 cups of the water and bring to a boil. Cover the pot, reduce the heat and cook until the tomatoes are softened and the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Add the carrots and some salt and cook for 5 minutes for the flavors to blend. Add the rice on top and the remaining 1 1/2 cups water and cook on low heat, covered, until the rice is tender, about 30 minutes.

Set liners in muffin cups. Put the chocolate and prune juice in a microwave safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on low power, stirring occasionally, until completely melted. Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and yolk with an electric hand mixer at high speed until slightly thick and lemon colored, about 3 minutes. Slowly add buttermilk, oil, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs, beating until thoroughly combined. Add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Divide the batter among muffin tins, filling them 1/2 of the way. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean and the tops spring back when pressed gently, about 25 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tin on a rack for 10 minutes then remove from the tin and cool completely. For the frosting: Beat the butter, peanut butter, and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk mixing until the frosting is smooth. Add food coloring as desired. Refrigerate the frosting until firm. To decorate the cakes: For the witches hat, score a circle in the middle of a cupcake. Cut a deep cone-like shape with a knife held at an angle. Rotate the cupcake to complete the circle and remove the center. Repeat with all the cupcakes. Generously scoop or pipe enough frosting into the center of each cupcake to fill the hole and to come over the cake to make a face. Top with a chocolate wafer cookie. Put a dot of frosting in the middle of the wafer cookie and invert the cone shaped piece of cake on top to make a witches hat. Use skinny licorice, toasted coconut or cereal flakes for hair and candies for eyes and/or nose. Refrigerate for up to 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 49006,&quot;Korean-Style Pork Wraps with Chili Sauce 1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, trimmed 1/4 cup soy sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 1/2 cup chopped green onions 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 2 tablespoons Sriracha hot chili sauce 4 teaspoons honey 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted 1 1/2 cups cooked jasmine rice 1 head Boston, Bibb, or butter lettuce, leaves separated, washed, and patted dry Instructions: Wrap the pork tenderloin in several sheets of plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 40 minutes. (This is to make it easier to thinly slice, so make sure it doesn&#39;t freeze completely.) In a medium mixing bowl, combine the soy sauce, sugar, 2 teaspoons of the sesame oil, green onion, garlic, and ginger. Whisk together until the sugar dissolves. Take the pork out of the freezer and unwrap on a clean cutting board. Slice the pork into thin strips, about 1/4-inch thick, 1/4-inch wide, and 2 1/2 inches long. Place the pork strips in the soy marinade, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. In a small mixing bowl, combine the Sriracha hot chili sauce, the honey, and the remaining 2 teaspoons of sesame oil. Stir to combine. Set aside. When the pork has marinated, take the bowl out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pork from the marinade and carefully place in the skillet. (Be careful that the drippings don&#39;t splatter out of the pan.) Cook the pork, stirring constantly with tongs or a wooden spoon, 4 to 5 minutes, until the pork is cooked through. Remove from the heat and stir in the sesame seeds. To serve, spoon several tablespoons of rice into the center of a lettuce leaf, taco-style. Top with a few pork strips and drizzle with a few drops of the chili mixture.

Sift the cake flour and cocoa powder together in a small mixing bowl and set aside. Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and whip until foamy with an electric mixer set on medium speed. Make a French meringue by adding the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. When you whip egg whites, add the sugar slowly to allow the whites to gain some volume. When you have volume, add the rest of the sugar. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip to stiff but not dry peaks, about 5 minutes. When the whites are slightly stiff, reduce the mixer speed to low to allow even more air to be incorporated without over whipping the egg whites. Let the egg whites continue to whip for about another 2 minutes. Stop whipping them if they begin to look dry or separated. Very gently, fold the egg yolks into the whipped egg whites with a rubber spatula until they are partially incorporated. Carefully fold the sifted mixture into the egg mixture. It is important to fold as gently as possible to avoid deflating the batter. Remember to fold all the way to the bottom of the bowl to fully incorporate both mixtures. Place the batter in a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch plain tip. To pipe the ladyfingers, hold the pastry bag at a slight angle and allow the tip to touch the parchment paper as you start to pipe. Squeeze gently, applying even pressure as you pipe the desired length, then stop squeezing and lift the tip straight up, leaving a small tail on the end of each ladyfinger. Pipe evenly shaped ladyfingers about 3/4-inch wide on a parchment paper-covered sheet pan. Space them about 1/2-inch apart to allow them room to spread as they bake. Dust the tops of the ladyfingers with powdered sugar to give them a nice crust. Bake the ladyfingers until light and evenly browned, about 5 minutes. (The browning may be difficult to discern with the chocolate ladyfingers.) Remove from the oven and immediately move to a wire rack to prevent the heat of the pan from continuing to bake the ladyfingers. Set aside until ready to use. When cooled, the ladyfingers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the freezer, well wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 49010,&quot;Sourdough Biscuits 4 cups Sourdough Starter, recipe follows 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 1/3 cup sugar 2 teaspoons salt 3 heaping teaspoons baking powder 3/4 cup vegetable oil 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 stick butter, melted 1 tablespoon active dry yeast 4 cups warm water (105 to 115 degrees F) 1/3 cup sugar 4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted 1 raw potato Instructions: Prepare the Sourdough Starter the night before. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle yeast in the starter and stir. Add sugar and stir. Add salt and stir. Add baking powder and stir. Add oil and then gradually add flour. Place dough on a floured board and sprinkle more flour on top of dough. Flatten dough by hand and then cut with a biscuit cutter. Spray a 16-inch Dutch oven with non-stick cooking spray and then add a little oil to the bottom of the Dutch oven. Place biscuits in Dutch oven, being careful not to overcrowd them. Top with melted butter and set aside to let rise until wrinkles are gone. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Dissolve yeast in warm water and whisk to combine. Add sugar and whisk until sugar dissolves. Add sifted flour, 1 cup at a time, whisking after each addition to combine. Peel, wash, and grate the raw potato and add it to the flour mixture. Place starter in a very clean, wide bowl, cover it with a towel, and let rest in a warm place overnight.

Add about one third of the chilled butter and process until thoroughly combined (the mixture will be slightly yellow). Add the remaining chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add the parsley and vinegar in a single pulse. Gradually add the ice water through the feed tube pulsing just until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together, it should just hold its shape and be a little crumbly. If still very powdery, pulse again, adding up to 2 tablespoons ice water. Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Pat about two thirds of the dough into a square about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining third of dough. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Adjust the oven rack to the bottom position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch-square baking dish. For the collard filling: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the collard greens in batches, stirring between each addition to submerge the greens. Return to a boil and cook until the greens are bright green and just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and shake off any excess water. Let cool completely. Gently squeeze out only some of the excess liquid from the greens and transfer to a large bowl. Add the sausage, scallions, butter, hot sauce and 3/4 teaspoon salt and toss to combine. For the corn filling: Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, egg, melted butter, sugar, baking powder, salt and 3/4 cup of the cream in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in the Cheddar. To assemble the pie: Let the dough pieces stand at room temperature for a few minutes until slightly softened to make rolling easier. Place the larger piece of dough between two large pieces of floured parchment. Roll into a rough 14-inch square (if the dough gets too soft, pop it in the fridge to firm up, then continue rolling). Roll the smaller piece into a rough 12-inch square. Transfer the larger piece of dough to the prepared baking dish. Gently press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the dish, leaving some overhang. Brush the bottom and sides with the remaining 1 tablespoon cream. Add the corn filling and spread evenly. Pile the collard filling on top and spread evenly. Put the remaining dough over the filling, lining up the edges with the bottom piece of dough as best you can. Pinch the edges together, trim any excess, then fold and crimp the edges to form a tight seal. Brush the top and edges of the crust with the egg and cut decorative slits in the top of the pie. Bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling bubbles out a little through the slits, 50 to 60 minutes. (If the crust browns too quickly, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let cool at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gamay]&quot; 49012,&quot;2 Terrific Salad Sides: 3 Bean Salad and Potato Salad with Sweet Red Pepper and Onion 16 new red potatoes Coarse salt, for boiling water 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 1/2 red onion, chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint, a couple of handfuls 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, a couple of handfuls 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar, eyeball the amount 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, eyeball the amount Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 pound fresh green beans, washed and cut into 1/3 2 rounded teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, eyeball the amount 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball the amount 1 (15-ounce) cans red kidney beans, rinsed and drained 1 (15-ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place red potatoes in a pot and cover with water.

Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the rhubarb is completely broken down, about 15 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a separate saucepan, pressing firmly on the rhubarb to squeeze out the syrup; reserve the rhubarb. Set aside 1/2 cup syrup for glazing. Make the compote: Add 1/4 cup of the rhubarb solids to the remaining syrup in the saucepan (discard the rest of the solids). Add half of the grapes, the onion, 1 tablespoon mustard, the chopped thyme, red pepper flakes and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, crushing the grapes with a wooden spoon, until the grapes break down and the sauce thickens, about 12 minutes. Add the remaining grapes and 1 tablespoon mustard and simmer 6 more minutes. Let cool completely. (The compote can be made up to 3 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Make the ham: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the brown sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons mustard with the reserved 1/2 cup rhubarb syrup in a bowl; set aside. Remove the skin and all but about 1/4 inch fat from the ham. Score the fat with a small sharp knife in a tight crosshatch pattern, making the cuts about 1/2 inch apart. Put the ham flat-side down on a rack in a roasting pan. Add 1 cup water to the pan and tent the ham with foil. Roast 1 1/2 hours. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Uncover the ham and brush with the rhubarb-mustard syrup. Continue roasting, brushing with more syrup every 15 minutes, until the ham is golden brown and glazed all over, about 1 1/2 more hours. Transfer to a platter; garnish with thyme sprigs. Serve with the grape-rhubarb compote. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 49019,&quot;Brown Sugar Caramel Creme Brulee Cupcakes 10 ounces all-purpose flour 8 ounces brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 8 ounces sour cream 5 ounces eggs 3 1/2 ounces vegetable oil 3 1/2 ounces prepared vanilla pudding 2 ounces buttermilk 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 ounces granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste 4 large egg yolks 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 8 ounces butter, at room temperature 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 pound 4 ounces powdered sugar 2 3/4 ounces dulce de leche caramel 2 1/2 ounces evaporated milk 1/4 ounce vanilla extract Granulated sugar, for garnish Fresh raspberries, for garnish Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a regular-size cupcake pan with 20 paper liners and set aside. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, measure the flour, brown sugar, baking soda and salt and whisk to combine. Then measure the sour cream, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla pudding, buttermilk and vanilla extract into the mixing bowl and mix on low speed for 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl using a rubber spatula. Turn the mixer back on medium speed and mix until just combined. Use a rubber spatula to stir the batter. Make sure that all flour and dry ingredients are completely combined into the batter. Fill 20 cupcake liners two-thirds full with batter and bake until the top bounces back when touched, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the creme brulee filling: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Whisk together the sugar, vanilla bean paste and egg yolks in a mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in the heavy cream until completely combined. Pour the mixture into a 9-by-9-inch casserole dish. Place the casserole dish on an 18-by-13-inch cookie sheet, and pour 2 cups of water into the bottom of the cookie sheet to use as a water bath. Bake until set (when it does not jiggle when shaken) for 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely. Once completely cooled, scoop up all of the baked creme brulee and put in a pastry bag. Cut 1/2-inch off the top of the pastry bag. Set aside. For the caramel frosting: Whip the butter and cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until soft and fluffy. Stop the mixer and add approximately half of the powdered sugar. Turn the mixer onto low for 30 seconds, and then to medium until combined. Stop the mixer and add the rest of the powdered sugar along with the dulce de leche, evaporated milk and vanilla extract. Mix the frosting on low until the powdered sugar starts to incorporate. Then turn the mixer to medium-high and mix until very light and fluffy. Put the frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. To assemble: Using a large round piping tip, cut a hole in the center of each baked cupcake. Fill each cupcake generously with the creme brulee filling. Then frost the top of each cupcake with the caramel frosting. Sprinkle each frosted cupcake with 1 teaspoon granulated sugar. With a torch, torch the sugar on top of each cupcake until golden brown. Garnish with a fresh raspberry and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49020,&quot;Almond, Cheese and Rosemary Omelet 1 Tbsp. Canola oil ? cup Fisher?

When it begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat and add the almonds. Stir them to coat with the oil and put the skillet back on the heat. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the nuts brown, 30 seconds. Add the rosemary and stir until it gets slightly crisp and pale green, 15 to 30 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to remove the nuts and rosemary onto a kitchen towel. Season with a pinch of salt. 3.Whisk together the eggs, water and ? tsp. salt. Whisk only enough to integrate the eggs. You don&#39;t want to whip too much air into them or make them frothy. Place the skillet on the stove over medium heat and add the butter. Swirl the butter around as it melts so it coats the whole surface of the pan. Pour in the egg mixture. Allow mixture to cook for 1 minute then use a wooden spoon to stir the eggs for 1 minute, as if you were scrambling them. Then, allow the eggs to cook, undisturbed, over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes; the eggs will appear to be about halfway set. Sprinkle the cheese and ? of almond mixture and place the pan in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes or until the center is cooked. Pull out of the oven. 4.Lift the handle of the pan up tilting the pan away from you and towards the plate. This tilting should cause the omelet to slide down in the pan a little. Fold the omelet in half. Sprinkle with the remaining almonds and rosemary.

Once boiling, remove from the heat and pour into a copper pot. Add the flour and, with a wooden paddle, create a hole in the middle of the mixture so that the water begins to bubble over. Place on the stove and simmer slowly for 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and beat vigorously with the paddle/wooden spoon until the polenta forms a smooth, firm consistency. Place the mixture on a wooden board, and shape into a large ball with your hands (cold water will help keep your hands cool). Allow to cool for 30 minutes. In the meantime, cut the pancetta into small cubes and saute in a frying pan with the olive oil. Once the pancetta has turned a golden brown, splash the balsamic vinegar into the pan and allow the pancetta to caramelize with the sweet vinegar. It is now ready to serve with the polenta. Assemble the dish onto a plate: a wedge of polenta, pancetta and a fresh slice of ricotta cheese. The flavors will balance each other perfectly and all you need is a generous drizzle of olive oil and thyme and marjoram to garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Priorat]</p><p>&quot; 49024,&quot;Caribbean-Style Burger with Jerk Ketchup and Beer Battered Onions 1/2 cup ketchup 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne<br> 1/2 teaspoon cl flakes<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 lime, juiced Canola oil, for frying 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 12-ounce bottle dark beer<br> 1 large white onion Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 to 8 ounces ground beef 1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons cl flakes<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme<br> Olive oil, for drizzling Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 to 4 hamburger buns Instructions: For the ketchup: Combine the ketchup with the allspice, cayenne, cl flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, thyme and lime juice.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the hot pan and heat the butter until it begins to foam. Add the first breast and sear, cooking for 3 to 4 minutes on a side before turning it over and allowing another 4 minutes on the second side. Remove the chicken from the pan and place on a warm platter. Repeat for the remaining chicken breasts, adding butter to the pan and sauteeing both sides. After all the chicken has been cooked and removed from the pan, add the shallots and cook two minutes until translucent. Lower the heat, move the pan away, and cautiously add the brandy. Being careful not to flame the brandy, return the pan to the stove, and over low heat, allow it to cook off. Add the white wine to the pan, raise the heat, and bring quickly to the boil. Stir in the mustard. Allow this to cook for 1 minute before adding the veal stock. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the cream. Bring just to the boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the chives.

Fill the well with 3 tablespoons of the cheese. Gently press to form a patty and completely cover the well of cheese. Heat grill pan or grill over medium-high heat (about 400 degrees F). Liberally oil the grill pan or grill. Cook the burger patties until a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees F and the cheese is melted on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes on each side. The cheese inside the burgers is hot, so let the burgers rest 5 minutes before serving. Toss the peaches with the olive oil in a small bowl. Season with a pinch of salt. Place the peaches on the grill until grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Be careful not to overcook the fruit. Grill only until grill marks are present on each side. Whisk together the mayonnaise, hot sauce and remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble the burgers, spread the sauce on the bottom bun. Add the arugula and the burger patty and top it off with a sliced peach. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</li></ul><p>&quot; 49084,&quot;Jambalaya 1/3 pound bacon 2 medium chopped onions 1 medium bell pepper 3 ribs celery, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/2 cup green onion tops 1 teaspoon garlic powder Salt and red or black pepper 8 cups hot water 2 tablespoons Kitchen Bouquet, recipe follows 2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 4 cups long grain rice Instructions: In a heavy 6-quart pot, brown the bacon until crisp.

Add enough of the chicken broth to just cover. Bring the liquid to a boil over moderate heat and simmer, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is just cooked through. Let cool in broth. Drain and cut into strips. Make the dressing: In a food processor or blender combine ingredients and process until combined well. In a bowl combine the chicken with the scallion, carrot, snow peas, basil, mint and cilantro. Add the dressing and toss to combine. In a deep fat fryer heat the oil until hot. Add the rice noodles and cook until crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Arrange rice noodles on serving plate and top with the chicken salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 49095,&quot;Basil Oil 2 ounces fresh basil leaves (about 2 cups packed) 3/4 cup canola, grapeseed or other vegetable oil Salt Instructions: In a small bowl, combine 1 cup ice cubes with 1 cup water. Set it aside. Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the basil leaves all at once, stirring to make sure they are submerged, and cook for 10 seconds. Immediately transfer them, using a slotted spoon, to the ice bath. Once they have cooled, remove the basil leaves and set them on paper towels. Squeeze the paper towels gently but firmly in your hands to absorb as much liquid as possible. Pour the oil into a blender, add teaspoon salt and mix on high speed. While the machine is running, add half the basil leaves and process briefly. Then add the remaining basil and puree it (doing this in batches prevents bruising the leaves and keeps the color intact). Transfer the basil oil to a small container, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. (If you like, strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve.) &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Albari?o]&quot; 49096,&quot;Mini Chicken Potpies 1 3/4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 6) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 leeks (white and light green parts only), sliced 1/4 inch thick 1 fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced, plus 1 tablespoon chopped fronds 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup Pernod or white wine Pinch of saffron (optional) 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 2 medium red-skinned potatoes (about 1/2 pound), diced 3 small plum tomatoes, finely chopped 1 17-ounce box frozen puff pastry, thawed 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Set the chicken in a small roasting pan; season with 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Roast until golden and cooked through, about 40 minutes; let cool. Shred the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and fennel and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour; cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the Pernod and saffron; simmer until the liquid is almost evaporated, about 1 more minute. Add 3/4 cup water, the heavy cream, orange zest, potatoes and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook until the potatoes are almost tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the shredded chicken, tomatoes and fennel fronds; season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Set out six 8-to-10-ounce ramekins. Unfold the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Gently roll out the pastry so it is extended by about 1/2 inch in each direction. Using a ramekin as a guide, cut out 6 rounds slightly larger than the ramekins with a paring knife. Divide the filling among the ramekins, filling each nearly to the top. Brush the rim and outer edge of 1 ramekin with the beaten egg. Set a puff pastry round on top and gently press around the edge to secure the dough. Repeat. Brush the remaining egg over the pastry. Transfer the potpies to a baking sheet and bake until the pastry is domed and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 49097,&quot;Pizza with Arugula and Mozzarella 1/4 Pizza Dough (recipe follows) Cornmeal for sprinkling 8 slices fresh mozzarella, each one about 1/4 inch thick and 1 1/2 inches in diameter 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt 1/2 cup very firmly packed fresh arugula 1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup milk, at room temperature 1 cup water, almost hot to the touch (about 125 degrees) 2 tablespoon dry yeast or 1 1/2 ounce fresh yeast 2 2/3 cups sifted Tipo 00 flour or cake flour 1/3 cup sifted all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon fine salt Olive oil for oiling the bowl Instructions: Pre-heat oven with pizza stone in it to 525 degrees. Shape a pizza, and let it rise a second time. When ready to cook, sprinkle a pizza peel with cornmeal. Carefully place the pizza on the paddle. Inside the rim, arrange the mozzarella slices evenly. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon of the coarse salt. Sprinkle cornmeal on pizza stone in oven. Slide pizza onto pizza stone. Bake 6 minutes. (If a softer crust is desired, dab rim with moistened brush after 3 minutes, and then cook 3 minutes more.) Remove, and immediately scatter the arugula on the cheese. Sprinkle on the remaining 1/8 teaspoon of coarse salt. Drizzle oil over all and serve immediately. In a small bowl or coffee cup mix together the milk and water. Sprinkle in the dry yeast, or crumble the fresh yeast in your hand and mix it into the liquid. Stir once, and let sit in a warm place until there is considerable foam on the top, about 10 to 20 minutes. (If your mixture doesn&#39;t foam up at least a little, the yeast wasn&#39;t fresh. Buy more and start over.) In a large bowl combine the sifted flours with the salt. Mix well. Spill the foaming yeast mixture into the bowl and, working with a wooden spoon, mix together rapidly. Smooth out as many yeast clumps as possible during this stage. Your dough at this point will be very wet. Dust a work surface with flour. Add a little flour, about 1/4 cup, to the dough in the mixing bowl. This should enable you to scrape the dough together and place it on the floured surface. Add more flour if necessary. Begin kneading the dough on the work surface with your hands and adding Tipo 00 flour or cake flour, 1/4 cup at first, less and less as you proceed. While you are kneading, at first the dough will probably stick to the work surface and your hands. Don&#39;t worry. Keep kneading and adding more flour. But don&#39;t lose patience and add too much. Add slowly. The goal is to create dough that is just past sticky; in fact, when it is finished, it should be threatening to stick to the work surface. You may even want to work with a spatula to remove the dough from the surface if it sticks slightly. All-together, kneading time should be about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth, silky, and just past stickiness. Do not end up with very dry, very stable dough. Lightly oil the bottom of a large bowl with the olive oil. Form the dough into a ball. Place the dough in the bowl, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a spot that&#39;s room temperature, neither warm nor cool. In 2 hours or so, the dough should double in size. Cut the dough into 4 quarters. Place 1 quarter on a floured surface, pulling it gently into a round as you place it on the surface. Your goal is a round pizza that is 6 to 7 inches in diameter, approximately 1/4-inch thick, except at the rim where it should be about 3/8 inch thick. Use one of the following means to achieve this: * Pull it from the outer edges until the desired shape is reached. * Working it with your fingertips, push toward the rim, until the center is 1/4 inch thick and the rim is 3/8 inch thick. * Do it pizzeria style by placing the dough on your 2 fists, and revolving it on your fists until it has widened to the desired shape (be careful not to tear the dough at the center). * Use these techniques in combination. Do not roll your dough out. Don&#39;t worry if your pizza isn&#39;t perfectly round; there&#39;s much to be said for rusticity. If your pizza doesn&#39;t have much of a rim, use your fingertips to crimp the dough and build a small one around the circumference; this is called the cornicione. If your pizza dough has a tear in it, transplant a small piece of dough, smoothing it in. Run a wide spatula under the pizza to make sure you&#39;ll be able to move it easily off the surface later; add extra flour underneath if it&#39;s sticking. Repeat this process until all 4 pizzas are shaped. Place towels loosely over the pizzas as soon as they&#39;re shaped. Let each pizza rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 60 minutes before cooking. The pizzas should puff very slightly. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Barbera]&quot; 49098,&quot;Green cl Stew 3 baking potatoes, like russets, peeled and diced 1 large yellow Mexican onion, diced 2 tablespoons crushed fresh garlic 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 cups chopped roasted green cl 10 cups water 1 1/2 tablespoons salt 2 cups flour 1/2 cups water Lettuce and tomatoes, as a garnish Instructions: Saute the potatoes, onions, and garlic in the vegetable oil for 5 minutes or until almost soft.

Butter a 9-inch cake pan, then line the bottom with parchment paper and butter again. Dust the pan lightly with rice flour. Spread the cooked rice along the bottom of the pan. Warm the milk in a small saucepan over low heat. Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon zest and salt in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium until pale yellow and the eggs start to thicken, about 1 1/2 minutes, being careful not to overwhip which will cause the cake to rise and deflate when baked. Slowly stir about half the warm milk into the eggs to temper, then add all the eggs to the saucepan and heat, stirring constantly until it thickens slightly and almost coats the back of a spoon, 6 to 8 minutes. Gently pour the custard over the rice and bake until the cake is just cooked through and wiggles only slightly in the very center, 40 to 50 minutes. While the cake cooks, make the red wine cherry sauce. Combine the cherries, sugar and wine in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until the fruit softens and the liquid is reduced and syrupy, about 10 minutes. Cool and set aside. Transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes.

Chill a large metal bowl and all the grinder parts until very cold. For the sausage: Assemble the grinder with the chilled parts using the large-holed grinding plate. Combine the pork, garlic, fennel pollen, salt, crushed red pepper flakes, fennel seeds and Parmesan in the chilled metal bowl. Pass the meat through the grinder back into the chilled metal bowl. Switch to the medium-size plate and pass the ground meat through again. Add 1/4 cup ice water and quickly knead the meat mixture together with your hands. Fit the horn (stuffing attachment) onto the grinder. Grease the horn with oil and gently slide the hog casing onto the attachment, leaving about 2 inches at the end. Add meat to the hopper and turn the grinder on. Let the air run through the casing until the meat starts to come out. Once you see the meat, turn the machine off and knot the casing end. Turn the machine back on and keep feeding the meat mixture into the machine. Using your other hand, guide the casing off the horn as it fills. Continue until you run out of casing, leaving a short tail on the end. Form the filled casing into links by gently pinching and then twisting it. The sausage links should be equal in size, 3 to 4 inches each. Tie each twist with twine and puncture the links all over with a teasing needle or sausage pricker. You should have 8 to 10 links total. For the toppings and assembly: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Blanch the broccoli rabe until bright green, about 30 seconds then use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer to a bowl. Leave the water on the heat for the sausages. When cool enough to handle, Squeeze out the excess moisture in the broccoli rabe and roughly chop. Set aside. Reduce the blanching water to low heat so it is hot, but not bubbling. Carefully drop the sausages into the hot water and poach for 10 to 12 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until they reach an internal temperature of 150 to 156 degrees F. Remove from the poaching liquid and place on a baking sheet. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saute pan and add the onions with a pinch of salt. Sweat the onions until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes, then add the cherry peppers and broccoli rabe. Toss everything together and add a splash of the pickled pepper brine. Season to taste with salt. Remove to a bowl and wipe out the saute pan. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the same pan over medium heat and brown sausages on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Lower the heat if they start to burst. Open the hoagie rolls and use your fingers to scoop out some of the bread from the top part of the roll. Brush the cut sides of each roll with olive oil and place open faced on a baking sheet. Toast in the oven until warmed through until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Lay provolone slices on the toasted rolls and melt in the oven, 3 to 4 minutes. Cut the sausage links apart, remove the strings and slice on a bias. Lay the slices over the melted provolone and top with the broccoli rabe-pepper mix and more provolone. Transfer back to the oven to heat through and continue melting cheese, 3 to 5 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 49138,&quot;Orange Brulee 1 large orange 1/2 teaspoon butter<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> Instructions: Slice the orange in half and blot dry with a paper towel.

Repeat with remaining egg mixture. When the crepes are cool enough to handle, stack, roll and slice them into thin julienne strips. Set aside until ready to use. For the fried rice: Set a large wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat and swirl in 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil. Add the marinated shrimp and stir fry until slightly pink, about 2 minutes.

Whisk to combine and to break up any lumps of flour. Add the water and use a spatula to begin to mix the ingredients. Add the melted butter and the remaining 3 cups of flour and mix again until a very shaggy dough forms. Attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the dough hook. Knead the dough on medium-low until all the dough has pulled away from the sides of the bowl and is elastic and soft to the touch, about 7 minutes. Remove the dough from the mixer and divide into 2 pieces. Add one half back to the mixer bowl and add the other half to a large glass bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the dough in the glass bowl; turn it once to coat and cover it with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Add the rosemary to the dough in the mixer. Turn the mixer on and knead until the rosemary is evenly incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the dough from the mixer and place it in a separate large glass bowl. Drizzle it with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil; turn it once to coat and cover it with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Allow both doughs to proof in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. After the dough has doubled in size, fill a large Dutch oven, fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, with about 2 inches of vegetable oil and heat to 360 degrees F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and two rimmed baking sheets with wire racks. Set aside. To assemble the Parmesan-rosemary dough balls, use your thumb and index finger to pinch off about 2 tablespoons of dough. Place a cube of Parmesan in the center and close the dough around it, pinching the seam to seal it. Place it seam side down on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Continue the process with the remaining rosemary dough and Parmesan. Set aside the finished dough balls. To assemble the jam-filled dough balls, use your thumb and index finger to pinch off 2 to 3 tablespoons of dough. Flatten the dough slightly, then spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of the jam into the center of the dough. Carefully pull the edges of dough up and over the jam, pinching the seam to seal it, making sure to leave no jam exposed. Place it seam side down on the second parchment-lined baking sheet. Continue the process with the remaining dough and jam. When the oil is at 360 degrees F, carefully lower 5 to 6 Parmesan-rosemary dough balls into the hot oil. Fry, turning as needed until golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a wire rack-lined baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle with salt. Fry the remaining Parmesan-rosemary dough balls, allowing the oil to come back up to temperature before adding another batch. Serve immediately or keep warm in a low oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Top with freshly grated Parmesan before serving. To fry the jam-filled dough, carefully lower 5 to 6 dough balls into the hot oil Fry, turning as needed until golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to the second wire rack-lined baking sheet. Fry the remaining jam-filled dough balls, allowing the oil to come back up to temperature before adding another batch. Serve immediately or keep warm in a low oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Top with confectioners&#39; sugar before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 49151,&quot;Fontina Risotto with Chicken 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 1/2 cups arborio rice 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 cup dry white wine Kosher salt 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Freshly ground pepper 1 cup coarsely grated fontina cheese, plus more for garnish 8 ounces deli-smoked chicken breast, diced (about 1 1/4 cups) 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Bring the broth and 4 cups water to a simmer in a saucepan; keep warm. Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion; cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and thyme; cook, stirring, until the rice is glossy, about 1 minute. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed. Add 1 teaspoon Kosher salt. Ladle in the hot broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, allowing all of the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue until the rice is just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the thyme. Stir in the parmigiano, the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt and pepper to taste. Gently stir in the fontina and chicken.

Spray a fluted 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom with non-stick cooking spray. In a food processor add hazelnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, salt and 1/4 cup of sugar and pulse until finely ground. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, melt unsalted butter over medium heat, then cook swirling the pan occasionally, until nutty-smelling and deep golden in color, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add the bittersweet chocolate chips. Let stand until melted, about 2 minutes. Whisk the butter and chocolate until smooth, scraping up any browned butter solids from the bottom of the pan. Let cool slightly. In a mixing bowl fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs with the remaining 1 1/4 cups of sugar and coffee mixture on medium speed, about 5 minutes. With mixer on low, add the chocolate-butter mixture, followed by the cocoa-hazelnut mixture. With a spatula scrape batter into prepared pan and bake for about 35 minutes, or until the top is glossy and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let cool until slightly warm. Remove the outer ring from the tart pan. In the center of the tart, place the raspberries in a circle or in the shape of a heart. Garnish with sifted powdered sugar. Serve with ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49153,&quot;Soft Pretzels Two Ways 1 cup baking soda One 8-ounce tube refrigerated crescent dough 1 large egg beaten with a splash of water Flaky salt, for sprinkling Cinnamon sugar, for sprinkling Obatzda (Beer Cheese), recipe follows, for serving Glaze, recipe follows, for serving 8 ounces Camembert or Brie, at room temperature, chopped into large chunks 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup wheat beer 1/4 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives, plus more for topping 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, plus more for topping 1/2 teaspoon ground caraway seeds, optional 1 small yellow onion (or 1/2 large), chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups powdered sugar, plus more if needed 2 to 3 tablespoons milk, plus more if needed 1/4 teaspoon vanilla Instructions: For the baking soda bath: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Spread out the baking soda on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 1 hour. Set aside to cool. This can be prepped ahead and stored in an airtight container for several weeks. (Even though the baked baking soda isn&#39;t as strong as lye, what is traditionally used for making pretzels, it could still potentially irritate your skin, so avoid touching it with bare hands once it&#39;s out of the oven.) To make the baking soda bath: Place the baked baking soda in an 8-inch square baking dish and add 2 cups of water. Gently whisk it to dissolve the baking soda. (It likely won&#39;t all dissolve; a few baking soda chunks are totally okay as long as you remove any that stick to the dough.) Set aside. For the pretzels: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Unroll the dough with a long edge facing you. Cut twelve 1-inch vertical strips. One at a time, twist 6 of the strips a few turns, then form into circles and press the ends together. Transfer to one of the prepared baking sheets, leaving room between each circle. These will be the savory pretzels. Cut the remaining 6 strips into 1-by-2-inch rectangles and transfer to the other prepared baking sheet, leaving room between each rectangle. These will be the sweet pretzels. Working in batches using gloved hands, tongs or a slotted spoon, immerse the pretzel dough pieces in the baking soda bath for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate or pan lined with a paper towel and pat them dry; place them back on the baking sheet. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Sprinkle the circles with flaky salt and the rectangles with cinnamon sugar. Bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes for the rectangles and about 15 minutes for the circles. Serve the savory pretzels with the Obatzda (Beer Cheese) and the sweet pretzels with the Glaze for dipping. Combine the cheese, butter, beer, cream, chives, paprika, caraway if using, onion and some salt and pepper in a food processor and blend to combine until smooth. Transfer to a serving bowl. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper as needed. Top with additional paprika and chives. Add the sugar, milk and vanilla to a bowl and whisk until smooth. If too thick, add more milk as needed. If too thin, add more powdered sugar. Serve with sweet pretzel bites! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 49154,&quot;Mexican Black Bean Chili 3 pounds black beans, dry 2 quarts water 1 1/2 cups onions, chopped 1/2 cup green pepper, chopped plus 1/4 cup green pepper, chopped 2 tablespoons chipotle chili pepper 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 quart chili sauce 1/4 cup red pepper, chopped 1/2 cup tomatoes, diced 3 tablespoons chili powder 1 tablespoon cumin 1 teaspoon lime juice 2 bunches cilantro, chopped 3 cups water or vegetable stock Instructions: Boil the black beans in water with onions, 1/2 cup green peppers, chipotle peppers, salt and pepper.

When they are almost cooked add enough of the ginger soy vinaigrette just to coat them. Cool in a strainer so as to let all of the excess wetness not create a wetness problem for the wrapper. Now lay out one lumpia wrapper at a time. Center the vegetables and a strip of the tuna on the lower third of each wrapper. Roll them up until almost closed folding in the sides as you do. Seal with the water by rubbing the lumpia&#39;s edges with your water moistened fingers. Note: These can be prepared ahead by as much as a full day and kept refrigerated covered with plenty of plastic wrap to keep the wrappers from drying out. For the dish: Wasabi, as desired Heat four bowls until very warm. Place enough oil in a fryer or large pan to fry the stuffed lumpia. Bring the oil to 350 degrees and fry them until crisp. (You may do this in batches keeping them warm). Drain on paper toweling. Cut a tiny amount of the end of each of the lumpia wrappers off. (This is just excess dough and it will allow the lumpia to stand upright). Cut them in half on a strong 45 degree bias angle. Now stand them up and place them in the center of the bowls. Place 3 of the warm clams in each of the four bowls. Now spoon the fermented black bean mixture into the bowls. Place the wasabi on the rims of the dish as desired. Serve. Note: The dish may be garnished with lime wedges, cilantro leaves and/or dots of salsa Sriracha (a very red Southeast Asian hot sauce). Place the clams in a small saucepan with a lid. Add the white wine and steam them open on medium high heat until the clams open. Remove from the heat and set aside, keeping them warm Combine the white wine, mirin, rice wine vinegar, ginger, garlic and jalapeno in a small saucepan on high heat and reduce by half, (about 3 minutes). Add the chicken stock and reduce the mixture to about 1/2 cup, (about 15 minutes.) Add the scallions and the fermented black beans and cook until just a little bit of liquid remains. Whisk in the butter and keep warm. Combine all of the above together and keep at room temperature if preparing the dish directly. Otherwise refrigerate until almost ready to cook Note: Any extra vinaigrette can be stored cold for a week or so. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 49162,&quot;Crispy Duck 6 star anise 4 tablespoons freshly grated ginger 2 tablespoons Shaohsing rice wine or dry sherry 2 tablespoons ground Sichuan peppercorns 2 tablespoons sea salt 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 2 skin-on duck breasts, skin scored in a criss-cross pattern 1 tablespoon groundnut oil (peanut) Salad greens, for service 3 1/2 ounces water 2 ripe plums, stoned and quartered 2 ounces dried apricots, chopped 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon honey 1 cinnamon stick 1 star anise Juice of 1 lime Serving suggestion: This dish is delicious accompanied by stir-fried green beans and roasted sweet potatoes.

Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast over the surface. Sprinkle a pinch of the granulated sugar over the top and let sit without stirring, until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk the butter, vanilla and egg yolk into the yeast mixture. Whisk together the flour, salt, nutmeg and the remaining granulated sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon to make a thick and slightly sticky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape into a ball. Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Put the dough in the buttered bowl, turning to coat lightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and knead briefly to release the excess air; reform into a ball and return to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap and lay it on the dough. Cover the entire bowl tightly with the plastic and proof in the refrigerator for 4 hours or up to overnight. For the filling: Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Whisk the granulated sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Cut off a 3-inch, or 5-ounce, ball of dough and set aside to make turkey heads. Turn the remaining dough onto a floured work surface and press flat. Then roll into an 18-by-10-inch rectangle, with a long edge facing you. Spread the softened butter evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving about a 1-inch border on the side opposite you. Evenly scatter the cinnamon-sugar over the butter. Starting from the long side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight cylinder. Lightly brush the clean edge of the dough with water. Press this edge against the cylinder to seal. Slip a long, taut piece of string or unflavored dental floss under the cylinder, about 1 1/2 inches from the end. Lift and cross the string ends over the cylinder, and then pull the ends tightly in opposite directions to cut a single roll. Repeat, cutting every 1 1/2 inches, to make 12 rolls. Place the rolls cut-side-down in the prepared pan, leaving 1 inch of space between them.<br> Cut the reserved piece of dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a 3/4-inch ball. Set each ball of dough aside in a separate baking dish. These will become the turkeys&#39; heads. Cover the rolls and dough heads loosely with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm place to rise until both double in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes.<br> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Using kitchen shears pointing diagonally upward, make a horizontal snip halfway through the front of each ball of dough to form a pointy beak. Pull the beak down a bit to exaggerate the shape. Place a pecan half halfway inside each snip under the beak to form a \\waddle.\\ Place two currants above the beak for eyes; press lightly to secure. Place each dough head on top of the lower left hand corner of each cut roll to make turkeys.<br> Bake the buns until golden brown and the tops of the buns spring back when pressed lightly, about 30 minutes. (Leave the oven on.) For the glaze: Meanwhile, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a medium bowl. Whisk in the condensed milk, butter and vanilla to make a thick, smooth icing. When the buns come out, cool them in the pan for 10 minutes. Drizzle the glaze evenly over all of the bun bodies, but not the heads.<br> While the buns are cooling, warm the cooked bacon strips in the oven. To serve, remove each bun turkey from the pan. Slice bacon strips in half. Insert four half-strips of bacon into the back-most cinnamon swirl, so that they form an upright fanned turkey tail. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49174,&quot;Pan-Seared Halibut with Charmoula over Quinoa and Asparagus 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 1/2 cups loosely packed cilantro leaves and stems (about 1 bunch) 3/4 cup loosely packed parsley leaves (about 1/2 bunch) 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon smoked paprika Pinch cayenne pepper 1 clove garlic, grated Zest and juice of 1 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt 3/4 cup quinoa (red or white) 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths 1 small white onion, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Four 4-ounce skinless halibut fillets Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the cumin in a small dry skillet over medium-high heat and swirl until toasted and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the cumin to a food processor along with the cilantro, parsley, oil, paprika, cayenne, garlic and lemon zest and juice. Pulse until coarsely blended. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Gradually add the quinoa, lower the heat to medium-high and keep at a rolling simmer for 10 minutes. Add the asparagus and continue to cook for 3 more minutes. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, cook the onions in a medium skillet with the oil over medium-high heat until caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Fold the onions into the quinoa and season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside. Mash 2 of the bananas with a fork in a small bowl so they still have a bit of texture. With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, whip the remaining bananas and sugar together for a good 3 minutes; you want a light and fluffy banana cream. Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla; beat well and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated; no need to overly blend. Fold in the nuts and the mashed bananas with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Give the pan a good rap on the counter to get any air bubbles out. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Don&#39;t get nervous if the banana bread develops a crack down the center of the loaf; that&#39;s no mistake, it&#39;s typical. Rotate the pan periodically to ensure even browning. Cool the bread in the pan for 10 minutes or so, and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

Set aside. In a large Dutch oven, brown the buffalo in the remaining olive oil. Drain any excess fat and add the bell pepper, garlic and onion mixture along with the salt, pepper, oregano, cumin and 2 cups of water. Add the tomatoes and their juice, squishing each tomato with your hand before it goes into the pot. Add the cl puree or whatever cl mixture you are using, stir and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook, partially covered, at a simmer for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the buffalo is tender and the tomatoes have broken down and the whole thing has turned a beautiful dark brick red. If a thicker chili is desired, add the masa harina and water mixture, stirring to thicken. Return to heat and cook about 10 minutes more. If you prefer beans with your chili, add the precooked bean of choice. For the bread bowl: Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water with sugar and 1/2 cup of flour. Let stand for 10 minutes to proof. Combine with remaining water and salt in mixing bowl. Blend well. Add flour a half cup at a time until a loose paste is formed. Add remaining flour and mix on low speed until dough pulls away from side of bowl. The dough should be smooth and elastic at end of kneading process. Let rise, punch down and let rise again. To make bowls, cut off a piece of dough and shape into ball with floured hands, and roll out on floured board to a 1/2 to 1 inch larger diameter than the soup bowl you will be using as a form. Press the chopped jalapeno pepper pieces into the dough avoiding what will be the bottom of the dough bowl (as they make holes in the dough while baking and they leak). Spray the bowl (of course it must be ovenproof) with non-stick spray and place an oiled or parchment covered sheet pan, lightly form the dough over the upside-down bowl, leaving the excess flat on the sheet pan to form a little lip on the dough bowl.

Add the wine, vinegar, orange juice and ginger. Mix them well and reduce by half. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the pan drippings, reduce the heat and simmer until sauce reduces by half. Once sauce is done, strain it through a cheesecloth or fine strainer and set aside. To serve, place the duckling on a large serving tray. Add the orange segments on top and around the duck, and pour the sauce over the duck. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 49185,&quot;Game Day Chocolate Football Cake Recipe : Food Network Kitchen : Food Network 3 ounces semisweet or bitter sweet chocolate, chopped<br> 1 cup flat cola<br> 2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder (not Dutch processed) 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon fine salt 3 large eggs 2 cups sugar 3/4 cups vegetable oil 1 cup buttermilk 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 1/4 cups sugar 9 large egg whites 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch fine salt 1 1/4 pounds (5 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces 1/2 cup natural cocoa powder 2 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, melted Football Sugar Cookies, homemade or store bought, recipe follows 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Instructions: For the cake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter and line the bottom of 9 by 13-inch cake pan with parchment paper, overlapping on 2 sides to create flaps.<br> Put chopped the chocolate in a bowl. Heat cola just to a simmer over low heat and pour over chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes; stir until smooth.<br> Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.<br> In another large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until slightly thickened and pale, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs. Beat on low until combined well, but not aerated. Add the flour mixture and continue to beat until just combined. (Stir lightly with a rubber spatula to remove any pockets of flour.) Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the cake springs back lightly when touched, and a tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.<br> Cool cake completely in the pan on a rack. Run a knife around edge of the pan and invert cake onto a rack. Carefully remove parchment paper and cool completely. (The cake may be made in advance, tightly wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days.) Whisk the flour and salt in a medium bowl.<br> Beat the butter and sugar in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture, and continue beating just until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br> Divide dough in half, pat into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.<br> Generously flour a clean work surface. (Tip: for a nice, even layer of flour, sift flour over work station.) Roll chilled dough about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter, working quickly enough that the dough stays chilled. (If dough gets warm and soft, put it in refrigerator on a lined baking sheet to chill, about 30 minutes.) Transfer cut cookies to un-greased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. Lightly dust off excess flour with a dry pastry brush. Refrigerate the formed cookies for at least 30 minutes. (Excess dough can be gathered together, pressed into a disk, chilled and rerolled.)<br> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bake the cookies, until the bottoms and sides are barely golden, about 12 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49186,&quot;Oysters RockAfeller 2 dozen oysters 1 cup/250ml 35-percent cream 1 teaspoon/5ml Dijon mustard 1 cup/250ml grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 4 cups fresh spinach (1 liter), stemmed 1 cup/250ml breadcrumbs Instructions: Shuck the oysters, reserving the liquid. Place the oysters and liquid in a saucepan. Reserve the deeper half of each oyster shell. Cook the oysters over medium heat for about 30 seconds, just to give them some firmness. With a slotted spoon, remove the oysters to a bowl and set aside. Add the cream to the oyster liquid in the pan and cook for 10 minutes to reduce. Add the mustard and half the cheese. Set aside. In another saucepan over low heat, cook the spinach with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) water until wilted. Strain the excess spinach water into the cream mixture and set the spinach aside. Mix the remaining 1/2 cup cheese and the breadcrumbs in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.<br> Heat the broiler. Arrange the oyster half-shells in a casserole dish filled with seaweed or large rock salt. Place each oyster in a shell and add a bit of the cream mixture and some spinach. Top with the breadcrumb mixture. Broil until the cheese melts and the tops are lightly browned, about 1 minute. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Prosecco]&quot; 49187,&quot;Stuffed Snapper Veracruz 1/4 cup olive oil 1/2 medium red onion, julienned 1/2 cup julienned green bell pepper, seeded and membrane removed 1/2 cup julienned red bell pepper, seeded and membrane removed 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced 1/4 cup sliced green olives 1 tablespoon drained brined capers 3 cloves garlic, finely sliced 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1/4 cup dry red wine 2 cups fire-roasted diced tomatoes 3 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper One 3-pound pink snapper, whole, scaled, gutted Julienned bell peppers and jicama, for garnish 1/4 cup vermouth Crispy tortilla strips, for garnish Lime wedges, for garnish Mexican beers, cold, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add half of the oil to a large saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Once hot, cook the onions, bell peppers, jalapeno, olives and capers until just softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and sweat until just aromatic, about a minute. Stir in the tomato paste and deglaze with the red wine. Stir in the tomatoes and bring the pan to medium-high heat. Reduce until the liquid is almost evaporated, about 7 minutes. Fold in the oregano, mixing well. Continue cooking until the stuffing is a thick, pulpy consistency, about 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat.<br> Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool. Score both sides of the fish. Stuff the cavity of the fish, using about half of the stuffing; set the remaining stuffing aside. Secure with three evenly spaced lengths of kitchen twine.<br> Bring the remaining oil to medium-high heat in a large, nonstick skillet. Sprinkle the fish on both sides, and place in the skillet once the oil begins to smoke lightly. Sear until the skin browns on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a fish spatula, flip the fish gently, and then place the whole skillet onto the middle rack of the oven. Bake until the fish is golden brown, the flesh flakes easily and the stuffing is hot throughout, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the skillet and place onto platter with the julienned bell peppers and jicama, if desired.<br> Put the skillet back over medium-high heat and add the remaining stuffing. Deglaze the pan with the vermouth and stir to combine. Cook for about 1 minute. Remove the kitchen twine from the fish. Garnish the fish with the crispy tortilla strips, the stuffing and a squeeze of lime juice. To serve: Transfer portions to plates. Garnish with lime wedges and serve with a nice, cold Mexican beer. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 49188,&quot;Spaghetti Western 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more if needed 1/2 pound ground beef 1 small Vidalia onion, diced 2 celery stalks, diced 1 carrot, diced 1/2 cup chicken broth 1(8-ounce) can tomato puree<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup canned black beans, rinsed and drained 1/2 box dried spaghetti pasta (about 8 ounces) Red cl pepper flakes, for garnish Grated pecorino, for garnish Grated Cheddar cheese, for garnish Fresh basil, sage and parsley, chopped, for garnish Instructions: Heat a large saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil.

Add the onions and a large pinch salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to turn translucent and release their liquid, about 10 minutes. Add the diced bell peppers, adobo and bouillon cubes. Add another 1/4 cup oil if the bottom of the pot looks dry. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bell peppers start to break down and the mixture resembles a dark red-orange soup, about 10 minutes. The heat should be low enough and there should be enough oil so that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. Add the leeks, scallions, 3 tablespoons salt and remaining 1/4 cup oil if necessary. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables break down, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and capers, stirring occasionally, until the mixture resembles a slaw tossed in a bright brick-red barbecue sauce and some oil, about 10 minutes. Once the vegetables have softened and become a homogenous mixture, add both wines, the mustard, Worcestershire and dissolved panela and stir together. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Taste and add more salt, if necessary. Add the pork and beef to the vegetables, stir to combine and bring to a very low simmer. Cook, covered, about 15 minutes. The beef and the pork will have released some juices, so stir to evenly combine everything and redistribute some of the meat from the bottom of the pot to the top. Cover and cook at a low simmer for another 30 minutes. I like to put my ear close to the lid every 5 to 10 minutes. If I hear aggressive bubbling inside I lower the heat so the meat doesn&#39;t get tough. Once the 30 minutes are up, taste a piece of beef. It should be tender and fall apart when bitten. If it is still a little tough, cook for 5 to 10 minutes more. If you are doing the process all in 1 day, transfer the guiso to a bowl so it cools faster. If you are spreading out the process over a couple of days, divide the guiso into smaller containers, let cool a bit, then cover and refrigerate overnight. For the chicken: Put the chicken in an Instant Pot? or pressure cooker (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add 7 cups water, the bouillon cubes, a large pinch salt and the reserved leek tops from the guiso. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set the meat setting to medium, turn off the Keep Warm button if you have one and let cook. (If there is no meat button or you are using a standard pressure cooker, pressure cook for 15 minutes.) After the cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for\\u202fnatural\\u202frelease and wait until the\\u202fnatural-release cycle is complete. Remove the chicken to a medium bowl and let cool slightly. Strain the liquid into a large saucepan and reserve 7 cups for the masa. Tear the chicken apart into 1/4-inch chunks and set aside for garnish. For the plantain leaves: While the guiso and chicken cool, carefully rinse the plantain leaves, then open them up like a book or pamphlet until you reach the center and are looking at one smooth leaf. The goal is to divide the leaves into three categories: mains, supporters and strips. Or as we call them: las primeras (the firsts), las segundas (the seconds) y las fajas (the strips). The mains are the leaves that will directly touch the masa and that you will use to fold the masa over itself. They must be strong and, therefore, can\\u2019t have any holes. Sometimes you\\u2019ll buy bags of leaves that will be whole and you&#39;ll be able to cut them to your desired size; this is the dream scenario. But, other times, the leaves will have many tears, so arranging them is a bit of a puzzle. Assuming the leaves are roughly the same length, cut each main leaf into a rectangle about 15 inches long; each supporter, about 13 inches long; finally, each strip, ideally 3 to 4 inches wide (just throw the leftover pieces here). You need at least 25 of each, but realistically you\\u2019ll end up with just enough mains and lots of supporters. Sort the leaves into 3 stacks by size, then gently wipe each one dry with a cloth and remove any remaining dirt. At this point, my father, the plantain leaf king, wraps 2 cutting boards in plastic wrap: a large rectangular one that&#39;s bigger than the largest leaf rectangle; and another that&#39;s about a 10-inch round. These will act as a masa press (wrapping them in plastic wrap helps the dough release easily and prevents staining). You&#39;ll also need what we call a \\u201cmu?equita\\u201d (\\u201clittle doll\\u201d), which is a clean rag for greasing the plantain leaves. Take a rag (cheesecloth works here, too) and create a little ball at one end about 1 1/2-inches wide, then tie it off with kitchen twine, leaving some fabric to use as a handle. For the masa: Add 3 tablespoons salt to the saucepan with the chicken broth and heat over medium heat until slightly hot (the hotter the better, but not so hot you can&#39;t knead the dough when it&#39;s added to the masa), 2 to 5 minutes. It should taste like a salty chicken soup. This is what&#39;s going to season your masa! It needs to be flavorful. Meanwhile, heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the annato in a small saucepan over medium heat until the oil turns a beautiful red-orange, about 2 minutes; keep an eye on the seeds so they don&#39;t get dark and burn. (The annatto oil stains forever so be careful and use gloves when working with the oil and the dough). Strain the annatto oil into the warm chicken broth and stir to combine. Return the seeds to the small saucepan and set aside. This next part is best done with two people: one to drizzle in the annatto broth and one to hold the bowl steady and knead the dough with gloved hands. If you are the drizzler, please know that your job is equally important. (I have been trying to get promoted to kneader for years now, so I can sympathize.) Working in sections, add about 1 cup of the broth to a corner of the cornmeal in a large bowl. Pause and let the kneader (don\\u2019t forget those gloves!) incorporate the broth until worked into that section of the cornmeal. Taste a little bit of the dough. Is it flavorful? Or does the broth need another pinch or two salt? Let the kneader rotate the bowl; add another cup of the broth and repeat the drizzling and kneading process 2 more times, incorporating more broth into the dryer parts of the dough each time (for a total of about 4 cups broth), then combine and knead them together.<br> Once there are no visible grains of cornmeal left, combine all the dough together evenly before adding more broth. My mother kneads it all into a large ball, then flattens it against the bottom of the bowl and pokes holes throughout so that when the broth is drizzled in it doesn\\u2019t go straight to the edges. Once you have about 3 cups of broth left, transfer the dough to a large roasting pan and continue to knead there. Don\\u2019t do this on a counter or a cutting board\\u2014it will stain. Repeat the process of working the dough together, poking some holes and adding about 1/2 cup of broth 5 more times. (You likely won\\u2019t need to use that last 1/2 cup of broth but it\\u2019s good to have.) After adding the fifth 1/2 cup, the dough should get wet enough that it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan a little bit, but once you continue to work it and the dough absorbs the liquid, nothing is left behind on your hands or on the pan. Grab a handful of dough, roll it into a ball and then flatten it. If there are cracks on the side, you need a little bit more liquid. If there are none, you are set. It should feel like a very malleable and soft Play-Doh. Weigh the dough and divide by 25 (or 24 if you\\u2019ve been snacking on the dough too much like some people in our household are known to do). Our sweet spot for each portion is between 105 and 112 grams (a little under 4 ounces). Do not go below 100 grams. Divide the dough into equal pieces and roll into balls. Take your time with the rolling; the rounder the balls, the rounder they will be when they are flattened. Cover with a wet dark kitchen towel to keep the dough from drying out. For the assembly: Add the shortening and remaining 2 tablespoons annatto seeds to the drained annatto seeds in the small saucepan. Heat over low heat until the shortening melts and turns a deep red color, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. If the shortening starts to solidify while wrapping the hallacas, melt over low heat until smooth again.<br> Cut kitchen twine into 25 lengths, each about 52 inches long, and set up the following stations:<br> Dough flattening: the plastic-wrapped cutting boards, annatto shortening, la mu?equita, the \\u201cmain\\u201d plantain leaves and a stack of plates.<br> Filling: all of the garnishes including the guiso, bell pepper slivers, chicken, raisins, almonds, capers, olives, bacon, dried plums.<br> Wrapping: \\u201csupporting\\u201d plantain leaves and strips. Tying: the twine.<br> You\\u2019ve made it to assembling! This is my favorite part. At this point we grab our adult beverages of choice, settle into our stations and turn on gaitas (Venezuelan equivalent of Christmas carols). We also boil a pot of water because it is mandatory to taste hallacas when you are done assembling.<br> Your first person will start by placing a \\u201cmain\\u201d leaf, smooth-side up, on the larger wrapped cutting board. Hold the mu?equita by the excess fabric and dip the little ball into the melted shortening, then generously grease a 9-inch round onto the center of the leaf. Place a masa ball in the center of the round and flatten with the smaller cutting board until an 8-inch round forms. Put your weight into it! Transfer the leaf with the disk of dough to a plate and pass it off to the filling station.<br> The filler will add a little less than 1/2 cup guiso in a straight line on the masa that lines up with 2 of the opposing diagonal corners of the leaf, leaving an inch on either side of the round. Think of this as a burrito that you are going to fold up, so everything needs to be slightly rectangular and in the center with room to fold. Place 1 bell pepper slice on each of the long edges of the filling. Then take a four-finger pinch each (in this order) of chicken, raisins, almonds and capers and sprinkle over the guiso. Top with 2 pieces of the bacon and place 4 olive halves throughout. Top with 2 dried plums, one on each short edge. Pass the plate to the wrapper. The wrapper will grab a corner of the leaf that&#39;s perpendicular to the line of filling and fold it over and peel the masa off slightly to cover half of the filling lengthwise. Repeat on the other side so the masa overlaps with the first half and the 2 sides of the disk meet each other in the middle. You should have a rectangle of masa rounded off on the short sides, diagonally in the center of the plantain leaf. Using each short side of the leaf, bring in the corresponding short side of the masa to try and cover the edges of filling that are visible. Carefully peel off and pat down the short sides so that the dough sticks to itself and completes the rectangle. Ideally, the filling should be covered but it&#39;s not a big deal if it isn&#39;t. Next, wrap the dough in its \\main\\ plantain leaf like you would a present: Fold over 1 corner of the leaf toward its diagonally opposing corner and create a \\crease\\ at the bottom (this is why you went diagonal with the filling). Repeat on the other side to enclose the dough lengthwise, then fold over the 2 short sides to create something that resembles an open envelope with a triangular flap. Close the envelope by tucking that triangular flap underneath until you have a perfect rectangle. Transfer the rectangle, flap-side down, to the smooth side of a \\u201csupporting\\u201d leaf, placing the rectangle in the center on a diagonal. Wrap the rectangle, making sure that the edges in particular are well protected; then snip off any protruding triangular flap. The name of the game here is: Keep water from getting into the masa. Once you fold the final flap, stick a strip in the opening and wrap it crosswise around the middle of the rectangle to complete the seal. Pass the hallaca off to the tyer and return the plate to the first station. Tie the hallaca also like you would a present. We like 2 rows each of twine going lengthwise and crosswise, which creates a 3 x 3 grid of twine. Repeat the wrapping and tying and don\\u2019t forget to toss your first couple of hallacas into the boiling water, which brings me to the cook! Cook the hallacas in rolling, boiling water until the smell of plantain leaves fills up your kitchen, at least 1 hour. Freeze any hallacas you don&#39;t cook in sealed plastic bags (we like to double up the bags) for up to 6 months. If you\\u2019re cooking them from frozen, boil them in batches for 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Once the hallacas have cooked, remove them to the sink with tongs or a large slotted spoon and carefully open up the leaves. If the leaves were well greased, the hallacas will slide off easily. Be careful, since they will be very hot. Try to place the hallaca seam-side down on the plate, if possible, as the top is usually much prettier. Serve immediately. Stir to combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl.\\u202fUse on chicken, beef, pork, rice or vegetables and grains.

Add a third of the whipped cream and fold lightly to combine; add the remaining whipped cream and fold gently, turning the bowl, until the mixture is homogeneous and no streaks of white remain. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a shallow dish, pressing on the ginger to remove as much liquid as possible. Add the limoncello to the syrup and stir to combine. Briefly dipping both sides of half of the ladyfingers into the ginger-limoncello mixture (to moisten the cookies but not soak them), line the bottom of an 8-inch (20-cm) square baking dish or cake pan with 6 ladyfingers in 2 rows, trimming the edges to fit if necessary. (Place the trimmings in a small bowl and steal a spoonful of the filling to dollop over them and enjoy as a private little cook&#39;s treat.) Pour half of the lemon cream mixture into the pan, and with a small offset spatula, spread the filling evenly over the ladyfingers. Repeat with the remaining ladyfingers, trimming them exactly like the first layer; you may need to flip them over in the syrup in order to dip both sides once the syrup begins to run out. Spread the remaining cream over the top. Lightly cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. To serve, slice with a warm dry knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 49266,&quot;Caponata \\Agrodolce\\ (Sweet and Sour) 1 cup olive oil, for frying, plus more if needed 3 medium eggplants, cut into small dice 3 small green zucchini, quartered and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 3 small yellow squash, quartered and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 2 onions, chopped 1/4-inch pieces 6 celery ribs, cut into 1/4-inch slices 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 1/2 cups red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1 cup roasted red peppers, thinly sliced 1 cup kalamata olives, pitted and chopped 1 cup capers Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 2 cups prepared marinara sauce Instructions: In a very hot pan, separately cook the vegetables over a medium-high flame with a bit of the olive oil.

Close the lid and secure it with duct tape, making sure the can is completely sealed. Shake the mixture lightly to combine. Place the sealed can into an empty 3-pound coffee can with a lid. Put on rubber gloves to protect your skin from the ice and salt. Add the ice around and on top of the sealed can, so the can is completely encased in ice. Pour 1 cup of the rock salt over the ice. Close the large can with the lid and secure it with duct tape. Place the large can on its side directly on the floor or a yoga mat, if desired (see Cook&#39;s Note). Roll the can back and forth, making sure to make a full rotation with each roll, about 20 minutes. The rolling is easier with a partner, but it can be done alone. Open the large can and discard the ice and salt. Rinse the small can with water; this will help keep any salt from getting in the ice cream. Open the small can. The mixture should be partially solid with some liquid with crystals forming. Use a large metal spoon to scrape any solids that have accumulated on the sides and bottom of the can and stir them into the rest of the mixture. Seal the small can again with the lid and duct tape. Refill the large can with ice and the remaining 1 cup salt. Seal the large can again with the lid and duct tape. Roll for another 15 to 20 minutes. Open the large can and discard the ice and salt.

Combine flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to 2 to 4 times, then add butter and pulse 8 to 10 times, until texture looks mealy and no large lumps of butter remain. Pour on water and pulse 5 times. (At this point, the mixture should hold together when squeezed.) Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and draw the plastic up around it, squeezing and pressing the dough into a ball. Flatten into a 1-inch-thick disk and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap and place on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper. Dust the top of the disk with a small amount of flour and top with a second sheet of parchment. Roll dough out into a round 1/8-inch thick. Use a 5-inch biscuit cutter and cut 6 circles out of the dough. Re-roll once if necessary. Remove the brioche molds from the freezer. Line 6 of the molds with the dough, being careful to press the dough into all the nooks and crannies. Gently run the rolling pin over the tops of the molds to trim the edges. Nestle each of the empty brioche molds inside the molds with the dough. Place the sandwiched molds in the freezer refrigerator for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and position a rack in the center of the oven with a second just beneath it. Remove the sandwiched molds from the freezer. Place them, inverted, directly on the center rack with a sheet pan on the rack below to catch any butter that might render out. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the molds from the oven. Flip right-side up and remove the top molds. Turn the oven up to 400 degrees F, return the tart shells to the oven and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Remove the tart shells from the oven and let cool completely on a baking rack before removing the shells from the molds. For the lemon filling: Whisk egg yolks until light in color in a medium nonreactive bowl and set aside. Whisk cornstarch, sugar, water and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and temper the yolks by slowly adding the hot starch mixture to them in a steady stream, whisking constantly, until a third of the starch mixture has been worked into the eggs, then return that mixture to the saucepan. Whisk in the butter and continue heating until just boiling. Stir in the lemon juice and zest, reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until mixture returns to a boil. Cook for 1 full minute more, then transfer to a medium bowl over an ice bath. Cool, stirring occasionally, until the curd is just slightly warmer than room temperature. (Do not chill or cool completely, or the curd will become difficult to spread.) Pour or use a pastry or zip top bag with the corner cut off to pipe the mostly cooled curd into the tart shells until flush with the tops of the shells. Cool filled tarts completely on a baking rack while you make the meringue topping. For the meringue: Whisk together the egg whites until foamy, then add the sugar, cream of tartar and salt in the heat-proof bowl of a stand mixer. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk constantly until the mixture reaches 165 degrees F. Then return the bowl to the base of the stand mixer and whip the egg whites on medium-high speed until medium-stiff peaks form. Increase the speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe the meringue to cover the top of the cooled tarts. Brown the meringue under a preheated low broiler, about 1 minute, or with a kitchen torch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 49290,&quot;Apple Pancake 4 medium apples 5 tablespoons butter or margarine 6 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 2 eggs, beaten 1/2 cup milk 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon melted butter 2 tablespoons icing sugar, divided Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Put the butter and granulated sugar in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula as needed, until the ingredients are fully combined and the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the brandy, vanilla and egg yolks and mix until just combined, about 30 seconds.<br> On low speed, gradually add the flour mixture, mixing until the flour is fully incorporated. Mix for about 1 minute.<br> Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and place them onto 2 separate pieces of plastic wrap. Shape each piece into a smooth disk and wrap tightly. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour.<br> Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Unwrap one piece of dough and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough to about 1/4 inch thick. With a 2-inch round cutter (plain or fluted), cut out about 20 circles and transfer them to the prepared baking sheets. Bake on the middle rack, in 2 batches if necessary, until golden brownish on top, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes. Repeat the rolling, cutting and baking process with the second dough piece, for an additional 20 cookies. Reroll the scraps once, cutting out 12 more circles, and bake. For the Mexican cajeta: Stir together the milk and sugar in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the vanilla extract, salt and vanilla bean pods and seeds if using. Bring to a boil on medium-high heat while constantly stirring, 6 to 8 minutes.<br> When the milk comes to a boil, remove from the heat and add the baking soda. The milk will become frothy and rise. Keep stirring the mixture. Put the pot back on the stove over medium heat. Cook at a low simmer, stirring frequently to make sure that the sauce does not stick to bottom of the pan. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a low simmer. After 15 minutes, the mixture will be light golden brown. Remove the vanilla pods if using and continue cooking until the mixture is a rich brown and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups (it will resemble a thick caramel sauce at this point), about 30 additional minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and allow it to cool completely, about 20 minutes.<br> After the cookies and cajeta have cooled, flip half of the cookies upside down and gently spread about 2 teaspoons of the cajeta on each one (if the cajeta is too thick to spread easily after cooling, microwave it briefly to warm it up and loosen it enough to spread). Place another cookie bottom-side down on top of the cajeta on each and press to create a sandwich. Dust the cookies with powdered sugar before serving.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle a work surface and rolling pin with confectioner&#39;s sugar and roll out dough to 1/8-inch thick. Move dough frequently to prevent it from sticking and add more confectioner&#39;s sugar to the work surface and rolling pin as needed. With a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter, cut 72 dough rounds, re-rolling dough as needed. With a small heart-shaped cookie cutter (about 1 1/2-by-1-inch), cut hearts from the center of half the dough rounds. Place the rounds and cutouts about 1 inch apart on parchment -lined baking sheets. Bake until just set but not brown, about 6-8 minutes. Let cool on the pan slightly before transferring to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: In a small bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, butter, confectioner&#39;s sugar, and pomegranate juice until smooth and fluffy. Spread about 1 teaspoon filling on each round cookie and top with a cut-out cookie. Place a red candy heart in the center of each. Leftover filling can be used to sandwich the small hearts together. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in color. Add egg and milk and beat to combine. Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of the bowl. Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with powdered sugar. Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move the dough around and check underneath frequently to make sure it is not sticking. If dough has warmed during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes to chill. Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie sheet halfway through baking time. Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack. Serve as is or ice as desired. Store in airtight container for up to 1 week.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until soft peaks form. Turn the machine up to high, and beat in the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar, continue to beat until shiny but not stiff. Add the flour to the yolk/sugar mixture and whisk to combine. Add l/4 of the egg whites to the yolk mixture, whisking to lighten the mixture. Then return the yolk mixture to the egg whites, and fold gently. Scrape into the prepared pan and even the top by running a long offset spatula across the surface. Bake until cake is golden brown and springs back when lightly touched, l2 to l5 minutes. Cool on a rack. Set aside. Place cooled hazelnuts on a kitchen towel and rub together to remove skins. Place the skinned hazelnuts in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process for l minute. Add the hazelnut oil through the feeder tube and process until a paste forms. Melt chocolate in a medium bowl placed over simmering water, or melt in a microwave oven. Add the melted chocolate to the hazelnut paste and set aside. Whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Fold in the hazelnut/chocolate mixture. Keep covered in the refrigerator until needed. To assemble the cake roll: Trim the edges of the sponge cake. Place the Hazelnut mousse on the cake layer. Spread the mixture evenly over the cake, leaving a l inch space along the long side. Using the parchment paper to aid you, carefully roll up the cake into a thick log, enclosing the mousse. Leave the wrapped, rolled-up cake on the sheet pan and refrigerate until filling is firm, at least 2 hours. Melt the chocolate. In a small pot, heat the coffee and cocoa. Add the sour cream. In the bowl of a mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and creamy. Add the chocolate mixture and combine completely. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside until of spreading consistency.; Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Line l or 2 baking trays with parchment paper and set aside. Fit a large pastry bag with a #4 or #5 plain tip and set aside. Beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy. Turn speed to high, slowly pour in half the sugar, add vanilla and continue to beat for l minute. Slowly pour in the remaining sugar and beat until the whites are very thick and shiny, about 3 to 4 minutes longer. Immediately spoon half the mixture into the prepared pastry bag. (Meringue will begin to break down if not used soon after it is ready.) Hold the pastry bag upright over the prepared baking trays, squeeze out 26 to 30 mushroom caps, making different sizes, placed about l inch apart. The caps can be different sizes, since real mushroom caps are never identical. Again, holding the bag upright over the other tray, lifting the bag as you squeeze out the meringue, form 26 to 30 stems, each l/2 inch to l inch high, placed about l inch apart. Place the trays in the oven and bake until the meringues are firm to the touch and can be lifted easily from the trays, about l l/2 hours. The meringues should be dry, but should not take on any color. Remove the trays to a cool dry spot. When cool, with a small knife, trim any pointed tips on the caps and stems, if desired. Melt the chocolate in a small bowl, and holding the caps upside down, spread a little chocolate on each one. Attach a stem and leave them upside down until the chocolate hardens. When ready, turn mushroom cap side up, and dust lightly with sifted cocoa. Set aside until ready to use for decoration. To decorate and serve: Remove pan with cake from refrigerator and place wrapped cake on a firm surface. Carefully unwrap cake. Using a serrated knife, from one end cut a 2-inch piece of cake on the diagonal. Set the cut piece aside. Cut out a piece of cardboard the length and width of the cake. Cover the cardboard with foil and place the cake on it. Spread a little frosting on the bottom of the small cut piece and set on top of the cake roll. Using a small spatula, spread the frosting over the entire cake as well as the small piece atop the cake. With a wooden skewer or the point of a small knife, make furrows to simulate bark along the sides and top of the cake. Arrange Christmas greens, plastic holly, and Meringue Mushrooms around the Yule Log. Sift powdered sugar over the whole thing to simulate snow. Fresh cranberries can be scattered around for added color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 49345,&quot;Smashed Cucumber Salad with Mint 6 Persian cucumbers Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, finely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons za&#39;atar<br> 2 radishes, thinly sliced<br> Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the cucumbers in a large ziptop bag and smash them with a heavy skillet.

Whisk in the cream and milk and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, about 10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Transfer the cream mixture to a heatproof bowl and add the mint. Set the bowl over a bowl of ice water to cool the mixture down quickly and stir occasionally until cool; discard the mint after 5 minutes. (Don&#39;t steep the mint for too long or it will impart a grassy flavor; a quick steep while the cream cools will do.) Cover the mint cream and refrigerate about 4 hours, or until completely cold. Freeze the mint cream in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions until frozen. Meanwhile, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, set it over a saucepan of simmering water and stir the chocolate until it has just melted. Remove from the heat and cool until the chocolate is barely warm and still fluid. Transfer the gelato to a large bowl set over a bowl of ice. Working quickly, drizzle the melted chocolate into the gelato while whisking or stirring vigorously. The chocolate will flake apart as it hits the cold gelato, forming bits of chocolate throughout. If you prefer larger pieces of chocolate throughout the gelato, use a wooden spoon to slowly stir in the melted chocolate. Serve immediately, or transfer to a container and freeze until firm, 3 to 4 hours.
