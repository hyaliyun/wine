Initially, there still is the spectre of yeast but with some time there are hints of burnt sugar and apricot compote, too. A lovely, engulfing apple tartness makes this as suited to baked fruit desserts and fruit tarts as to creamy, ripe cheeses. Full marks for poise and freshness.

It's lacking in freshness so enjoy it now.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"fr","description":"This shows both the fruit of the vintage and a more structured tannic side. Black currant flavors are up front, offering a generous feeling. They are balanced by the backdrop of tannins and tight acidity. Together they make a wine that is concentrated and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2016.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"cl","description":"Morande is the biggest producer of Pinot Noir in Casablanca Valley, and this entry-level bottling is a good value to boot. Earthy, forest-fire aromas coat black cherry notes in the bouquet; the palate's bark, oak and bacon flavors come from time in old American oak barrels. Creamy and simple, but a steal.","province":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This Pinot is all about brisk acidity and ripe, jammy fruit. The flavors of raspberries and cherries, enriched with oak, are direct and luscious, and will drink well now with a great tuna or beef steak.","province":"California"},{"country":"il","description":"Aromas of blackberry and cured meat give way to flavors of black cherry, dark plums, fennel bulb, lavender, thyme and a hint of smoke. This wine is surprisingly bright considering the depth of flavor and strength of its chewy tannins, with acidity that holds its own right into the orange-zest finish.","province":"Judean Hills"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a ripe, fruity wine, well textured and full of rich fruit. It has delicious acidity as well as a lively, fragrant aftertaste. This is ros√© both for the table and as a refreshing ap√©ritif.","province":"Provence"},{"country":"US","description":"This perfectly embodies the fruit-forward, irresistibly delicious wines of the 2012 vintage in the Willamette Valley. Along with lively aromas of pepper and spice come brambly fruit flavors of just-picked raspberries and black cherries. It rolls into a lush finish with a streak of espresso.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"With vines forming part of the 22-acre Jessiaume estate, this vineyard‚Äîone of the better known of the Beaune premiers crus‚Äîhas produced a fine, rich wine in this vintage. Although there is plenty of young wood, the fruit is so rich and generous, with such fine potential. Give this opulent wine until 2022.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Aromas come off as quite green, with notes of jalape√±o pepper and garden herb mixed with cherry and vanilla. The palate brings broad cherry flavors. It provides appeal but the aromas and flavors seem a bit disconnected and the greenness proves distracting.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"fr","description":"Despite its recent vintage, this is a wine that is already tasting mature. The palate is layered with secondary flavors touched with floral perfume, intense acidity and a dry aftertaste. It's not for aging, so enjoy now.","province":"Alsace"},{"country":"es","description":"A whiff of red-apple skins, red plum and spice make for a reasonably clean and fresh nose. This feels plump but still vital. Pithy flavors of citrus and cantaloupe turn more pithy on the finish.","province":"Central es"},{"country":"ar","description":"Regular but inviting, with good berry aromas and only a modicum of baked-fruit grit to the nose. The palate is solid and fruity, with lively, grapey berry and black-cherry flavors. Finishes smooth, with chocolate notes. Easygoing, simple Malbec from San Juan province.","province":"Other"},{"country":"ar","description":"Piattelli is an under-the-radar label that makes very good to excellent Malbec from old vines in Luj√°n del Cuyo, Mendoza. And the prices are more than fair. This wine is big and focused, with intense blackberry, chocolate and espresso qualities throughout. And the finish is midnight dark. Good through 2012.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Light but inviting aromas of lemon juice, apple flesh, ripe nectarine and crushed white rocks show on the nose of this bottling from Malibu. Sea-salt flavor appears throughout the palate, where pear and nectarine flesh meet with vanilla-butter-on-toast flavors. Nicely textured it's quite mouthwatering.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Feels sturdy and properly acidic, with melon, papaya and apple flavors running alongside almondy bitterness. Simple and quick on the finish; 60% Xarel-lo and 40% Chardonnay.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"Morocco","description":"Dark red-violet in the glass, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Grenache has a nose of black cherry, green pepper and cocoa. It may be a little too cool for some tastes, but bright fruit and slightly luxurious tannins make up for the fennel and eucalyptus flavors that are joined on the palate by cherry, pomegranate and orange zest. The smooth finish goes completely cool for a second but winds up in a burst of bright fruit.","province":"Zenata"},{"country":"it","description":"There's a citrusy, lemon soda quality to this wine that is backed by aromas of passion fruit, kiwi and mango. It's an easy, aromatic white with fresh zest and a friendly approach.","province":"Northeastern it"},{"country":"nz","description":"This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and edgy at first, but these characters should mellow with another few months in the bottle. It's boldly flavored, with black cherry and beet notes upfront, while subtle mocha and vanilla shadings emerge on the finish.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"bg","description":"Salmon pink in color, this ros√© has aromas of jasmine and dried rosemary. It is savory and acid-driven on the palate, with a pleasantly astringent finish.","province":"Thracian Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a stellar deal, so buy and drink up now. Lime blossom, ripe nectarine, lemongrass and wet gravel aromas show on the nose. The palate is focused and grassy, fleshed out with ripe stone fruit and layers of lime peel and rain-drenched cement. Elegant yet approachable.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a darkly fruity and spicy wine from a site overlooking the Marin Coastal range, often shrouded in fog. Planted to five clones, the site provides plenty of cardamom, clove, forest floor and black tea while allowing for a wildness of plum tart and crusty bread. The oak imprint is light.","province":"California"}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},D={class:"card-container"};function M(o,i,t,h,u,a){const p=y("PoemCard");return n(),r(c,null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",D,[(n(!0),r(c,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,f)=>(n(),m(p,{key:f,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(j,[["render",M]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/6.md","filePath":"drive/6.md"}'),z={name:"drive/6.md"},V=Object.assign(z,{setup(o){return(i,t)=>(n(),r("div",null,[w(P)]))}});export{F as __pageData,V as default};
