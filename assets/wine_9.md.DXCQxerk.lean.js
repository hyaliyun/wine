The finish is short and simple, but definitely in line with traditional Prosecco.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"The dryness hits you first, then the tannins. This is a Syrah that's hard and astringent, almost aggressive. But then the core of blackberries and cherries kicks in, turning spicy and licorice-like on the finish.

One to watch, if the winemaker can manage those bigtime tannins.","province":"California"},{"country":"za","description":"The smoked meat and spice on the nose of this consistently good Cabernet give it an exotic zan appeal, but the wine goes beyond merely unique.

This one, from a cool section of southern Napa Valley, is brisk in acids, making it rather closed now. But it has a gigantic core of blackberries, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate.

The vineyard was planted in 1915 and probably contains other varieties than Zinfandel. Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice.

Zinfandel hardly gets any better than this.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is one of the few California Syrahs that demands time in the cellar. Its tough tannins form an aloof astringency that makes it virtually undrinkable now, but it has an incredible core of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate fruit.

Now through 2012.","province":"California"},{"country":"pt","description":"Made from the D?o's very own white grape, this wine shows a fine balance between creamy, ripe yellow fruits, spice and a tense mineral streak.

A wild ramble through bushels of brambles, nettles and tangy red berries, this tastes like a mountain Zin, with some citrus and floral notes contributed by the Viognier.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a pure Cab Franc, stylish and varietal. The new oak was limited to just 30%, giving a kick to the natural toastiness of the grape.

The tannins have been beautifully managed.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Very rich and full-bodied, very voluptuous, this soft wine shows massive tiers of well-ripened black currant, plum sauce, mocha and cedar flavors.

Pair this citrusy white with shellfish or pasta con vongole.","province":"Northeastern it"},{"country":"US","description":"This stylish Cab is loaded with black olive and black fruits, all with a leafy edge.

An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"au","description":"In an unusual twist, Yalumba's m/g/s gives Mourvdre preeminence in the blend (60%), followed by 22% Grenache and 18% Shiraz. The result is a wine that lightens some of Mourvdre's dark fruit and tree-bark tendencies with a dash of raspberries.

This is a fine companion to the Merlot, but needs a juicy steak or rich sauce to cut the tannins.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"de","description":"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity.

The balance is just right, the stone yellow fruits giving ripe softness, while minerality and acidity provide the contrast.","province":"Bairrada"},{"country":"it","description":"This blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is almost too black, too concentrated and too extracted.

The cherry, cassis and chocolate fruit flavors are so powerful, they swamp the wine, leaving elegance behind and making it indelicate.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter.

The acidity is tight, opening slowly to blackcurrant flavors.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"US","description":"Tastes way too oaky at the moment, with a flood of vanilla, sweet charred wood and smoky butter flavors swamping the underlying fruit, which consists of blackberries and cassis. May be going through a phase of immaturity. Could well re-emerge after 2010, but its future is hard to predict, as it's made in a soft, Napa way, and these wines have yet to prove their longevity.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Very nice from head to toe.

The '04 is a giant step ahead of the '03, suggesting an increasing mastery of the grapes.

Should develop additional complexities by 2008.","province":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"Despite what seems like a soft, easy finish, this wine could use another year or two in the cellar to allow better integration of oak and fruit.

Smoke, spice and red-fruit aromas are perfectly interwoven, while the wine itself flows with agile zest.

It's a complex, pleasing wine for drinking now with upscale fare.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a big, extracted, dense wine whose muscularity makes it a bit too oversized now.

Cellar for 5C6 years, and it should be fine.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Good price for an upscale Chardonnay this rich and interesting.

Or delicious on its own, with fresh citrus, apricot and peach fruit flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"An edgy, mineral style, full in the mouth, with fruit flavors that definitely go towards pear and apricot and away from herbaceous. It's a great style that allows the wine to age, with a firm texture to go with the fruit.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This Sangiovese-dominated blend displays herb, olive and earth components wrapped around supple, well-modulated red fruits. This does not have the Sangiovese character that one finds in Tuscany, but it's a very well-made, food-friendly red blend that is drinking well right now.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"ar","description":"A joint venture between the Renacer winery of ar and cl and Allegrini from the Veneto in it. Thus it makes sense that this five-grape blend is done in the Amarone style, with concentrated, dried grapes. Aromas are generous, minty and floral, and the palate is jammy and concentrated. Rich and a little raisiny, just like Amarone. Drink now.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"pt","description":"A wine with good richness and weight, the crisp fruit softening into a more mature character, but still retaining a bright, tight acidity.

Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"it","description":"What stands out here is the purity and elegance of this wine's fruit-driven bouquet. This is a Rosso di Montalcino, but it drinks almost like a Brunello (which is by law aged more years in the cellar) thanks to its sophisticated style and integrated spice notes. The main difference is that you can taste the wine's youth here.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"es","description":"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing. The palate shows plenty of bright acidity and some heft and grab, while the flavors of dark berries and plum are accented by light herbal notes and other common Ribera accents like thyme and oregano.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"de","description":"This seems a bit simple and confected for an Erstes Gew?chs offering, with superripe, fruity aromas and flavors of apple, melon and lime.

Drily crisp, with a mouth-cleansing raciness, it offers complex flavors of citrus fruits, flowers and minerals, wrapped into a creamy texture.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Stiff, with a lot of green flavors (but not veggie); more like sweet pea matched against black raspberry with 40% new French oak giving it a toasty thrust. Unfined, unfiltered, with good grip and a finish showing a fair amount of dark notes.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This dark, muscular, toasty Cabernet is infused with rich coffee/mocha flavors right up front. Cassis and black cherry provide the counterpoint, and the wine sits comfortably in the mouth, without excessive heat or weight, despite its 14.9% alcohol. The finish falls away quickly, but this is definitely a wine hankering for a thick steak.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors.

Fortunately, the wine is thoroughly dry. But it's hot in alcohol, and too soft to age, so drink now.","province":"California"},{"country":"gr","description":"A lush nose of mocha, cinnamon, pepper and clove starts this smooth wine with style. Flavors of cedar, spice and rich fruit are complex and delivered in a mouthfilling, structured wave. A spicy finish adds to the appeal.

A blend of 50% Syrah and 50% Kotsifali.","province":"gr"},{"country":"pt","description":"A fine, ripe wine, with big, bold tannins, solid fruit and a structured black juice character.

Despite its lightness, it shows a lot of flavor and persistence, and it should benefit from a bit more bottle time.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Ripely fruity and soft, showing upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, tobacco, cola, mocha and pepper. Tastes a little sweet in charred wood extract.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"This is one of those awkward but deeply intellectual wines that won't appeal to everyone. Made near Gorizia, the wine shows a deep amber color with cloudy residue. Intense aromas focus on caramel, resin, candied orange peel, butterscotch and other resinous-oxidized smells.

Almond, pear and freshly creamed butter carry the palate, followed by an airy, simple finish that's fresh but once again, not overly flavorful. Basic Vernaccia to the core.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"From the winery's estate vineyard, in a cooler part of the valley south of Stags Leap, comes this dry, tannic, full-bodied wine. Far from a jammy monster, it has a bell pepper earthiness in addition to cherries and blackberries, and could develop some bottle complexities in a few years.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Aromas of cherry and strawberry are alluring, but the mouth is rock hard and very tannic.

It's fine for everyday, but lacks the intensity and vibrant acidity that typify Clare Rieslings.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Fans of oak and fruity tropical flavors will appreciate the price on this well-organized, everyday Chard.

From a low-production parcel of the estate, it routinely produces immensely concentrated wines.

The wine is rich and lush, with a fine balance of dusty tannins, crisp acids and direct blackberry, coffee and herb flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a ripe, lush wine, with high alcohol (16.3%), low acidity, and very forward flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, cocoa and spicy pepper. The fruit really stars in this dry blend of Cab, Syrah, Zin and Petite Sirah.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"This is a good table wine with sweet, woodsy aromas of sandalwood, clove, cinnamon and earth.

It's ripe enough in cherry, blackberry, plum and coffee flavors, with good tannins and acidity.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Decent everyday Zin, dry and spicy, with rich tannins and ripe dark berry, coffee and tobacco flavors veering into bitter dark chocolate. Nice with pasta in a tomato sauce.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Smells a touch green and pasty, and while the wine is deep and dark, there isn't a whole lot of definition or specificity to it.

It's nothing complicated, but entirely pleasant, so easy to like with, say, penne and sausage.","province":"California"},{"country":"gr","description":"A solid producer of Naoussa, Karydas has crafted a good Xinomavro  with this vintage. Aromas come on strong with lush purple fruit, violets, pepper and menthol, then pick up lemon, charred burger and distinctive earthy elements. Flavors of pomegranate, menthol and plum all have a meaty feel, while hard tannins are matched by firm acidity. More of a curiosity wine than one to consume over light conversation.","province":"Naoussa"},{"country":"es","description":"Fairly big and muscular, with black fruit, cinnamon and olive notes on the nose. The palate is beefy and deep, with plum and blackberry flavors. With big tannins and a full-bodied personality, this is not a lightweight.","province":"Central es"},{"country":"gr","description":"A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Limnio, this is a young wine with nice fruit but it's lacking in complexity.

A mineral, chalky feel coats the mouth, and the grapey flavors backed by blueberry pie don't diminish it.","province":"mk"},{"country":"es","description":"Some early pickle and sauerkraut aromas were worrisome until they completely disappeared.

A little funky and definitely not for everyone, given the wine's overt sweetness and oddities.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"es","description":"Not a complete swing and a miss, but nothing special despite the miniscule production and higher-than-normal price. The color is pale and the nose has some gaps. In the mouth, you get dry soda crackers and white-peach flavors. Finishes with lime and apple. No glaring faults but hollow.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"nz","description":"The 2004 vintage wasn't an easy one for Nelson Pinot Noir, and this wine reflects that. The aromas are slightly earthy and herbal, marked by tomato and beet elements, while the flavors are herbal to the point of mintiness but also fresh and appealing. Ultimately, it's an attractive effort destined for short-term drinking.","province":"Nelson"},{"country":"US","description":"Tastes like an Arroyo Seco white wine that's red, meaning the acidity and dryness hit you upfront, and also the purity of the fruit.

Best Buy.","province":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A saignee wine, where a portion of juice is bled off to produce a light, fruity wine that has little, if any oak. Apricot, peach and rose flavors drink dry and simple. The mouthfeel is light and airy, like silk on the palate.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Burnished gold in color, with aromas of custard, lemon curd, toast and baked apples.

A bit rustic. Enjoy with burgers or spaghetti.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Mixed with some Merlot, a tough, young wine with considerable tannins and a punchy, tart mouthfeel, like an old-fashioned jug blend.

Judicious oaking supports the fruit rather than overwhelming it, but this wine's clock is ticking.

Very fresh acidity helps boost the flavor profile and keep the structure keen and lively.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Plum and smoke aromas with pure cherry and strawberry flavors.

The tannins are a bit large, however, causing some drying on the finish.","province":"Languedoc-Roussillon"},{"country":"US","description":"Made in a straightforward, unoaky manner that lets the fruit through. Displays varietal flavors of lemons and grapefruit with tart acidity and a cleansing mouthfeel. Kind of thin, probably because the vines were stretched, but a pleasant enough sip.","province":"California"},{"country":"za","description":"This wine has simple aromas of fresh herbs and banana pith. The acidity is a likeable counterpart to one-dimensional tropical fruit flavors. Finishes with another dose of fresh herbs.","province":"Robertson"},{"country":"fr","description":"At first, the aromas are lean and mildly pickly, with just some cranberry popping through. On the palate, it's quite the same scenario: the first flavors are of green peppers and tangy berries. With time, however, things come together and those green, sour notes slip to the rear and are replaced by riper cherry, spice and modest tannins.","province":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"za","description":"Grassy aromas meet those of papaya and banana, while the palate displays similar tropical notes with citrus and grassiness. Light and thin throughout, this finishes with bitter herbs.","province":"Stellenbosch"},{"country":"nz","description":"A disappointing effort from this respected producer, the 2001 reserve has turned out unusually heavy and ponderous, with sweet, passion fruit-laced flavors that turn slightly metallic on the finish.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"From Mitch Cosentino's estate vineyard, a wine whose aroma is dominated by the perfume of well-charred oak, with vanilla overtones.

It's the type of wine that you want to be very good but which isn't quite up to it.","province":"Languedoc-Roussillon"},{"country":"fr","description":"With a fading, rather light color, it's hard to believe that this is only a few years old. In the nose, there's a slight burnt character, one of matchsticks and red pepper flakes. The palate, like the color, seems mature; it's soft and round, with a mix of oak and berry fruit. This wine is fine, if a little weak, but the real fault is that it has no signature feature. It's decent but just there.","province":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"The aromas suggest key lime pie topped with whipped cream and a sprinkling of white chocolate, but it?s surprisingly soft and featureless in the mouth. There are peach flavors, but ultrasoft acidity turns them syrupy. An aggressive overlay of oak only adds vanilla.

It's a fine example of what Washington can do with Riesling, bringing bright, sappy fruit flavors to vibrant acidity, complex sugars and a lingering liveliness on the palate. If this is any indication of what this vineyard (and Chelan in general) is capable of producing, Washington has found its next great Riesling appellation.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet.

There is no place to hide in such a wine, and this is stripped naked. The fruit leans to tart blueberry, wrapped in leaf and a bit of stem; tannins are chewy and the finish is light but complex, showing soy, smoke, tar and leaf.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"This is an earthier, less overtly fruity rendition of McLaren Vale Shiraz, but one that still has plenty of merit. It's reasonably round and supple in texture, with flavors of black olive that coat the mouth and persist nicely on the finish.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Pinotphiles will appreciate that this was 100% destemmed for fermentation.

Try decanting for a couple hours before serving.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This Chelan winery improves from vintage to vintage. This new Syrah is satiny and rich, with pliant flavors of mixed berry, cherry and stone fruit. The new oak adds smoke and toast, but the gamy, meaty and pungently herbal notes come from the grapes.

Still, there's a mild whiff of green to the nose and palate, which prevents it from achieving a higher plateau.

If you must drink it now, decant it; best 2008C2015.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Ripe and flashy, offering tiers of cassis, chocolate and charry new oak flavors, wrapped in sweet, smooth tannins.

Best now and through 2017, at least.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Nearly 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this firm young wine showcases Napa Cab at its best.

This wine's considerable sweetness is admirably buffered by ample acidity, while low alcohol adds to the impression of lightness and ease.

There's a little bit of toasted nut flavor, but only a small number of second year oak barrels were used.

Imported by William Grant & Sons, Inc.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"au","description":"Jim Barry's first Florita is a delicious wine with Meyer lemon aromas and a dry, smooth, austere feel. The first sip is an intense rush of green apple, pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon flavors; the second sip, it's demure, almost coy, in its minerality and auserity. Ever-changing, with a kaleidoscope of flavors and sensations. Drink now through 2020. Imported by Negociants USA, Inc. Cellar Selection.","province":"South au"},{"country":"fr","description":"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site. Smoke, citrus and toasted nuts round out the flavors, which finish long and complex. Delicious now, but should hold several years at least. Imported by Vintus LLC.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Wonderfully ripe, rich and lush with peaches and cream flavors. The Semillon, which comprises 72% of the blend, is from a warm site on the Wahluke Slope. It is fermented and matured in neutral French Oak barrels.

Exceptionally polished and deeply flavorful, this is one of Washington's very best white Bordeaux blends.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The blend is 90% Cab, 5% Merlot, 5% Cab Franc. Dense, firm and muscular, hinting at layers of cassis, berry, cherry, cranberry and more. A dark, rich and thick wine, layered with red and black fruits. The tannins are fine-grained and mouthcoating, and the fruit is intense with streaks of smoke, anise, herb, soy and baking chocolate. Complex and richly, densely layered. Will age beautifully.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a new brand for me, and they're off to a promising start with this dry, minerally Chardonnay. It packs a punch with upfront lemon and lime, passion fruit and pineapple flavors that are pushed forward by great acidity, while oak adds a fine appliqu. This wine is notable for its balance, elegance and sheer deliciousness.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"It's 100% Cabernet, sappy, supple, silky and lush. It coats the palate and saturates the tongue with wild berries and black cherries. The oak is well-integrated and the extra time in bottle has melded it all together. Some lovely spice comes into the finish, along with coconut, vanilla cream and chocolate. Thoroughly delicious.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"A crowd-pleaser that starts in fifth gear with generous smoky, cedar-like notes, vanilla, cherry, dill and white mushroom.

The main drawback is residual sugar. Once that sugar hits, the palate is discombobulated.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Vegetal and herbal, with disageeable aromas of canned white asparagus.

The mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial and slightly tense (in a good way), showing good acid spine, crisp citrus flavors and taut mineral accents.

Editors' Choice.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"The bouquet offers dazzling aromas, including pineapple, banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted nuts and butter.

The bouquet of apple cider, anise, and fragrant jasmine-like notes opens to a trim palate of green apple and toast flavors, and a taut mouthfeel.

Notoriously tight when young, this wine often opens incredibly with cellaring.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Tasters pegged apples, anise, crme br?le and cinnamon in the lively nose of this rich wineone that also sparked some controversy. The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak.

Nevertheless, the winning aromas and flavors kept the overall take positive.","province":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"This pleasant, medium-weight white from an Iberian grape shows why it has caught on among our adventurous Aussie cousins.

The wood is there, but it's such a delicate touch.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"The wonderfully bright, citrusy acidity pushes and brightens the citrus, melon and fig flavors. It's such an expressive wine, so bold and well-structured. No oak seems to have been added, but no matter, the wine is so rich, clean and fruity that it doesn't need it. Just brilliant California Sauvignon Blanc.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The vintage was a very good one for Calera, offering the heat needed for ripeness but the cool nights for acidity. Mills is a ripe, delicious wine with blackberry, cherry, cola, mint and spice flavors resting on a complex, multi-layered palate that finishes firm and dry. Supple now, it should drink well for ten years.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a classy package, and the wine lives up to it, showing extra dimensions of power and weight. The flavors are layered and unfold gracefully; apple to citrus to pineapple. Then it slides into stone, chalk and fennel, moving finally to a nicely etched, crystalline clarity as it slowly fades across the palate.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"There are tannins here, but they're so soft, polished and sweet that they help the wine glide down, adding a textural dimension to the cherry, blackberry essence, cola, coffee and oaky vanilla flavors. It's an expensive wine, but a really fancy one.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"La Grenouille, the frog, is a soft, creamy wine, but with a great waft of acidity, like biting into a green apple. The citrus element is there, but it's that apple flavor and texture that dominates.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"es","description":"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's roble designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"The oak stands out, giving this Pinot a vanilla, caramel and buttered cinnamon toast dominance over the underlying cherry jam fruit. Although the texture is nice and silky, the wine itself feels simple, especially at this price.","province":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"This Pinot Gris is marching to the beat of its own drum, with some funky aromas and toast notes along with lemon and pear fruit.

The concentrated cherry/berry fruit flavors roll into drying tannins, with some seed tannin bitterness.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a direct, drink-me-now fruity Zinfandel with the flavors of a raspberry-cherry granola bar. There's a sweet, roasted almond and brown sugar edge, with lots of black pepper.

Good for Torronts but with limits.","province":"Other"},{"country":"US","description":"The fruit is apricot through and through, concentrated and thick.

There is a great final acidity.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"es","description":"Aromas of cactus pad, green apple and jalape?o are true Verdejo, while the palate brings citrusy, melony fruit as well as chalky, minerally dryness. Tastes a bit like white grape skins, with tangerine and lemon on the finish.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark for a blush wine, with a crimson hue, and forward and heavy in flavor, too.

It envelops the mouth with nutmeg and almonds as well as white fruits and ripe acidity. It's delicious now, but there's structure to allow it a few years aging.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"ar","description":"Here's one heck of a black, saturated wine. Cola and tar aromas abound, while the palate is borderline medicinal due to its extreme ripeness. If you like a rich, sun-drenched red with heft and body, this is it.

Weighs in at a whopping 15.5%.","province":"Other"},{"country":"US","description":"This vineyard delivers a very smooth, soft, nicely textured Pinot Noir. Very ripe fruit leads into flavors of strawberry preserves dotted with milk chocolate. This is a silky wine, which offers flavor details in the Oregon herb-and-leaf mode. It sails through a very smooth finish.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"It's a mystery how, in such a hot vintage, Talley produced this dry, minerally, almost austere Chardonnay. When everyone else was getting mangoes, this wine shows flint along with lime zest and kiwi. Yet the mark of Rincon Chard always has been a steely stoniness. The oak regime is big, but the wine handles it with aplomb. Best now through 2008.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a new vineyard, co-owned by Talley.

The vibrant black cherry, cola, mint and dusty spice flavors are supported by a silky smooth mouthfeel and a rich, long finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is styled in a relatively mature, slightly oxidized fashion. It's round and full-bodied, with lots of oily, buttered-nut flavors. But it is not at all tired or tiring; an underpinning of crisp apple keeps it lively and fresh in the mouth. It drinks very well right now, as if it had been cellared for four or five years.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"fr","description":"Big, intense and ripe, this wine has great flavors of ripe apples, almonds and honey from the malolactic fermentation.

From the Roux domaine, it is finely crafted and likely to age for many years.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Tastes riper than Peachy's other '04 Zins, with alcohol close to 16%, and some Petite Sirah in the blend. The wine is enormous in blackberry jam, cassis and blueberry pie flavors. Fabulous, exotic and just delicious, with gobs of chocolate.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Rich and almost overpowering in ripe fruit, this is a wine that doesn't pull its punches. Masses of jammy blackberry, cassis, cherry, mocha and smoky pie-crust flavors, with significant tannins and a dry finish. Nothing subtle here, just pure, spectacular New World red wine.","province":"California"},{"country":"ar","description":"Chocolate and mint with the essence of coffee drives the bouquet. In the mouth, this Malbec-Merlot blend is ripe as can be, with cassis, blackberry and chocolate all making their mark. The finish is secure and mildly tannic, while the overall take is that this is a ribald, rich South American red.","province":"Other"},{"country":"ar","description":"This new wine from Donald Hess of the Hess Collection is a big, bold mix of black cherry and currants. It's ripe and cushioned by full tannins and a lot of spirit. The blend is 66% Malbec, 20% Cabernet and 14% Tannat from high-altitude vineyards in Salta. Will go nicely with steak and other meat dishes. A truly excellent, modern-styled Argentine red.","province":"Other"},{"country":"fr","description":"Perhaps the best-known of the Chassagne-Montrachet premier crus, Morgeot is a wine that delights the taste buds.

The wood, green fruit, spice and acidity already in fine harmony. There is a richness coming from the deep soils of the vineyard. Can it age?

Best to decant before serving.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"With its sandstone soil, the Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is equally suited to Pinot Noir as to Chardonnay. But it is able to produce fresh, fruity wines, like this one. A spice and citric blend dances on the palate.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"fr","description":"Producing some of the more refined wines of Meursault, Charmes also has the right amount of opulence. Louis Latour's wine brings out all the richness and ripeness; soft, generous and full-bodied and leavened with spicy wood flavors.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Much as I love the winery's La Paule, this tops it. There's more concentration and complex blueberry, mulberry, black cherry and plum flavors.

Acidity, minerals and lees star. But there's also a tremendous core of ripe tropical fruits, roasted hazelnut, marzipan, coconut macaroon and all sorts of interesting things. Cellar it for a while, then drink from 2007C2010.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the best Old School House in years.

The wine is beautifully proportioned and its richness is never heavy or fat.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"Perrires is often described as the greatest of the premier crus of Meursault.

Ends long, with pepper, spice and mineral notes.","province":"Rheinhessen"},{"country":"US","description":"What a great job Tolosa has been doing with Chard, and it's all about that Edna Valley terroir.

The overall impression is of a young, complex, fleshy Pinot that should hold and develop for five years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is one of those Chards that's more Burgundian than Californian.

This wine could age 3C4 years, but it is already delicious.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"In the Haida (native American) language, Qo-ne means friend. This Cab Franc-dominated red blend is friendly enough, with sappy red berry fruit punching through the slightly herbal tannins. It's a solid, middle of the road version of Washington Cab Franc, showing the tannic side of the grape, but also its plummy fruit and hints of cinnamon spice.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"pt","description":"A light wine, very floral, with aromas of honeysuckle. The dry tannins behind don't quite seem to match all these perfumes. But there is fresh fruit, and simple structure.","province":"Port"},{"country":"za","description":"A firm, spicy backbone gives this Shiraz heft, but it's balanced by juicy red fruit and soft floral notes that keep it from becoming too austere.

A touch of smoke adds character.","province":"Stellenbosch"},{"country":"US","description":"The Jack is Saviah's everyday successful red blend, and accounts for half of the winery's 7,000 case production.

All too often, the extra ripeness turns subtle nuances into thicker, less complex flavors. Barrel time adds butter and toast.

But somehow it seems less interesting than its cheaper sibling.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This dark, somewhat volatile reserve wine from the Hogue Cellars is trying to push the envelope, with mixed success. Small amounts of Syrah, Malbec and Cabernet seem to have pumped up the color and the tannins, without adding much in the way of fruit. Right now it's quite tight, and long airing does not improve it.

The wine shows an old-fashioned ruggedness and the kind of in-your-face tannins and grapeskin astringency you don't see much anymore. Yet it's massively fruity and will age well. Six to 10 years should soften and sweeten it, and it will hold for another decade beyond.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Fresh and vibrant, showing berry-cherry cola, tea, clove, vanilla and smoky flavors that are just delicious.

Duckhorn has been on a roll with Sauvignon Blanc, and this is the best yet. It's dry and refreshingly crisp in acidity, with delicious citrus, fig, honeysuckle, green apple and spice flavors.

This is your classic slightly herbal Carmenre, and in the folds you'll find soft berry fruit, copious oak and a certain creaminess that makes the mouthfeel plush.

But that's okay, because despite the wine's almondy, sugary aromas and flavors, it has the body and acidity to handle it all.

A big-production wine (270,000 cases) that satisfies.","province":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"The wine shows its 28 months in barrel with dark and smoky flavors infusing it from start to finish.

Modern and woody, but satisfying.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark, dry, tannic and a little hot, with enormously ripe plum, blackberry and coffee flavors, this Barbera combines old-time ruggedness with modern purity.

The bubbles are gentle and petite, and the flavors linger elegantly all around the tongue.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's top wine is a blend of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Malbec and the rest Merlot.

Distinctively and proudly Californian.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Complex scents suggest rosewater, dried cherry, raspberry and baking chocolate.

It's creamy in texture, rich and off-dry.","province":"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer"},{"country":"ar","description":"Always one of the best Malbecs for the money.

Welcome to Hawaii! This is like a mouthful of the tropics, with everything from coconut oil to banana waffles.

It's competent but not up to the gorgeous scents and flavors of the past four or five vintages.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"cl","description":"A direct reflection of cl's cool and wet '02 vintage.

As delicious as the wine is now, especially with decanting, it really will benefit from aging.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is Etude's inaugural bottling of this wine, a block designation from the estate. It shows not only classic Carneros quality, but something exotic. Dry and complex, the wine has cherry, cassis, raspberry and new oak flavors, with good acidity.

Youthfully great now, and should age effortlessly for the next 8 to 10 years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps.

About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Youthful tannins star in this young wine.

With some Petite Sirah and Carignan for complexity, it shows wild berry, exotic spice, coffee, leather and cola flavors. My quibble, and it's a fairly substantial one, is the heat and candied sweetness on the finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a robust, rustic wine, rich in dark berry and fruit flavors, thick in tannins and a bit sweet. It's the kind of wine to drink with easy fare.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Another innovatively packaged wine from Don Sebastiani & Sons, and if you know the Pinots from the east side of Salinas Valley, like Estancia's, this is much in that vein. It's light-bodied and silky, with easy cherry, cola, vanilla and spice flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A rusty color belies this wine's age, but it's still enjoyable, with firm flavors of cola and barnyard. Light yet viscous, with soft tannins.This should be drunk now.","province":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"Showing a translucent ruby color and a silky texture, this Zin is elegantly structured, with spicy blackberry, cherry and pomegranate flavors before a slightly raisiny finish.

Finishes chalky.","province":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"Tastes a bit lean, with currant, herb and coffee flavors that are wrapped in fairly hefty, dry tannins.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Does just what VR does across all varieties, offering up a ripe, varietally true Zin that's all about upfront fruit and spice. Finishes with a scour of dusty tannins.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A simple dessert wine that's sweet but not overly so, with ripe apricot, peach and pear flavors and a floral note of honeysuckle. There's quite a bit of acidity for balance.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Quite earthy, almost to the point of tasting like dirt. Instead of fruit there is tomato, beet and root; it's a charmless style of Pinot. Hard to understand the select part.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark red, with mushroom, red berry, earth and green bean aromas. Fairly light, and with high acidity, the wine shows earthy red fruit, blueberry and rhubarb along with a good dose of oak.","province":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"What you get with this wine is a lot of cherry pie flavor along with a fairly heavy, soft mouthfeel and some gritty tannins.
