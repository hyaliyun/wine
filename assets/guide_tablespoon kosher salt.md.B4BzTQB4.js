Cook the pancetta until it gets brown and crispy, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onions and crushed red pepper and toss to incorporate with the pancetta. Season with salt, to taste. Cook the onions until they are soft and very aromatic, about 7 to 8 minutes. While the onions are cooking, in a large bowl, combine the bread and the milk. Toss to combine and let sit until the bread has absorbed the milk and is very soft. Use your hands to get in there and really squish everything together. Reserve. Add the garlic to the pan with the pancetta and onion and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt, to taste, and saute until the mushrooms are soft and have let off their moisture, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in the spinach. Add the onion/mushroom mixture to the reserved bread and stir to combine. Add the pine nuts, provolone and Parmigiano-Reggiano, and stir to combine. Taste to make sure that the mixture is delicious and season with salt, to taste, if needed. Set aside. Lay the beef slices between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and gently pound with a meat mallet to flatten and even out the slices. Put about 1/4 cup of filling on 1 end of each of the pounded beef slices and roll up. Secure the rolls with toothpicks. Repeat this process with the remaining beef and filling. Coat a large, wide pot with olive oil and put over medium-high heat. Season the beef rolls with salt, to taste, and brown them on all sides. When the beef rolls are brown on all sides, remove them from the pan and reserve. Make the sauce in the same pot. Remove the oil from the pot that the beef was just browned in. Add a light coating of fresh olive oil and add the onions and crushed red pepper. Season with salt, to taste, and put the pot over medium heat. Sweat the onions until they are translucent and very aromatic, about 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for another 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and red wine, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes, and 2 cups of water and season with salt, to taste. Return the beef rolls to the pan and snuggle them into the sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the beef is very tender and flavorful, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the toothpicks before serving. To serve, arrange 2 or 3 braciole on each serving plate. Halve 1 or 2 rolls to expose the stuffing. Spoon on some of the sauce and garnish with Parmigiano-Reggiano and chopped parsley. Wow! That&#39;s a great braciole! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 65599,&quot;Red Wine Marinated Flank Steak 1 1/4 pounds flank steak, rinsed and patted dry 1 (1.06-ounce) packet zesty herb marinade (recommended: McCormick) 1 1/2 cups red wine, preferably Merlot 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, chopped Instructions: In a large zip-top bag, combine all ingredients. Squeeze out air and seal bag. Massage bag until well combined and marinade mix is dissolved. Marinate in refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour or up to 8 hours. Remove flank steak from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Oil grate when ready to start cooking. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Place steak on grate. Grill for 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium. Remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes. To serve, slice across the grain. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 65600,&quot;High-Tech Crackers 3 cups hard whole wheat flour, or more as necessary 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups warm water Grated Parmesan Cayenne Coarse salt Sesame seeds Cumin seed Instructions: Place the flour and salt in a food processor and process for 10 seconds to mix thoroughly. With the motor running, add the water in a steady stream, then process for 10 seconds longer. The dough should have formed into one large ball; if not, feel the dough: If it feels very sticky, add 3 to 4 tablespoons more flour and process briefly until a ball forms. If the dough feels dry and floury, start the processor again, add 2 to 3 tabespoons more water, and process until a ball of dough forms. Once you have a ball of dough, process for 1 minute more, no longer. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 30 seconds or so. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, and place two racks near the center of the oven. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the other pieces covered. On a lightly floured surface, with lightly floured hands, flatten a piece of dough with your palms. Then roll it out to a very thin rectangle or round, as even a thinness as possible to ensure even cooking. Gently lift the dough from your rollling surface and place it on a large baking sheet or pizza pan. Sprinkle on one of the optional toppings or leave plain. Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut through the dough to make rectangular crackers. (Don&#39;t worry if they are not all exactly the same size. Variations in size and flavor will make your crackers interesting.) Spray the dough lightly with water and place on the upper oven rack. Begin rolling out the next piece of dough, keeping an eye on the crackers already baking. (Crackers brown from underneath.) Check on them 2 1/2 to 3 minutes after they go in. As soon as the thinnest patches of the dough have started to brown, take them out. If necessary, continue baking, checking every 30 seconds, but it is better to take the crackers out a little early than too late. You will soon get a feel for timing and degree of doneness. Variables that affect timing are the heat of your oven and how thin you managed to roll out your dough. When they come out of the oven, some of the crackers will be crisp, while others will need a little time in the air to crisp up. Transfer to a large bowl, breaking up any incompletely separated crackers. Roll out the remaining dough, season, and bake. When completely cool, crackers can be stored in a well-sealed plastic bag or cookie tins for up to a month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 65601,&quot;Neapolitan Holiday Cookies Cooking spray 8 ounces almond paste 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1 cup sugar 4 large eggs, separated 2 cups all-purpose flour 20 drops red food coloring 12 drops green food coloring 1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam 1/4 cup apricot preserves 6 ounces dark chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 3 quarter-sheet pans (or three 13-by-9-by-2-inch jelly roll pans) with cooking spray. Line each pan with parchment paper and coat the paper with cooking spray as well. Place the almond paste in the bowl of a stand mixer. Break it up into small pieces with a fork. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment and add the butter and sugar to the bowl. Beat the mixture on high speed until light and fluffy, about 7 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium, add the egg yolks, and beat until incorporated. Turn the mixer off and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Clean the mixer bowl thoroughly and fit the mixer with the whisk attachment. Beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the batter until thoroughly blended. Transfer 1 1/2 cups of the batter to a medium bowl, then transfer another 1 1/2 cups of the batter to a second medium bowl. Add the red food coloring to one of the bowls and stir until the batter is tinted throughout. Add the green food coloring to the second bowl and stir until the batter is tinted throughout. Scrape each of the three batters into one of the prepared pans, using the spatula to spread the batter to the edges. Bake, rotating and switching the positions of the pans halfway through, until the edges are golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool in the pans for about 5 minutes, then invert onto cooling racks and allow to cool completely. To assemble, place the green layer on a large cutting board or a large inverted baking sheet lined with wax paper. Spread the raspberry jam evenly over the top. Place the yellow layer on top and spread with the apricot preserves. If there are large chunks of apricots, remove and chop them up to make them more spreadable. Top with the red layer. Cover with plastic wrap and place a heavy cutting board on top to weight it down. Refrigerate overnight. Place the chocolate chips in a microwaveable bowl and melt in the microwave on low power about 2 minutes. Spread the chocolate on top of the cooled cake and let dry slightly. Trim the rim of the cake with a serrated knife to make clean edges. Cut the cake crosswise into twelve 1-inch-wide strips, then cut lengthwise into 1 1/4-inch strips. The cookies will keep, covered, up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 65602,&quot;Grape Chicken Caesar Wrap 1 12-inch flour wrap/tortilla 1/3 cup California red seedless grapes, stemmed, halved 1/3 cup chicken breast, grilled, sliced 1 tablespoon creamy Caesar dressing 1 cup romaine lettuce, cut 1 tablespoon shredded parmesan cheese Instructions:</p><ol><li>Lay out wrap (heat if desired in a steamer or on a flat top) and starting on the lower third, layer ingredients in order listed.</li><li>Fold lower third of wrap up over filling and fold outer edges inwards to close the ends then continue rolling up to complete the cylinder.

Cut out both circles. Measure the circumference of the pan with string, then cut a long strip of paper the length of the string and fold in half lengthwise. Grease the pan with melted butter and place one of the paper circles into the bottom. Grease, then add a second circle and grease again. Press the paper strip onto the inside edge of the pan and grease. If you&#39;re making multiple tiers, repeat with the other pans. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Put the butter and sugar into a large bowl and beat together until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, vanilla, salt, and all-purpose flour to prevent the mixture from curdling. Add the cake flour, unsweetened cocoa, and baking powder and give it a final beat to mix together. Add the food coloring and mix well. Spoon into the prepared pan and bake for the recommended time (small 30 to 40 mins; medium 65 to 75 mins; large 75 to 85 mins). The cake is ready when firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes then turn out onto a cooling rack (you may need two racks side by side for the largest cake). Peel off the lining paper and let cool. Making the buttercream: Prepare the ingredients for the relevant number of tiers. You can make the buttercream in a single batch, so you&#39;ll need only one large bowl. Cream together the softened butter and confectioners&#39; sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the cream cheese and a few drops of vanilla extract to taste. Cover the surface of the buttercream with plastic wrap and chill until ready to use. Cutting and layering the cakes Using a long-bladed serrated knife carefully cut the smallest cake in half and sandwich back together with 3 heaped tablespoons of buttercream. Spread a teaspoon of buttercream onto the center of the smallest cake board and put the cake on top (this will stop the cake sliding off the board). Cut the remaining cakes in the same way, using 6 heaped tablespoons of buttercream to sandwich the medium cake and 8 heaped tablespoons of buttercream for the large one. Place the medium cake upside down on its cake board and the large cake on the largest cake board. Spread half the remaining buttercream in a thin layer over the top and sides of the cakes to cover. Refrigerate until set to the touch and then spread the remaining buttercream over the cakes to give a perfect finish. Covering with fondant Cut a piece of string for each cake to measure the combined length of the top and sides - this will be the size to which to roll your circle of fondant. Ice just one cake at a time, as fondant can dry out very quickly. Make sure your counter is clean and dry, then knead the fondant until warm and pliable. Place 2 tablespoons of confectioners&#39; sugar in a small sifter and use to lightly dust your counter. Roll out the fondant to 1/6in (3 to 4mm) thick and keep turning so that it stays circular. Carefully slide your hands and arms under the fondant, then lift centrally over the cake and lay onto the buttercream (you could use a large rolling pin for this instead - simply hold the pin over the center of the fondant and flip the paste over it. Lift, then position and roll over the cake). Dust your hands with a little confectioners&#39; sugar and rub them gently over the cake to make sure the fondant has stuck to the buttercream underneath. Use a sharp long-bladed knife to trim the edges, cutting downward cleanly (keep wiping the knife blade, or the paste will build up and make it difficult to get a clean cut). Repeat with the remaining cakes and fondant. Save any trimmings to make decorations, flowers, or frills - keep well wrapped in plastic wrap until ready to use, to prevent from drying out. Stacking the cakes To stack the cakes, you&#39;ll need the help of some dowel rods, because the sponge and frosting are too soft to support the weight of each other. Dowels can be bought from specialty cake stores; however, as every cake is different they do need to be cut to size. Only the bottom two tiers need them, so you will need eight rods in total. Hold a rod at the side of the cake and mark with a pencil where the frosting comes to. Cut the rod and three others to the same length. Push the rods into the cake about 2in (5cm) away from the sides, to form the four corners of a square in the center of the cake. They should not rise above the level of the frosting. If you have miscalculated and the dowel is too long, remove it and shave off any excess with a sharp knife. Measure, then cut and insert the rods in the same way for the medium cake. The three cakes can now be stacked directly on to each other. Once they&#39;re stacked, it&#39;s best not to move them about, so it&#39;s safest to assemble them at your venue or in the position you want them to be displayed.

Place the lid on the container and shake to dissolve the salt. Remove the pop-up thermometer, liver, gizzards, and heart. Cut off the wings. Using kitchen shears, locate the spine at the base of the neck. Cut up the line of the backbone towards the neck cavity. Turn the duck and cut straight towards the rear cavity. Remove the backbone. Turn the duck over and cut straight down the middle of the breast bone, leaving 2 equal duck halves. To separate the legs from the breast, flip your halves over so the flesh side is facing up at you. Using a knife, make a crescent shape cut between the leg and the breast. Lay your knife flat against the skin and make 3 marks in one direction and then in the other, making an X. Make sure that you are cutting through the skin and not the meat. Line the inside of a plastic lexan or a pot with a zip-top bag. Place the duck quarters inside the bag, and pour the brine over the duck. Seal the bag, ensuring that all air is removed from the bag. Brine the duck for 2 to 2 1/2 hours in the refrigerator. Bring 1 1/2 inches to 2 inches of water to a boil in a large pot. Place a colander into the pot and line the sides of the colander with the duck. Do not stack the duck quarters on each other. Cover and turn the heat to medium low. Steam the duck for 45 minutes. Set oven to 475 degrees F. Place a large cast iron skillet into the oven. Remove duck pieces from steamer and place legs, skin side down, into the hot skillet. Place the skillet into the hot oven immediately and cook the leg quarters for 10 minutes. Add the breasts, skin side down, and cook for 7 more minutes or until the duck takes on a deep mahogany color and the skin is very crisp. Remove the duck from the skillet and rest under foil. Add the chard and the shallots to the skillet. Toss the chard in the fat until it barely wilts. Season with the sherry or balsamic vinegar.

Arrange the pierogies snugly flat-side down in the skillet (there may be some overlapping). Cook until the bottoms just begin to brown, about 3 minutes. Pour in 1/2 cup of water and simmer until the pierogi dough is tender and the water has completely evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking until the bottoms are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more; watch carefully as they can go from golden to burnt quickly. Remove from the heat. While the pierogies cook, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, squeeze the sausage out of the casings into the skillet. Cook the sausage, stirring frequently and breaking it up into bite-size pieces, until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and pepper flakes and stir until the garlic begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Stir in the broccoli. Stir in the broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Sprinkle with the Parmesan. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by half and the broccoli is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.

For the BBQ marinade: Combine the pear puree, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice wine, pepper, schichimi togarashi and 5-spice powder in a 2-quart saucepan and mix thoroughly with a whisk. Cook over high heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Add the prepared garlic mixture, lower the heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the onion and scallion. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, remove any excess fat and sinew from the ribs. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer to a 4-quart container. Slowly pour the cooled BBQ marinade over the ribs and mix until thoroughly coated. Marinate the ribs in the refrigerator at least 8 hours. Drain the ribs and onion of excess BBQ marinade through a sieve or strainer. Heat the oil in a frying pan over high heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the ribs and onion and cook, mixing often to prevent burning, until caramelized and cooked to desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes for medium-rare, 3 to 5 minutes for medium. Serve on rice, bread or salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM blend]</p><p>&quot; 65634,&quot;Lemon Herb Orzo 1 cup orzo 1 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped 2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped Instructions: In a medium pot of boiling salted water, cook orzo according to package directions.

Spread each cheese slice with 1/4 teaspoon of the Dijon and set the slices mustard-side-up on a flat surface. Put the confectioners&#39; sugar in a small fine-mesh sieve set over a plate. Heat the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until melted and starting to brown around the edges of the pan. Add the egg mixture and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Working quickly, dip 1 slice of the bread in the eggs, then flip the slice and place it so the top edge of the slice is near the edge of the pan furthest from you. Repeat with the remaining slice of bread, setting it across the pan from the first bread slice. The bottom edges of the two slices should be in a straight line, with eggs all around.\\u202f Continue to cook the eggs until they are completely set on the bottom and mostly cooked on the top, 1 to 2 minutes more. Slide a large nonstick spatula under the bread and flip the whole omelet in one single motion. Set the cheese mustard-side up on top of the omelet, covering the bread. Lay the ham on top of one of the slices of cheese. Using the spatula, fold one side of the omelet (but not the bread side) over the cheese and ham, then fold over the other side. Fold in half so the bread slices meet and form a sandwich.<br> Cook until the bread on the bottom is golden brown and the cheese is beginning to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the heat if the bread begins to darken too quickly before the cheese melts.

Let the mixture steep for 1 hour in the refrigerator, then strain out the cereal and discard it, reserving the milk (there should be 4 1/2 cups). Add 4 cups of the cereal milk to a large saucepan and warm over medium heat until steaming (do not let boil), about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, egg yolks, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/2 cup cereal milk in a medium bowl. Slowly incorporate the warm cereal milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to keep the eggs from scrambling. Once combined, pour the mixture back into the pan and turn the heat to medium. Cook, whisking continually, until the mixture thickens up to the consistency of pudding, about 7 minutes. Remove the pudding from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Transfer to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap pressed against the top of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Chill the pudding completely, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread the remaining 1 cup cereal evenly on a baking sheet and drizzle with the agave.

In a roasting pan, roast chicken pieces until golden brown, approximately 1 hour. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside. Deglaze pan with approximately 1 cup of water by scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to lift up the brown bits. Transfer liquid to a large stockpot. Once chicken has cooled, separate the meat from the skin and bone and set aside in a bowl. Add bone and skin to stockpot. Pour 2 gallons water into the pot along with unpeeled onions, carrots, and celery. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and let simmer for 2 hours, covered. Drain fat, bones, and vegetables with cone strainer from the broth into a bowl and return strained broth to stockpot. Add peeled onion, salt, and pepper, to taste. Simmer for another 30 minutes or until onions are tender. Keep warm. Grate potatoes with either a hand grater or juice extractor. Measuring 2 cups at a time, scoop potato mush into cheesecloth and squeeze until all the liquid is removed. Do not discard liquid until measured for its volume. Place potato pulp into a large mixing bowl, while slowly stirring with a wooden spoon, add hot chicken broth measured to the same volume as the discarded potato starch liquid. Potato mixture consistency is correct when the wooden spoon just slightly falls over when made to stand up in the mix. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Both are autumnal, both marry well with the flavors of maple, spirits, and spice; but using sweet potatoes results in a denser, creamier texture. Originally created for an article in Fine Cooking magazine, this dessert is always one of my Thanksgiving pie offerings. I can&#39;t tell you how many people have said as they down the last crumb, \\and I thought I didn&#39;t like sweet potato pie.<br> This is like a sweet potato custard, and you will want to take care not to overbake the filling. Check it frequently as it nears the end of its baking time and remember that it will set up a bit as it cools. Serve this pie with some lightly whipped cream or, for a slightly twisted take on a tried-and-true Thanksgiving combo, garnish with some marshmallow fluff. 1 (9-inch) basic pie crust, baked blind, recipe follows Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Pierce the sweet potatoes at each end with a fork and place them on a foil-lined baking sheet. Roast until the potatoes are soft, about 1 hour, turning them over halfway through the baking time. Cool, peel, and put the flesh through a food mill or mash smoothly with a potato masher. You should have 2 cups of puree. Turn oven down to 375 degrees F. Combine the puree with all the remaining ingredients for the filling. Whisk until well combined and smooth. Pour the filling into the partially baked pie shell. Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes, until the filling is just barely set. When the rim of the pie plate is nudged, the very center of the filling should barely move. Cool the pie to room temperature. It can be made several hours or up to 1 day in advance. Place the flour, salt and sugar in the bowl of a food processor with a steel blade. Pulse to combine. Add the chilled butter and shortening; pulse until the fat is evenly cut in and the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Remove to a mixing bowl. Working quickly, gradually add enough cold water, while tossing and stirring with a fork, until the dough just begins to come together. Divide the dough into 2 even portions, flatten into rounds, wrap in plastic, and chill for a few hours or overnight. Roll out 1 portion and fit it into a 9-inch pie pan. Crimp edges. Reserve remaining portion for another use. Line shell with foil or parchment paper and fill with dry rice or beans. Blind bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven for 20 minutes.

Season with salt.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 65657,&quot;White Yeast Bread 2 teaspoons caster sugar (superfine) 2 cups warm water 2 1/2 teaspoons dried yeast or 3 1/2 ounces fresh yeast or .25 ounce fast-acting yeast 1 pound 10 ounces strong white flour (bread flour), plus extra for dusting 2 teaspoons salt 3 tablespoons butter or 4 tablespoons olive oil 1 egg, beaten, optional Poppy or sesame seeds, for the top of the loaf, optional Instructions: In a measuring cup, mix the sugar with a 1/2 cup of the warm water and yeast and let stand in a warm place for 5 minutes, or until frothy. If using fast-acting yeast, there is no need to let the mixture stand.<br> In a large bowl, sift together the flour and salt. Rub in the butter, and make a well in the center. If using olive oil instead of butter, pour the olive oil into the remaining 1 1/2 cups water. Pour in the yeast mixture and most of the remaining water (and the olive oil, if using). Mix to a loose dough, adding the remaining water if needed, plus extra if necessary.<br> Knead the mixture until the dough is smooth and springy to the touch, about 10 minutes. If kneading in an electric food mixer with a dough hook, 5 minutes is usually long enough. Put the dough in a large oiled bowl. Cover the top tightly with plastic wrap, and place somewhere warm to rise, until it is doubled in size. This may take up to 2 or even (on a cold day) 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> When the dough has more than doubled in size, punch down, and knead again for 2 to 3 minutes. Leave to relax for 10 minutes before you begin to shape the bread.<br> Shape the bread into loaves or rolls, and then transfer to a baking tray, and cover with a clean tea or dish towel. Allow to rise again in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes, until the shaped dough has again doubled in size. When the dough has fully risen, it should leave a dent when you gently press the dough with your finger.<br> The bread is full of air at this point, and therefore very fragile, gently brush the loaf with egg wash and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds, if using, or dust lightly with flour for a rustic-looking loaf.<br> Bake in the oven for 30 to 45 minutes for a loaf, depending on its size, or 10 to 15 minutes for rolls, Turn the heat down to 400 degrees F, after 15 minutes for the remaining baking time. When baked, the bread should sound hollow when tapped on the base. Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65658,&quot;Pears in Red Wine with a Fresh Cheese Filling 6 ripe Bartlett pears 1 (750 ml) bottle full-bodied red wine 1/2 cup sugar 2 cinnamon sticks 1 (1-inch) wide strip orange peel 3 ounces cream cheese 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon brandy 1/4 cup heavy cream, whipped 1 pint strawberries, tops removed 1/4 cup sugar Instructions: Pears: Peel the pears and core them whole using a melon baller to scoop out the pulp from the bottom. In a large saucepan, place the wine, sugar, cinnamon sticks and orange peel and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and add the pears. Simmer them for about 30 minutes until fork tender. Baste the pears occasionally to make sure they absorb the wine evenly. Remove the pears from the poaching liquid, remove the cinnamon stick and reduce the liquid to 1 cup. Set it aside to cool. Filling: Place the cream cheese, sugar and brandy in a food processor and blend. Transfer it to a bowl and fold in the whipped cream. Place it in a pastry bag with a plain tip and fill the pears. Place them in a shallow serving bowl and pour the reduced liquid over them. Chill. Sauce: Puree the strawberries with the sugar and chill. To serve the dish, cover the pears with the strawberry puree. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 65659,&quot;Individual Beef Wellingtons 4 (6-ounce) thickly cut filet mignons 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 (1-ounce) slices goose or duck liver, or pork country-style pate One-half (17 1/4-ounce package) frozen puff pastry (1 sheet), thawed Mushroom Duxelles, recipe follows 1 large egg beaten with 2 teaspoons water to make an egg wash 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 10 ounces button mushrooms, wiped clean, stemmed, and finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper 2 1/2 tablespoons dry white wine Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Season both sides of each filet with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the filets and sear for 1 minute on each side for medium-rare. Transfer to a plate to cool completely. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 14-inch square, and cut into 4 (7-inch) squares. Spread one-quarter of the mushroom duxelles on top of each filet and top each with 1 slice of the pate, pressing to flatten. Place one filet, mushroom side down, in the center of a puff pastry square. Using a pastry brush or your finger, paint the inside edges of the pastry with egg wash. Fold the pastry over the filet as though wrapping a package and press the edges to seal. Place the packages seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the egg wash over the tops and sides of each package and bake until the pastry is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 140 degrees F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Place the Beef Wellingtons in the center of 4 large plates, and accompany with the sauce and vegetables of choice. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.

Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the ice cream then place a pear on top. Drizzle more chocolate sauce on top of the pear, and top it with whipped cream and another drizzle of sauce. Pour the water, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice into a non-reactive 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Using a sharp knife, slice the vanilla beans in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the skins by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside. Add the seeds and skins to the mixture and continue heating. Peel and core the pears but do not halve them. Coring the pears from the bottom will encourage the poaching liquid to seep inside the pear and help it cook evenly inside and out. Add the pears to the lemon mixture and bring to a boil. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook for about 1 hour. Do not overcook the pears; they should be soft enough to pierce easily with a wooden skewer or toothpick. In order to keep the pears immersed in the liquid and help them to poach evenly, you must make a parchment paper lid to cover them. To make the lid, cut a round disk from a sheet of parchment paper that is slightly smaller than the diameter of your pan. Place the paper lid directly on top of the pears and poaching liquid. When the pears are fully poached, pour them and the poaching liquid into a clean container. You will need 1 whole pear for each serving. Heat the milk and chopped chocolate together in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan (this will keep the milk from burning) over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edge of the pan. While the milk is heating, combine the sugar and egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly incorporated and thick. Temper the egg mixture by pouring about half of the hot milk into it and whisk well. Now pour the tempered egg mixture into the remaining hot milk and chocolate. Cook over medium-high heat until slightly thickened, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. The mixture has finished cooking when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spatula, about 3 to 5 minutes. If you want to reduce the cooling time, you can cool the chocolate ice cream base over an ice bath. When the mixture is cool, spin it according to the type of ice cream machine you are using. The ice cream is ready when it is creamy and smooth, like the consistency of soft-serve ice cream. Place the ice cream in an airtight container and store in the freezer until ready to use. Pour the milk into a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. When it boils, remove the milk from the heat and make a ganache by adding the chopped chocolate. Whisk well, stirring into the edge of the saucepan to combine. The ganache should be homogenous and smooth. Set the ganache aside. In a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the heavy cream, butter, and sugar. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. The butter should be completely melted and the sugar completely dissolved. Once the mixture has come to a boil, pour the cream into the warm ganache. Place the sauce over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk. As the chocolate sauce cooks, it will begin to thicken slightly. When it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and pour it into a clean, dry bowl. Cover by placing plastic wrap directly on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Let the chocolate sauce cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator. When cold, the chocolate sauce will become thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling, Brachetto]&quot; 65673,&quot;Prosecco-Roasted Turkey with Lemon and Thyme 1 12- to 14-pound turkey, thawed if frozen Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 onion, quartered 1/2 bulb fennel, trimmed and cut into chunks 1 apple, cut into chunks 3 sprigs thyme, plus 1 tablespoon chopped leaves 1 lemon, zest grated, halved 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1 750-ml bottle dry prosecco or champagne 3 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (such as tarragon, chives and/or parsley), for the gravy Instructions: Position an oven rack in the lowest position (remove the other racks); preheat to 350 degrees F. Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey and set aside for the gravy. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels and rub inside and out with 2 tablespoons each salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the onion, fennel, apple, thyme sprigs and lemon halves. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Put the turkey on a rack set in a large roasting pan and tuck the wings under the body. Let sit at room temperature while you make the lemon-thyme butter. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat; whisk in the lemon zest and chopped thyme. Let cool slightly, then brush all over the turkey. Transfer to the oven and roast 1 hour. Meanwhile, start your gravy (use 1/2 cup of your prosecco in place of the white wine in your gravy). After the turkey has roasted 1 hour, pour the remaining prosecco all over the turkey (about 2 1/2 cups). Continue roasting, basting with the pan drippings every 30 minutes, until the skin is golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 more hours.

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook until fork-tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Pass the potatoes through a ricer into a large bowl or mash with a potato masher until smooth. Combine the milk, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until incorporated. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook over low heat, stirring, until the mixture comes together and pulls away from the side of the pan, about 1 minute. Continue stirring until the mixture is slightly shiny, about 4 more minutes. Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed, about 1 minute. Add half of the mashed potatoes and the whole egg and beat until incorporated. Add the remaining potatoes and the egg yolks and beat until creamy and smooth, about 1 more minute. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip. Set a large piece of parchment paper on a cutting board. Pipe about 24 mounds (1 to 1 1/2 inches each) of the potato mixture on the parchment. Cut the parchment between the mounds with a paring knife so each puff sits on its own piece of paper. Heat 2 inches of peanut oil in a large pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Working in batches, carefully invert each puff into the oil, leaving it on the parchment. The parchment will fall off as the puffs cook; remove with tongs. Fry until golden, turning as needed, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65676,&quot;Gravlax 2 cups kosher salt Sour cream or cream cheese, optional accompaniment 2 tablespoons cracked black peppercorns Sieved hard boiled eggs, optional accompaniment 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill 1/2 cup vanilla sugar, recipe follows 2 tablespoons orange zest strips (from 2 oranges) 1 (4 to 4 1/2-pound) side salmon fillet, skin on, pin bones removed, rinsed under cool water, and patted dry Salmon caviar, optional accompaniment Minced red onions, optional accompaniment Chopped parsley, optional accompaniment Toast points or lightly toasted bagels, optional accompaniment 1 vanilla beans, split in 1/2 lengthwise and crosswise 4 cups granulated sugar Instructions: Combine the salt, peppercorns, dill, sugar, and zest in a medium-size mixing bowl.

Place the salmon in the center of the pieces of plastic wrap, with the skin side down. Spoon the seasoning mixture over the top and sides of the salmon. Using your fingers, spread the mixture evenly over the salmon. No part of the flesh of the fish should be exposed. With the palm of your hand, gently press the mixture into the salmon. Fold the 2 pieces of plastic wrap very tightly around the salmon, folding in the ends securely. Wrap the salmon a second time with another large piece of plastic. Place the wrapped salmon in shallow glass baking dish. Top the salmon with another baking dish. Place 2 heavy cans or 2 clean, wrapped bricks on the baking sheet to weight the salmon. Refrigerate for 24 to 30 hours, depending upon the thickness of the fish. Remove from the refrigerator and unwrap the salmon carefully. Discard the wrap and scrape off the seasoning mixture. Rinse the salmon under cold water to remove the seasoning mixture. Pat dry. To serve, remove 2 inches from the tail of the salmon. Slice the salmon, at an angle, into paper-thin slices. Serve with accompaniments. In a large container with an airtight closure, place 1/2 of the sugar. Add the bean quarters and cover with the remaining 2 cups of sugar. Close tightly.

With the processor running, pour the vinegar and ice water through the feed tube and continue to process and pulse until the dough just comes together. Dump out on a floured board, form into a disk, wrap in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place the zucchini in a colander set over a plate. Toss it with 2 teaspoons of salt and set aside for 30 minutes. Spread the zucchini out on a clean dish towel, roll it up, and squeeze gently to remove some of the liquid. Put the zucchini slices into a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. With a fork, mash together the goat cheese, thyme, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll the dough out on a floured board to an 11-inch circle and place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Spread the dough with the goat cheese mixture, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Lay the zucchini slices in tightly overlapping circles, starting at the very edge of the pastry (the zucchini will shrink when it bakes). Continue overlapping circles of zucchini until the whole tart is covered. Drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with pepper. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until the dough is golden brown. Cut in wedges and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 65697,&quot;Caramel Apple Dip Two 11-ounce packages caramels, unwrapped 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 4 green apples Crushed chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreos Chocolate sauce Chopped salted peanuts Sea salt Crushed cereal, such as Fruity Pebbles Mini white chocolate chips Broken-up candy bars Mini candy-coated chocolates, such as M and M&#39;s<br> Brown sugar Ground cinnamon Instructions: Combine the caramels, cream, butter and vanilla in a small slow cooker.

Divide the sea salt evenly over the slices of salmon and reserve. Place 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small, heavy saucepan. Melt over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and cook for 1 minute. Cut out the white bulb of the fennel and cut it into tiny dice. You need 1 cup of diced fennel; if any of the bulb is left over, save it for another use. Reserve 4 teaspoons of the frilly green leaf at the other end of the fennel. Add the cup of diced fennel to the sauce pan and stir well to coat with the butter. Add the wine and the vinegar to the sauce pan. Reduce over high heat, until just a small amount of liquid remains ( a teaspoon or so). Moving the pan on and off the heat as required, start incorporating the remaining 10 tablespoons of butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating with a broad wooden spoon. The sauce should be smooth, creamy, and medium-thick. Taste for seasoning. While finishing the sauce, steam the salmon slices: Place them on a buttered steamer rack and cook them over barely simmering water until just done (approximately 3-6 minutes).

Cut 3 pieces of parchment paper to fit the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch metal baking pan. Spray the pan with cooking spray, line it with 1 piece of parchment, and spray the parchment. Reserve the other 2 parchment pieces. Prepare the cake mix batter according to the package directions. Transfer the batter to a large liquid measuring cup and then divide it equally among 3 bowls. Use red food coloring to tint each bowl a different shade of pink: about 4 drops for lightest color, 8 for medium, and 16 for the darkest. Pour the darkest batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth it with an offset spatula. Shake the pan vigorously and tap it against the counter a few times to even out the batter and release any air bubbles. Bake until set and the edges are starting to pull away from the pan, about 9 minutes. Cool in the pan for 2 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack and let cool completely. Invert the cake onto a large cutting board and spread it with 1/3 cup of the jam. Meanwhile, cool the baking pan under running water, dry well, and prepare as before with cooking spray, another piece of parchment, and more spray. Repeat the baking and cooling steps with the medium-colored batter. When completely cool, flip the cake directly onto the first cake -- it&#39;s okay if the edges don&#39;t line up perfectly -- and spread with the remaining 1/3 cup jam. Cool the pan once again and repeat with the lightest batter. When cool, flip directly on top of the layered cake. Put the white chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Heat the cream to just shy of a boil in the microwave. Pour over the chips and let stand for 30 seconds before stirring until smooth. Refrigerate until cold, about 20 minutes.

Pulse together the flour, baking powder, sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons each salt and pepper in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until pea-sized pieces form. Add the cheese and chives and pulse until just combined. Add the buttermilk and pulse a couple of times until the dough just comes together but is not fully incorporated.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat together gently into a ball. Use your hands to divide the dough into 6 even pieces. Generously coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Using the baking sheet as your work surface, pat each piece of dough into a 3 1/2-inch round about 3/4 inch thick. Arrange 3 dough rounds along the top long edge of the baking sheet, spacing them out evenly and making sure there is a 1/2-inch space between the dough rounds and the edges of the baking sheet. Arrange the remaining 3 dough rounds in the same fashion along the bottom long edge of the baking sheet. Cut the center out of each round with a 2-inch round cookie cutter. Arrange these smaller rounds evenly across the middle of the baking sheet.<br> Brush the tops of all the dough pieces with buttermilk and bake until the smaller biscuits are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove them and transfer to a plate.<br> Lay a piece of ham over each of the large rounds. Push each ham piece down into the hole so that it forms a cup. Crack 1 egg into each of the ham cups. If a little of the egg white spills over, it&#39;s okay. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper. Bake, rotating the pan front to back after 5 minutes, until the whites are just set and the yolks are still jiggly when you lightly shake the baking sheet, 8 to 12 minutes more.<br> Use a spatula to remove them to individual plates and top each with a smaller biscuit piece for dipping into the egg.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 65739,&quot;Yogurty Marinated Chicken Skewers 1 1/4 pounds (566 grams) boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch chunks 1 medium red onion (240 grams), cut into 1-inch chunks and separated 1 medium zucchini (300 grams), cut into 1/2-inch rounds or half-moons, depending on width 1 small red bell pepper (150 grams), cut into 1-inch squares 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 cups (450 grams) whole-milk plain Greek yogurt 1/4 cup (53 grams) freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 cup (7 grams) chopped fresh Italian parsley 1/4 cup (7 grams) chopped fresh mint 1 tablespoon (21 grams) honey 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1/4 cup (52 grams) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing Instructions: If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes.

Brush 1 baking sheet with almond oil; set aside. Place the almonds on another baking sheet and toast them until light golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup water and cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until a medium amber color. Remove the caramel from the heat, immediately add the almonds and stir quickly to thoroughly combine. Turn out onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading quickly to an even thickness. Allow the brittle to cool completely. Coarsely chop and reserve. Heat the milk, cream and 1/2 cup sugar in a medium saucepan until the sugar dissolves and the milk starts to simmer. Add the cocoa powder and chocolate and whisk until smooth. Place the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on high speed until pale yellow and ribbons form, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the stand and slowly whisk in the hot chocolate mixture. Pour the egg and chocolate mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thickened and the mixture coats the back of the spoon. Do not allow the mixture to boil! Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strain into a bowl set over an ice bath and stir in the coffee liqueur, vanilla and salt. Stir until the mixture is cold. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the custard and chill completely in the refrigerator, at least 4 and up to 24 hours. Pour the chilled custard into the bowl of an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Stir in the coarsely chopped almond brittle. Spray a 2 quart glass bowl with cooking spray, line with plastic wrap and spray the plastic wrap. Scrape the ice cream into the bowl and smooth the top. The ice cream will not fill the bowl; you&#39;re looking for the larger surface of the ice cream to be about 8 inches in diameter. Press more plastic wrap over the top and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter 1 (9-inch cake) pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the cocoa powder and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the sugars and whisk until dissolved. Add the coffee, buttermilk, eggs and vanilla extract and continue whisking until smooth. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake on the middle rack until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pans on a baking rack for 20 minutes. For the meringue: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Fill a medium saucepan 1/4 full with water. Set the saucepan over medium heat and bring the water to a simmer. Combine the egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer and place over the saucepan. Whisk constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the whites are warm to the touch, about 3 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to high speed, whip until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 10 minutes. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and the chocolate and mix until combined. Immediately fill a pastry bag, fitted with a #5 star tip, with the meringue. To assemble: Unmold the ice cream onto the cake and pipe the meringue onto the ice cream in a decorative fashion (or spoon the meringue over the ice cream and swirl with a rubber spatula). If the ice cream starts to soften, return the cake to the freezer for 15 minutes. Place in the oven and bake until the meringue just starts to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo]&quot; 65747,&quot;Chocolate Filled Crepes Covered with Strawberry Sauce 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 egg, beaten 1 cup milk, plus a dash 1/2 tablespoon butter 1 (4-ounce) package cream cheese 1/2 cup powdered cocoa 10 strawberries, sliced thinly 1 jigger Grand Marnier 1 tablespoon sugar Instructions: In a mixing bowl, mix the flour, egg and milk together until smooth.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add both cans of tomatoes and 1 cup of water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat slightly, add the basil sprigs and simmer rapidly, uncovered, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the basil sprigs and stir in the chopped basil and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl with a slotted spoon. Cook the farfalle in the salted boiling water until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than the package directions. Drain the pasta and add it to the bowl. Add the tomato sauce, red peppers, half of the provolone and half of the pecorino to the bowl and stir well to combine. Transfer the pasta to a 3- to 4-quart baking dish and top with the remaining provolone and pecorino. Bake, uncovered, until browned, about 15 minutes.

When the items are incorporated properly you can begin to form bite-size balls with the mixture. If the sweet potato mixture is not forming properly, add more flour and mix again. After forming the balls, put them on a plate, side by side, until all the mixture is used. When the plate is filled, wrap in plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for at least 1 hour. While the balls are freezing, prepare a \\dredging\\ station. This should consist of (in this order) 1 bowl of seasoned flour (seasoning with salt and pepper is fine, you can also add more bacon salt seasoning) 1 bowl with 2 beaten eggs, and 1 bowl with seasoned panko bread crumbs (same seasoning as flour). When the bites are frozen begin the drudging process. You do this by rolling the balls in the flour, then dipping in the egg, then rolling them in the bread crumbs. Repeat this process with all the sweet potato bites. Fill a frying pan half way full with canola oil. Heat the oil to about 350 to 375 degrees F. When the proper temperature is achieved, gently drop the bites into the oil and cook until the entire outer layer of the bite is a golden brown. Transfer the bites to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. When all the balls have been fried and are cooling, take a small mixing bowl and mix the sour cream and the bacon ranch dip mix until it is totally incorporated. Take the tip of the kitchen syringe and put in the dip; pull the lever to transfer the dip into the shaft of the syringe. Insert the needlepoint of the syringe into the center of a sweet potato bite, then gently inject the dip into the bite. You may need to experiment with 1 or 2 bites before you get the technique down. You want to slightly fill the bite, but not overstuff it to the point where the dip leaks out. Continue this process until all the bites have been filled. Arrange the bits on a serving platter and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65766,&quot;Pan Roasted Green Onion Romesco (Spanish) 4 bunches large green onions Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 red bell peppers 4 Roma tomatoes 2 thick slices country white bread 1/2 cup toasted marcona almonds 3 garlic cloves, smashed 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Put a large skillet over high heat. Put the green onions into a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Toss well to coat. When the pan is smoking, add some olive oil to it and immediately add the green onions in 1 layer. Keep the onions moving until they are browned on all sides but are still crisp in the middle. Put them onto several sheets of newspaper and wrap them up to steam. Arrange the peppers and tomatoes on a baking pan and broil, turning often, until they are black and charred on all sides. Put the peppers in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Put the tomatoes on a board to cool a bit. Toast the bread under the broiler. When the peppers are steamed and cool enough to handle, peel off the skin, remove the stem and seeds, and put them into the bowl of a food processor. Peel and seed the tomatoes and add them to the food processor. Cut the toasted bread into cubes and add it in too. Add the almonds, garlic, paprika, and vinegar and start pulsing. Drizzle in the olive oil while pulsing. Taste and check the seasoning for salt and pepper. Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl. Unwrap the green onions and peel off the charred outer layer.

Let sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine the salt, cardamom and 3 1/2 cups flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix briefly on low speed to combine. Beat together the 1 egg, 3 yolks, honey and oil in a medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, mixing on low speed until combined. Add 1 more cup flour and mix on medium speed to make a sticky dough that comes together in a loose mass around the paddle. Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium speed to make a smooth but still somewhat sticky dough that clears the sides of the bowl, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if necessary, about 4 minutes. Dump the dough onto a floured work surface and knead by hand a few times to make a smooth ball. Oil a large bowl and turn the dough ball in the oil to coat it. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the filling and glaze: Meanwhile, stir together the jam and cardamom in a small bowl.<br> Shape the dough: When the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 4 equal pieces. Line an unrimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Form the dough pieces into balls on a floured work surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll one ball into a 10-inch circle and place on the prepared baking sheet. Spread with a third of the filling, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Roll out another dough disc in the same manner and place on top of the first; top with the second third of filling. Repeat with a third dough disc and the remaining filling. Roll out the remaining dough disc and place it on top of the last layer of filling.<br> Center the bottom of a small drinking glass (about 2 inches in diameter) in the middle of the dough to mark the center. At the 12 o&#39;clock mark, cut through the dough with a very sharp knife from the edge of the glass to the edge of the dough circle, leaving the dough underneath the glass uncut. Repeat at the 3 o&#39;clock, 6 o&#39;clock and 9 o&#39;clock points on the circle to make 4 quarters. Cut through the middle of each quarter in the same manner to make 8 equal wedges. Cut through each wedge one more time in the same manner to make 16 wedges.<br> Remove the drinking glass. Lift the edges of 2 wedges that are next to each other and twist them away from each other twice, then pinch the ends together to reconnect them and make a pointed tip. Repeat with the remaining pairs of wedges. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.<br> Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons milk in a small bowl. Brush the egg wash all over the risen dough. Pinch the points again to reshape if the dough has risen so much that the points no longer look pointy. Bake the bread until puffed and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on a rack until just warm, about 30 minutes.<br> Stir together the confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons milk in a small bowl, adding up to 1 tablespoon more milk or confectioners&#39; sugar if needed so that the glaze is the correct consistency to slowly drizzle off the end of the spoon.

Try to buy the best ingredients you can, as that&#39;s what really helps to make this dish amazing. I&#39;m using a flowering variegated variety of thyme but normal thyme is fine to use. When it comes to the type of pasta, you can serve carbonara with spaghetti or linguine, but I&#39;ve been told by Italian mammas (who I don&#39;t argue with!) that penne is the original, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m using in this recipe. Before you start cooking, it&#39;s important to get yourself a very large pan, or use a high-sided roasting pan so you can give the pasta a good toss. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Halve and then quarter any larger zucchini lengthwise. Cut out and discard any fluffy middle bits, and slice the zucchini at an angle into pieces roughly the same size and shape as the penne. Smaller zucchini can simply be sliced finely. Your water will now be boiling, so add the penne to the pan and cook according to the package instructions. To make your creamy carbonara sauce, put the egg yolks into a bowl, add the cream and half the Parmesan, and mix together with a fork. Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside. Heat a very large frying pan (a 14-inch is a good start - every house should have one!), add a good splash of olive oil and fry the pancetta or bacon until dark brown and crisp. Add the zucchini slices and 2 big pinches of black pepper, not just to season but to give it a bit of a kick. Sprinkle in the thyme leaves, give everything a stir, so the zucchini is coated with all the lovely bacon-flavored oil, and fry until they start to turn lightly golden and have softened slightly. It&#39;s very important to get this next bit right or your carbonara could end up ruined. You need to work quickly. When the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a little of the cooking water. Immediately, toss the pasta in the pan with the zucchini, bacon and lovely flavors, then remove from the heat and add a ladleful of the reserved cooking water and your creamy sauce. Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you&#39;ll scramble the eggs.) Get everyone around the table, ready to eat straightaway. While you&#39;re tossing the pasta and sauce, sprinkle in the rest of the Parmesan and a little more of the cooking water if needed, to give you a silky and shiny sauce. Taste quickly for seasoning. If you&#39;ve managed to get any zucchini flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Use a paring knife to cut out tree shape and discard. Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Lay the foam board on top of the parchment paper. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate inside the foam template, careful to coat to the edges. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut, but it will not be hard. Lift the template away from the chocolate tree. Move this finished piece to a clean space on your work surface out of the way. Repeat the process 7 more times so you&#39;ll have 8 tree outlines. For the support: Roll a piece of parchment paper to make a tube about 1/2-inch in diameter. Tape the paper closed. Fill the tube with tempered white chocolate to six inches. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut, but it will not be hard. Cut 3 pieces of the chocolate tube, each about 2-inches long. These will be used to support the tree when it is glued together. To make the base: Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate on the paper. This will be the base for your tree. Let the chocolate harden. You can also paint a piece of cardboard with chocolate to create the base. That will be sturdier and allow you to move it more easily. Use the tempered chocolate to \\glue\\ the first tree piece to the base. Join the second tree piece using the small tubes of chocolate for additional support where the tree pieces meet. Continue \\gluing\\ the pieces together until all 8 are assembled. Let stand until the chocolate is dry. You can decorate your tree with homemade or store-bought cookies or candy. Use the tempered chocolate to glue the decorations onto the tree. You can string popcorn or cranberries. You can glue mini candy-coated chocolate baking bits onto the tree to represent lights. Use your imagination and have fun! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65782,&quot;Cornbread Dressing 8 tablespoons butter, divided 1 large Vidalia or Spanish onion, chopped (about 1 cup) Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3/4 cup water 6 cups cubed (1-inch pieces) store-bought or homemade cornbread, about 1 pound 1/3 cup fresh sage leaves, about 12, stems removed 2 large eggs, beaten Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

You will pay attention, follow along and execute these directions! C&#39;est serieux! Now let&#39;s do this! In a heavy nonreactive saucepan, add water, sugar, corn syrup and cream of tartar. The last two help keep the sugar from crystallizing. (Candy thermometer is nonnegotiable!)<br> Put the pan on high heat. It&#39;s going to be there for a while. Be patient and keep your eye on it. Don&#39;t go walking away and watch TV or something.<br> Put yolks and egg in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and turn to high. Just let it go! Eggs will triple in volume and go to the \\ribbon stage.\\ You can&#39;t overwhip!<br> Wait on the sugar - you&#39;re looking for 235 degrees F, aka \\soft-ball stage.\\ When it happens, be ready to move quickly. Turn off the mixer and add xanthan gum, then turn back on to medium speed. Remove the thermometer from hot sugar. Lift pan with two hands.<br> Rest the lip of the saucepan on the edge of the mixer bowl. Slowly tilt and pour sugar in a sloooow steady stream down the side of the bowl. Don&#39;t go too fast! If you do there will be chunks of scrambled eggs in your buttercream.<br> Once sugar is all in, turn the mixer to high. Beat til cool. Gauge this by putting the inside of your wrist on the outside of the bowl. It&#39;s more accurate than your hands.<br> Switch out the whisk for the paddle. Next we&#39;re adding the butter. It&#39;s too heavy for the whisk and you&#39;ll end up breaking your stand mixer if you stay with the whisk.<br> Start cutting the butter into thin pieces - you could shave it with a cheese slicer if you&#39;d like. Add butter piece by piece - pain in the derriere, yes, but we&#39;re making an emulsion.<br> See, if you dump all the butter in at once, the butter and eggs will never combine properly and you&#39;ll have a \\broken\\ buttercream. You&#39;ll be able to identify this easily - it&#39;ll be a chunky, watery, hot mess.<br> If your buttercream does break, you can fix it! Turn to medium-high, then add a little more butter, piece by piece, til fixed. Or try adding a little guar gum! This is very strong, so only add a pinch and beat for a minute, then check.<br> Once your butter is added, turn the mixer to medium-high to add some air - 10 or 20 seconds at most. Quelle magnifique! It should be fluffy and make you want to eat it with your fingers.<br> Once you have your base, there are so many ways to flavor it! Coffee powder! Vanilla beans! Dutch cocoa! Peanut butter! Caramel! Ham! (OK; maybe not ham. Party pooper.)<br> Congratulations! You did it! You made French buttercream! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 65800,&quot;Burnt End Philly 1 cup paprika 3/4 cup light brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup ground cumin<br> 1/4 cup garlic salt<br> 1/4 cup onion salt<br> 1/8 cup cayenne pepper<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon beef base<br> 8 pounds brisket, trimmed of all but 1/4-inch fat Your favorite rub, for the brisket<br> 8 ounces barbecue sauce<br> 1 cup brown ale beer<br> 1 sliced green pepper<br> 1 sliced white onion<br> 1 cup sliced white mushrooms<br> 4 to 6 hoagie rolls, preferably Amoroso brand<br> 4 ounces cheese dip, such as Cheese Whiz<br> Instructions: Bring the paprika, light brown sugar, cumin, garlic salt, onion salt, cayenne pepper, soy sauce, beef base and 4 cups water to a low boil in a pan. Boil everything until dissolved, then let cool. Transfer to a flavor injector, then inject into the brisket in a pattern, every inch across the grain, and then the remainder with the grain. Pat the brisket dry and coat with rub. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 5 hours. Prepare a smoker for smoking at 275 degrees F. Smoke the brisket until its internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, 4 to 5 hours. Wrap in foil and put back in the smoker until the internal temp reaches 205 degrees F, 3 to 4 hours more. Remove from heat to rest. Separate the point form the flat, then cut the point into cubes and put back in the smoker in a foil pan. (Save the flat for another use.) Cook until the points reach 205 degrees F, then then toss with barbecue sauce, beer and a shake of rub. Saute green peppers, green onions and mushrooms until soft.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the tomato halves flesh-side up in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. In a medium bowl, whisk together 4 tablespoons of the olive oil, the confectioners&#39; sugar, red pepper flakes and 2 teaspoons salt. Spread the mixture evenly over the tomato halves. Roast the tomatoes until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Heat a large skillet over high heat and add half of the canola oil. When it begins to smoke lightly, add half of the poblanos and cook to tenderize without making them mushy. Using a slotted spoon, remove the peppers to a baking sheet, cavity-side up. Repeat with the remaining poblanos and canola oil. Season with salt and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the thyme. As the oil heats, the thyme will fry and become crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the thyme sprigs, then season with salt and cool. Add the bell peppers to the same skillet and season with salt. Cook over high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the peppers brown slightly but are still slightly firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the peppers and transfer to a medium bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, heat until it begins to smoke lightly, and add the garlic and onions. Reduce the heat to medium. Season with salt and cook until the onions are lightly brown and tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the onions to the bell peppers. Quarter the oven-dried tomatoes and add to the pepper and onion mix. Chop the basil leaves and stir into the filling along with the red wine vinegar and mozzarella. Pull the thyme leaves off the stems and add to the mixture. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. In a medium bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan and melted butter. Stuff each pepper halfway with the filling, and then top with the breadcrumb mixture. Heat the peppers in the oven to brown the tops, 10 to 12 minutes. Arrange on a platter and drizzle with the balsamic vinegar to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 65804,&quot;Game-Day Steak Sandwiches with Whipped Goat Cheese and Calabrian cl Salsa Verde 1 ribeye cap steak (3 to 5 pounds) or 2 to 3 flank steaks, trimmed Steak Marinade, optional, recipe follows Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 red bell peppers 2 yellow bell peppers Olive oil for drizzling 2 zucchini, ends trimmed 4 ciabatta rolls or 1 loaf ciabatta, split 1 pound goat cheese 1/2 cup heavy cream 6 Calabrian chiles or other hot pickled cl peppers, minced 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 red onion, minced Leaves from 1 bunch parsley, finely chopped Leaves from 1/2 bunch oregano, finely chopped Leaves from 1/2 bunch cilantro, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup olive oil 6 garlic cloves, minced Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped 1 red finger cl (fresh cayenne pepper), minced Instructions: If marinating the steak, place it in a casserole dish. Pour the Steak Marinade over the steak and turn to coat completely. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. When ready to cook, remove the steak from the marinade, if using, and allow the steak to come to room temperature. Discard the marinade. Preheat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high. Season the steak with salt and black pepper. Grill the steak to the desired doneness, 10 to 15 minutes for medium rare (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak should register 130 degrees F). Place the steak on a cutting board and allow to rest at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place the bell peppers on the grill. Turn the peppers frequently, charring the skin evenly on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a large bowl. While the peppers are still piping hot, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the peppers to steam for 15 minutes. Place the peppers on a cutting board. Remove the stems and seeds. Using a kitchen towel, wipe off the charred skin. Slice the peppers into strips. Place the pepper strips in a medium bowl and drizzle with oil. Set aside. Slice the zucchini lengthwise into 3/4-inch-thick planks. Place in a large bowl, drizzle with oil, season with salt and black pepper and toss to coat. Grill the zucchini until tender, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Set aside. Drizzle a little oil on the cut sides of the ciabatta and toast on the grill. In a medium bowl, combine the goat cheese and cream and whisk together until smooth. Set aside. For the cl salsa verde: Combine the chiles, garlic, onions, parsley, oregano, cilantro and oil in a large bowl and mix well. Season with salt. Set aside. To assemble the sandwiches, thinly slice the steak against the grain. Place a dollop of the whipped goat cheese on both halves of the toasted ciabatta and spread evenly. Layer the sliced steak over the cheese and put a generous amount of the cl salsa verde on top of the steak. Layer the grilled zucchini and roasted peppers into the sandwiches. Close the sandwiches with the top half of ciabatta, slice and serve.<br> Combine the Worcestershire, oil, garlic, rosemary and cl in a large bowl and mix well. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 65805,&quot;Seafood and Chorizo Paella 6 cups chicken stock 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 3 links cured chorizo, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick half moons<br> 1 cup minced Spanish onion 1 small green bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips 1 small red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips<br> 1 clove garlic, smashed<br> 1 cup diced tomatoes<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 3 cups bomba rice<br> 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads<br> Six head-on shrimp (21-25 count), deveined, or 12 littleneck clams, purged and scrubbed 1 cup shelled peas, blanched<br> Lemon wedges, for garnish<br> Minced fresh parsley, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Simmer the chicken stock in a medium saucepan. In a 13-inch paella pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until lightly browned; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the onions, peppers and garlic to the pan and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stir to combine, then stir in the rice and saffron. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 minutes. Pour in 5 cups of the simmering chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and season with salt. Arrange the chorizo and shrimp on top of the rice. Set the pan on the floor of the oven or on the lowest oven rack and bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes. (Do not stir the paella once it goes in the oven.) Scatter the peas over the paella, return to the oven and continue cooking until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender but not too soft, another 5 to 10 minutes. If the rice needs further cooking, add the remaining cup of stock and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Let the paella stand at room temperature, covered with foil, for 5 minutes. Serve garnished with lemon wedges and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 65806,&quot;Miniature Yule Log Yodels 18 mini marshmallows One 11.16-ounce box snack-size chocolate-coated Swiss roll cakes, such as Yodels (10 cakes), refrigerated 1 1/2 cups chocolate frosting 12 sprigs fresh rosemary Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving Instructions: Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Put the mini marshmallows in the skillet with a flat side down. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Let cool in the skillet. Slice a thin piece off both ends of 6 of the Swiss roll cakes to reveal the swirls (discard the end pieces). These will be the logs. Next, slice off the end of one of the remaining cakes on a 30-degree angle, then slice the cake into thirds, making parallel cuts to the end angle and finishing by cutting the second end on the same angle. If the chocolate coating falls off, that&#39;s okay; discard it. Discard the ends. Repeat with another cake. These angled pieces will be the branches. (Note that you will have 2 unused cakes, in case you mess up; if you don&#39;t mess up, you can just eat them.)<br> Cut out six 3-inch parchment squares. Flip a water glass upside down and place one of the parchment squares on the flat bottom. Place a cake log on the parchment. With a butter knife or small offset spatula, spread a thin layer of frosting over the chocolate coating. Run the tip of the knife or spatula down the length of the log to create wide ridges. Stick the end of one branch onto the side of the log and spread frosting over the chocolate coating (or where the chocolate coating would be). Stick 3 of the marshmallows, browned-side up, onto the side of the yule log. Carefully slide the parchment with the yule log off of the glass; set aside. Repeat with the remaining logs, branches, frosting and marshmallows to create 5 additional yule logs.<br> Freeze the yule logs on their parchment squares until the frosting is set, at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days (in an airtight container). To serve, transfer each log to a plate, remove the parchment and arrange 2 sprigs of rosemary under each one.

Chop the meat into large chunks. Cut the chicken carcass into 2 or 3 pieces and put in a large pot with the chicken broth, leek greens, chunked celery, carrot peels, garlic, cilantro stems and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add 6 cups water to cover, bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the carcass is falling apart and the broth is flavorful, 20 to 25 minutes. Strain the broth, discarding any solids, and reserve. Wipe the pot clean and heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped leeks, celery, carrots, zucchini and yellow squash. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until the leeks begin to wilt, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the harissa, ras el hanout and tomato paste and stir to coat the vegetables, cooking until the spices darken. Add the broth and chickpeas, cover and simmer until the vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the chopped chicken, cilantro leaves and the spinach. Cook until the spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes.

Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat; add the shallot and garlic and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool. Meanwhile, mix together the egg, panko, Worcestershire and oregano in a medium bowl, and stir until combined. Add the breadcrumb mixture to the beef, along with the cooled shallots and garlic, and mix until the ingredients are well combined. Using a 1/2-cup measure, divide the mixture into 6 equal portions and form them into long ovals, about 1/2-inch thick. (If using the mixture to make Mini Meatball-Stuffed Pitas, recipe below, reserve 1 cup of the seasoned meat and make only 4 burgers.) Preheat the broiler and position a rack 8 to 10 inches below it. Heat a heavy grill pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook the burgers, turning once, until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Meanwhile, spread a thin layer of Chipotle Aioli on the cut sides of the rolls and put them on a baking sheet, cut-sides up. Broil until the aioli browns slightly and the rolls are toasted on the edges. To assemble the burgers, place a burger on each roll and top with lettuce, avocado, jalapeno and more aioli, if desired. Serve immediately. Put the garlic and chipotle in a food processor and puree until very smooth. Add the mayonnaise and lime juice and blend until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Roll the meat mixture into16 mini meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter and place them on the baking sheet. Bake until completely cooked through, about 12 minutes. Cool briefly. To assemble, cut the top third off of each pita. Divide the meatballs among the pitas, top with lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes and drizzle with the sour cream. Yield: 4 pitas &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 65809,&quot;Peanut Butter Cup Bites 3 cups rolled oats 1 1/2 cups crunchy peanut butter<br> 1 cup honey<br> 2/3 cup ground flaxseed<br> 2 tablespoons coconut oil<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 cups chopped semisweet chocolate 1/4 cup coconut oil<br> Instructions: Prepare a baking sheet with parchment and a baking rack. For the bites: Add the oats, peanut butter, honey, flaxseed, coconut oil and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. This can also be done in a bowl with a spoon and a bit of elbow grease. Mix until completely combined. Using a tablespoon-sized scoop, scoop the dough and roll it in your hands until it forms a ball. Repeat with the remainder of the mixture. As you work, place the balls on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. For the chocolate shell: Add the chocolate and coconut oil to a bowl set over a pot of simmering water and allow it to melt and become smooth, about 3 minutes. Mix until smooth and set aside. Remove the bites from the freezer. One at a time, drop one bite in the chocolate shell, remove it with a fork (or two) and return it to the same baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining bites. Return the baking sheet to the freezer to set the chocolate shell, about 10 minutes. Sneak one now and transfer the remaining bites to a resealable plastic bag. Store in the freezer. When you are ready to enjoy them, allow them to thaw for 10 minutes or more at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 65810,&quot;Potato Bagels 12 ounces russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast<br> 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon brown sugar 6 cups high-gluten flour, plus more if needed and for dusting<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 7 1/2 teaspoons barley malt syrup Neutral oil, for the bowl Nonstick cooking spray, for the parchment 1 tablespoon baking soda Instructions: Place the chopped potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a simmer and cook until a fork pokes easily into the potatoes; begin checking for doneness at about 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water in a medium bowl. Rice the potatoes and set aside. Add 1/2 cup cool water to the bowl with the hot cooking water; the temperature of the water should even out to warm (105 to 110 degrees F). If it&#39;s too cold, microwave it a little; if it&#39;s too hot, let it sit for a few minutes to cool. Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the brown sugar, give it a little swirl and let it sit until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, salt and remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Add the mashed potato, yeast mixture and 4 1/2 teaspoons of the barley malt and mix to form a stiff dough. Knead in the stand mixer until smooth and slightly sticky, adding additional flour if the dough is sticking to the bowl or too sticky to handle, about 5 minutes (or turn out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for 7 to 10 minutes). Transfer to a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. When ready to bake, let the dough sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide into 12 or 16 equal parts, depending on whether you want larger or smaller bagels. Stretch each part into a smooth ball, making sure to seal any dough seams well. Shape the bagels by sticking your thumb through the center of each ball and using your fingers to gently stretch a 2-inch hole. Cover the bagels with a towel and let rise for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F; line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and grease them well with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add the baking soda and remaining 3 teaspoons barley malt. Working with 3 or 4 bagels at a time so as not to crowd the pot, boil them for 1 minute on each side (use a timer for this). With a slotted spoon or spatula, lift them out of the water, allowing excess water to drip off, and then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. (If making 16 bagels, you will likely need to bake a third pan of bagels, which you can do after the first 2 pans come out of the oven.) With a serrated knife, make 3 cuts in a triangular shape on top of the bagels and dust them lightly with flour. Bake the bagels for 10 minutes, then switch racks, rotate the baking sheets 180 degrees and bake until golden brown, 5 to 8 more minutes. Let cool slightly. If not eating right away, cool the bagels fully, then transfer to plastic bags and freeze (slice them before freezing if you&#39;d like, so you can put them directly from the freezer into the toaster). Reheat in the toaster. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65811,&quot;Shoofly Pie 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 large egg 1 cup molasses 1 teaspoon baking soda Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add about one-third of the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like cornmeal. Add the remaining butter and pulse 3 times, or until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Drizzle in 3 tablespoons ice water and the vinegar and pulse 3 or 4 times, just until combined (do not let the dough come together into a ball). Pinch the dough between your fingers; if it doesn&#39;t hold together, add up to 2 more tablespoons ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, pulsing. Turn out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and pat the dough into a disk; wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Roll out the dough into an 11-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges with your fingers. Refrigerate the crust 1 hour. Place a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Make the filling: Whisk the flour, brown sugar and butter in a large heatproof bowl; set aside 2/3 cup of the mixture for topping. Whisk the egg, molasses and baking soda into the remaining brown sugar mixture, then whisk in 3/4 cup boiling water until smooth. Pour the filling into the chilled crust.

Soak for about 20 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to a blender. Add the cumin seeds, oregano, thyme, salt, garlic, and vinegar. Blend to a fairly smooth paste, but do not over blend. Pound the pork chops with a wooden mallet until flat. Spread a layer of the chili paste on both sides of the chops, place them in a large shallow baking dish and refrigerate overnight or for 24 hours, covered. In a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the pork fat until it renders, or heat a teaspoon of the lard over medium-low heat. Cook the chops very slowly, for about 20 minutes, turning over once. Add more fat during the cooking time if the pan gets very dry and the cl paste is in danger of scorching. When the chops are done through (press them to see if the flesh springs back), raise the heat to medium-high and quickly brown them on both sides. Serve the chops immediately, garnished with Apple-Tamarind Sauce, sour cream, and pancakes. Break up the tamarind, pulling it apart into marble-sized pieces. In a bowl, cover with I cup boiling water and leave to soak for at least 2 hours or overnight. Strain the liquid through a medium-mesh sieve into a large saucepan, pressing down hard on the solids. Discard the solids. Stir in the honey, ginger, and salt. Add the apples and place the pan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened into applesauce. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 65815,&quot;Kale and Cashew Pesto 1/3 cup lightly toasted cashews 3 cups loosely packed kale 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest Pinch of red pepper flakes Kosher salt 1/2 cup coarsely grated aged pecorino 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Put the cashews in a food processor and pulse until finely ground.

Add both sugars and beat for another 2 minutes or so, until well blended. Beat in the vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 1 minute after each egg goes in. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients in 4 or 5 additions, mixing only until each addition is just incorporated. (Because you&#39;re going to add more ingredients after the flour, it&#39;s good not to be too thorough.) Still on low speed, mix in the chocolate and nut flour.<br> Divide the dough in half, wrap each piece airtight in plastic film and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Or, if it&#39;s more convenient for you, you can scoop the dough now and freeze it in balls. You won&#39;t need to defrost the cookies, but you will need to bake them a little longer.)<br> When you&#39;re ready to bake: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.<br> Edouard says to scoop the dough into mounds the size of golf balls. A medium cookie scoop with a capacity of 1 1/2 tablespoons is just right here, but you can also spoon the dough out using a rounded tablespoon of dough for each cookie. Place the dough on the lined sheets, about 2 inches apart.<br> Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 8 minutes and then, using a metal spatula, gently press each mound down just a little; rotate the baking sheet. Bake for another 7 minutes or so, until the cookies are pale brown. They&#39;ll still be slightly soft in the center, but that&#39;s fine-they&#39;ll firm as they cool. Pull the sheet from the oven and allow the cookies to rest for 1 minute, then, using a wide metal spatula, carefully transfer them to racks to cool to room temperature. Repeat with the remainder of the dough, always using a cool baking sheet.<br> Serving: The cookies are good warm or at room temperature; good with coffee, good with tea and terrific with milk (a beverage I&#39;ve never seen a grown French person sip); and even good with Armagnac. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 65818,&quot;Herbed Brown Rice Pilaf 1 tablespoon butter 1 shallot, chopped 1 cup long-grain brown rice Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 1/2 cups chicken broth or water, warmed 1 clove garlic, smashed 2 sprigs fresh thyme 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 3 green onions, thinly sliced Instructions: Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat.

In another medium bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, molasses, brown sugar, orange zest and egg. Slowly add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just combined. It is ok if the batter is a little lumpy. Do not overmix or you will have tough pancakes. (Let the batter sit for at least 5 minutes and up to 30 minutes for fluffier pancakes.) For the icing: In a small bowl, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk. Set aside. Grease a griddle or nonstick skillet with butter and heat to medium high. Pour 1/4 to 1/3 cup batter per pancake onto the griddle. When small bubbles begin to form on the tops of the pancakes, after 2 to 3 minutes, flip the pancakes and cook on the other side for 2 to 3 minutes.

Grease and flour 2 (8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch) loaf pans. Put the candies in a large bowl and mix them up well. Take 2 tablespoons of the flour and toss it with the candies to coat them so they will not sink or stick together. Set aside. Whisk the baking powder and salt into the remaining flour and set aside. Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a hand held mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar a little at a time scraping down the sides of the bowl once or twice, until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time beating well, then the vanilla. Pour in half the flour mixture and beat on low speed until it is incorporated. Do the same with the remaining flour. The batter will be stiff and you might have to finish this by hand. Fold in the candies. Divide the mixture evenly between the 2 prepared pans pressing it in well so there are no air pockets; smooth the top. Bake until puffed and browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 to 70 minutes.

Cut the bottom section- usually about 1 to 2 inches off the asparagus stalks with a sharp knife. Peel the asparagus by laying them flat, one at a time, on a cutting board. If the asparagus are thinner than 1/2-inch, use a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus starting at the base of the tip and peeling them all the way down to the base, eliminating the fibrous peel and revealing the pale green flesh. If the asparagus are very thick or woody, use a paring knife and start peeling from the base. When ready to cook, toss the salt into the boiling water and carefully lower in the asparagus. Turn the heat to low and simmer the asparagus, uncovered, until the spears are easily penetrated with a knife, usually after about 5 minutes but from 1 minute for very thin asparagus to 12 minutes for the very thickest. If serving cold asparagus, plunge the hot cooked asparagus into ice water or rinse under cold water in a colander.

Spray a pie plate with cooking spray. Make the batter; pour into the pie plate until three-quarters full. Bake until set around the edges but slightly wobbly in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, make the strawberry filling: Toss the strawberries, granulated sugar and salt in a bowl. Let sit 20 minutes. Unroll 1 piece of pie dough on a lightly floured cutting board. Cut into 1- to 1 1/4-inch-wide strips with a knife. Set aside. Unroll the remaining piece of pie dough. Cut three 1-inch-wide strips from the middle of the round and press the strips together, end to end, to form one long strip. (This will be used for the piecrust rim.) Transfer the partially baked cake to a rack; cool slightly. Drain the strawberry mixture and spoon it onto the cake, pressing the berries into the top to hold them in place. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Arrange half of the pie dough strips in parallel rows over the strawberries, about 1 inch apart, using the shorter strips on the ends. Fold back every other strip halfway. Lay one of the remaining strips across the center of the pie, perpendicular to the others. Unfold the strips over the perpendicular one. Repeat, alternating the strips you fold back, to create a lattice top. Trim the overhang. Drape the long pie dough strip around the edge of the plate, on top of the lattice ends. Trim as needed and press the ends together. Tuck the edge of the dough under itself, then crimp decoratively with your fingers.

Cut 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the butter into small pieces and process with the flour until there are no lumps and the mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Pour half the ice water in a large bowl and turn the flour mixture onto it. Sprinkle the remaining water over it, reserving one tablespoon. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl, drizzle the ice water evenly over it and toss like a salad until the dough comes together in a ragged mass. Add the remaining water if necessary. Cover in plastic wrap and chill. Meanwhile, place the remaining butter between layers of plastic wrap and pound with a rolling pin to make malleable. Place it between two sheets of plastic wrap and, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape it into a 6-inch square. Remove the dough from the fridge, lightly flour the work surface and, using either your hands or a rolling pin, shape the mass into 12-inch square. Place the butter on the dough catty-corner and fold the edges of the dough into the center to enclose it. Lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll it into a rectangle measuring about 12 inches high x 26 inches wide. If the dough sticks, loosen it underneath with a long flexible metal palette knife and scrape off any butter sticking to the work surface. Brush off any excess flour. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees, so that seams are parallel to the table&#39;s edge. This is called a \\turn. Lightly flour and roll it out again to about 12 x 26 inches. Brush off the excess flour and again fold it into thirds. Place the dough on a sheet tray, cover it with a plastic bag and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes. Repeat this, giving the dough two more turns, each time rolling it out to 12 x 26 inches. Refrigerate for another 20 or 30 minutes, then give the dough 2 final turns. There are six turns in all. Lightly roll it to flatten and even it. Wrap it in plastic wrap or a bag and chill for at least two hours before using it. It can be kept, refrigerated, for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months. To roll pastry: (for home size 11 x 17-inch sheet trays) For thinly rolled dough (1/16-inch) used to make little pizzas start with 15 ounces (1/3 of the recipe). For thickly rolled dough (3/8-inch) used for everything else, start with 22 ounces (1/2 recipe). Line an 11 x 17-inch sheet tray with parchment paper. On a floured table, roll the rectangle of dough to a length of 15 inches and a width of 10 inches. Dust off any excess flour. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin and transfer it to the sheet tray. Using a 10-inch rolling pin and rolling gently from the center out, roll the dough to fit the tray. Make sure it is even - with no lumpy edges. Rolling lightly and gently enables you to keep it even. Shapes to cut out of the 3/8-inch thick dough: Bouchee: Cut 2 (3-1/2-inch) rounds of dough. Cut a 2-1/4-inch circle out of the second round. Egg wash the first round. Place the ring from the second round over the first so that the edges line up. Dock the edges and center with a fork. Thin inner circle can be baked as well and used for a lid. Bouchee made from special cutter: Use and cutter made especially for this purpose. It has two cutting edges - one inside and shorter than the other that scores, rather than cuts the dough. Criss-cross Tartlet: Cut a 5-inch square. Fold it into a triangle and cut from each edge towards the apex, stopping about 1/2-inch short of the apex. The cut should be about 1/2-inch from the edge. Open it up to the square and place on a cookie sheet. Egg wash the edges. Bring one point over to the opposite corner of the inner square and press. Bring the opposite point over and press. Press along the rim to seal. Dock rim and center. Puff Strip: From a sheet tray of frozen dough, cut a rectangular piece 8\\ wide and the length of the sheet tray. Transfer it to a paper lined cookie sheet. Using a pizza wheel, cut a 3/4\\ strip from each edge. Egg wash the edges of the center piece and flip the cut strips onto the egg washed edge. Dock the 2 rims with a fork, then dock down the center. Vol-au-Vent: Similar to above, but round. Press whatever size round you want into the dough on the sheet tray. Lift and cut along the circular impression with a pizza wheel. Center another round, and inch or so smaller in diameter than the first over the circle of dough and press lightly. Remove and cut along this line. Egg was the edge, as above, and cut through the outer rim in one place. Place the rim over the center circle, lining up the edges. Dock the rim with a fork, then dock the center.

Place a baking sheet on the rack and preheat for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and pour it in a large bowl with the eggs, milk, salt and sugar. Whisk until very well combined. Add the flour and whisk until smooth; pour into a liquid measuring cup. Cut the remaining butter into 12 equal pieces; put one piece in each cup of a 12-cup muffin tin. Set the tin in the oven, on top of the preheated baking sheet, and heat until the butter starts to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Remove the muffin tin from the oven and pour the batter into the cups, filling each about halfway. Return to the oven and bake until the popovers are puffed and starting to brown (do not open the oven door!), about 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and continue to cook (again, without opening the oven!) until the popovers are golden brown all over, 12 to 15 minutes more. Remove the popovers from the tin onto a cooling rack. Let cool until just cool enough to handle, about 3 minutes. For the sandwiches: In a bowl, stir together the horseradish, sour cream and chives. Season with salt and pepper. Working one popover at a time, dollop about a teaspoon of the horseradish cream into the divot on the top of the popover; if the divot is not very deep, push in lightly with your thumb to make a deeper indentation or hole. Top with a slice or two of roast beef and then with another dollop of horseradish cream. Sprinkle with a little finishing salt.

Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure the salt and sugar dissolve. While the brine is simmering, place the ice in a bucket or pot big enough to hold the turkey. Pour the brine over the ice. When the brine has cooled, add the turkey. Place a heavy object like a plate or lid on top of the turkey to keep it submerged in the brine. Refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Position an oven rack on the lowest level of the oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the brine and pat it dry; discard the brine. Tuck the wings underneath the turkey. Sprinkle the turkey inside and out with salt. Put the celery, lemon, onion and parsley into the cavity of the turkey and tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Place breast-side down in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Roast for 30 minutes. For the glaze: While the turkey roasts, combine the pomegranate molasses, 3 tablespoons water and Aleppo pepper in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Adjust heat and simmer, uncovered, until thick and syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the butter and soy sauce and remove from heat. After 30 minutes of roasting, turn the turkey breast-side up and lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Roast 3 hours longer, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh but not touching bone registers 160 degrees F. When the thermometer registers 155 degrees F, or during the last 30 minutes of cooking, begin basting with glaze every 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the turkey from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65865,&quot;Crustless Spinach and Feta Pies 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 (10-ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed 4 scallions, thinly sliced 3 large eggs 3/4 cup half-and-half 1 tablespoon plain bread crumbs 2 teaspoons crumbled dried mint 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Pinch cayenne pepper Freshly grated nutmeg 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese 12 ounces mixed small tomatoes 2 to 3 pepperoncini, stemmed and chopped 2 tablespoons pitted kalamata olives, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Squeeze excess water out of spinach. Add spinach and scallions and cook, stirring, until dry, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a colander and press with the back of a spoon to remove the last bit of moisture. Brush 4 (6-ounce) ramekins with some olive oil and put on a baking sheet. Put spinach mixture, eggs, half-and-half, bread crumbs, mint, salt, black and cayenne peppers, and nutmeg in a food processor and pulse until spinach is finely chopped. Remove blade and stir in feta cheese. Divide mixture evenly among ramekins. Bake until set around the edges but still slightly soft in the center, about 20 minutes.

Fry the fish until golden brown on the first side, about 2 minutes, then flip and cook until golden on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the fish from the fryer and transfer to a wire rack positioned over paper towels or newspaper so that the fish can drain. Season, to taste, with some of the remaining salt, pepper, and Essence. Repeat the process for the remaining of the fish. Serve the fish and chips with slices of lemon or pepper vinegar. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch Published by William Morrow, 1993. Rinse cut potatoes in a large bowl with lots of cold running water until water becomes clear. Cover with water by 1-inch and cover with ice. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days. In a 5-quart pot or Dutch oven fitted with a candy or deep-frying thermometer, (or in an electric deep-fryer), heat oil over medium-low heat until the thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Make sure that you have at least 3 inches of space between the top of the oil and the top of the pan, as fries will bubble up when they are added. Drain ice water from cut fries and wrap potato pieces in a clean dishcloth or tea towel and thoroughly pat dry. Increase the heat to medium-high and add fries, a handful at a time, to the hot oil. Fry, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are soft and limp and begin to turn a blond color, about 6 to 8 minutes. Using a skimmer or a slotted spoon, carefully remove fries from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels. Let rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 hours. When ready to serve the French fries, reheat the oil to 350 degrees F. Transfer the blanched potatoes to the hot oil and fry again, stirring frequently, until golden brown and puffed, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper lined platter and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65902,&quot;French Bread Pizzas 6 tablespoons salted butter, melted 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br> 3 cloves garlic, pressed<br> 1 French loaf, halved lengthwise<br> 1/3 cup marinara sauce 1 cup grated mozzarella 4 ounces pepperoni<br> 1 green bell pepper, sliced into rings<br> 1/3 cup prepared sausage crumbles<br> 1/3 cup black olives<br> 1/3 cup jarred jalapeno slices<br> 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup ricotta 3 tablespoons prepared pesto<br> 1 lemon, zested<br> 1 small zucchini, sliced thin<br> 1/2 cup jarred roasted pepper slices<br> 4 asparagus spears, sliced into 1/2-inch segments<br> 1 cup frozen roasted corn<br> 1 cup goat cheese, crumbled<br> 5 to 6 fresh basil leaves, torn Instructions: For the base sauce: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F.

Line two cupcake pans with 15 cupcake liners, spacing them out evenly between the two pans. Sift together the flour and baking powder in a medium bowl, then lightly stir in the salt and set aside. Combine the heavy cream and 1/2 cup corn in a food processor and puree until smooth, being careful not to overblend so the cream doesn&#39;t turn into butter. Add the sour cream and blend just to combine, then set aside. Cream together the butter, coconut oil and granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed, scraping down the sides occasionally with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is incorporated evenly, until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla. Reduce the mixer to medium-low and add the dry mixture and corn puree mixture in 3 alternating additions, then fold in the remaining 1/2 cup corn kernels with a rubber spatula. Using an ice cream scoop, distribute the batter evenly among the cupcake liners. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the pans and continue to bake until the cupcakes are thinking about starting to turn brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few crumbs on it, 6 to 10 minutes more. If the cupcakes need more time, continue to bake and check them frequently (like every 30 to 45 seconds). Let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the buttercream: If desired, press the cranberry sauce through a fine-mesh sieve to get rid of the cranberry skins, which will yield a smoother buttercream. This step is not necessary, though. Beat together the cranberry sauce, butter and cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until smooth. Add the powdered sugar, salt and vanilla and continue beating until combined. Beat in the heavy cream. Transfer to a piping bag. To assemble: Use an apple corer to extract the centers of the cupcakes. Transfer the thick cranberry sauce to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with the corner snipped off, then pipe it into the centers of the cupcakes. Pipe a blob of frosting onto the cupcakes and decorate with sliced cranberries and rosemary sprigs. Enjoy! These are best enjoyed within a day or two. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 65921,&quot;Saffron Halibut Packets 2 teaspoons saffron threads 1 tablespoon white wine 4 (6-ounce) skinless halibut fillets 1 1/2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed 2 carrots, thinly sliced on the bias Zest and juice of 1 orange 1/4 cup white wine<br> 1 tablespoon butter Kosher salt Bunch green onions, top 1/3 sliced for garnish, and middle 1/3 kept whole* Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon butter Bunch green onions, whites portion only, smashed and coarsely chopped<br> 1 clove garlic, chopped<br> 1 teaspoon saffron threads<br> 2 cups parboiled (long grain) rice<br> 4 cups water<br> Kosher salt Instructions: For the tea: Add the saffron threads to the white wine, and let the flavors steep for 10 minutes.

When one batch is done, add more oil if you need to and continue to brown until all the veal is done. Discard the fat in the casserole and replace it with the butter. Add the carrot, onion and celery, cover and simmer 5 minutes or until onions are translucent. Add the white wine and boil down for a minute or until alcohol has evaporated. Return the veal cubes to the casserole with garlic and add just enough broth to barely cover the veal. Bring the liquid to a boil, add the bouquet garni, put a buttered piece of parchment or brown paper on top of the meat, then a lid on the casserole and set in the oven. Cook for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Remove casserole from the oven and strain the contents through a sieve and the liquid into another saucepan; discard bouquet garni. Divide solids into 2 batches. Degrease the liquid and boil it down until reduced to 3 cups. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the liquid and add it to half of the meat. Return the other half of the veal to the remaining liquid. Season with salt and pepper. Thicken with beurre manie if you wish. Serve with rice, polenta or potatoes; garnish with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65939,&quot;Reindeer Mask Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 pound (about 1 3/4 cups) confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for thickening 2 tablespoons meringue powder<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Dark brown gel food coloring<br> Light Brown gel food coloring<br> 9 red gummy fruit candy halves<br> Instructions: For the dough: Whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Beat together the egg and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br> Reduce the speed to low again and slowly pour in the egg mixture; beat until combined. Add the flour mixture, in 3 additions, increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes.<br> Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide into 2 even pieces. Shape each piece into a flat square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight.<br> To roll, cut and bake the cookies: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Dust another sheet of parchment paper with flour and put 1 piece of the dough on top.<br> Dust with more flour and top with another sheet of parchment. Roll the dough out between the parchment sheets into a square about 1/4-inch thick and place in the freezer for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.<br> From 1 piece of rolled dough, cut out 8 cookies with a 2 1/2-inch cutter and 4 cookies with a 2 1/4-inch cutter. Make the masks by placing 2 of the larger cookies on the prepared baking sheet next to each other so they are barely touching. Place one of the wooden sticks in the middle of the cookies. Place one of the smaller cookies on top of the stick to secure the pieces together. Repeat with remaining cookies, placing each mask about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Refrigerate while you cut the remaining cookies. Reroll any scraps of dough and repeat the freezing, cutting and refrigerating process until all the dough is used.<br> Bake, rotating the baking sheets front to back and bottom to top about halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets set on a wire cooling rack, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, for the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 4 tablespoons water and the vanilla and whip with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes (adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed). The white will be your muzzle, so it needs to be very stiff so that it holds a textured shape.<br> Fit 3 pastry bags with a small tips \\u2013 2 with small round tips and 1 with a small closed star tip. Remove 1 cup of frosting and place in the piping bag with a small closed star tip.<br> Put 1/4 cup of the remaining frosting into a small bowl. Add 12 drops of the dark brown food coloring and whisk until combined. This will be used to outline the cheeks and to draw the mouth, so it needs to be thick but not as stiff as the white. (The food coloring should be enough added liquid but add a drop of water if it is still too thick.)<br> Add 7 to 9 drops of the light brown food coloring to the frosting still in the mixer. Add a few drops of water. Beat until combined and loose, adding more water if necessary. This will be the flood color for the cheeks, so it needs to be loose but not watery.<br> Pipe a line of the dark brown icing around the outer edge of each cheek (the large cookies). This will be the rim that contains the light brown flood so make sure there are no gaps or holes. Repeat with remaining cookies. Once you have finished the edges of all the cookies, check to make sure the first cookie is dry. If not, wait 5 to 10 more minutes until the edges are dry. Then flood each of the cheeks with the light brown frosting. Allow the cookies to dry for 10 to 15 minutes before continuing to decorate (depending on how fast you are, this might be as long as it takes you to flood all the cookies). Once the cheeks are dry, fill the center circle with piped white swirls. Place a red gummy candy halve in the middle of each circle just above the center. Lastly, pipe a mouth onto your mask \\u2013 starting at the candy nose, pipe a small line down that curves out into hooks in opposite directions. Repeat with remaining noses. Let the cookies dry completely before serving and wearing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 65940,&quot;Calypso Corn 1 (10-ounce) package frozen corn kernels, thawed 2 (15-ounce) cans black beans or white kidney beans, drained and rinsed 1 large red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced 1/2 small fresh jalapeno chili, stemmed, seeded, and minced 1/2 cup firmly packed chopped fresh coriander leaves (cilantro) 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine the corn, beans, bell pepper, jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, oil, sugar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.

Toast the pecans on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. remove the nuts from the oven and set aside to cool at room temperature until needed. Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. With the heat on, place the white chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate until completely melted and smooth, about 4 minutes. Transfer the melted chocolate to a 1-quart bowl and set aside. Thoroughly wash and dry the top half of the double boiler. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. With the heat on, place the semisweet chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate until completely melted and smooth, about 6 minutes. Transfer the melted chocolate to a 4-quart bowl. Allow the chocolate to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before proceeding. Add the pecans to the bowl of melted semisweet chocolate. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the pecans until combined. Pour the chocolate pecan mixture onto a nonstick baking sheet with sides and use a rubber spatula to spread evenly. drizzle the white chocolate, one tablespoon at a time, over the entire surface of the chocolate pecan mixture. Use a rubber spatula to spread and blend the white chocolate into the surface of the chocolate pecan mixture creating a marbleized effect (be careful not to overblend which would diminish the marbleized effect). Allow the mixture to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the bark is hard, about 1 hour. Remove the baking sheet from the refrigerator and transfer the bark to a cutting board. Use a cook&#39;s knife to cut the bark into irregular pieces. Refrigerate in a tightly sealed plastic container until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65942,&quot;Butternut Squash Cupcakes, Cranberry Compote Filling and Sage-Cream Cheese Frosting 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar, packed 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 cup cooked, mashed butternut squash 3/4 cup whole milk, at room temperature 1/2 cup chopped pecans, optional Cranberry Compote Filling, recipe follows Sage-Cream Cheese Frosting, recipe follows 1 cup granulated sugar 12 ounces fresh cranberries, rinsed and drained 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature Pinch salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 to 3 cups powdered sugar 2 teaspoons juice from Cranberry Compote 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Roll out the pie dough on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet to approximately 9 by 13 inches, making sure to keep the parchment underneath, as this makes it easier to transfer to a serving platter once baked (see Cook&#39;s Note). Peel the apples and cut them into quarters. Trim away the core, then thinly slice lengthwise.<br> Shingle the apple slices on top of the pie dough so they overlap slightly (they will shrink slightly during baking). You can go right up to the edge of the pastry. Using a pastry brush, brush the apples with the oil and bake until the crust is golden brown and crisp, 30 to 40 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, warm the apricot preserves in a small pan over medium-low heat. Generously brush over the apples to glaze them as soon as you remove the tart from the oven.<br> Gently transfer the tart to a serving platter, making sure to remove the parchment.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Trim off any skin from the ham if needed. Score the ham through the fat in a diagonal crosshatch pattern without cutting into the meat. Place the ham, flat-side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour 1/4 inch of water into the bottom of the pan. Roast the ham until it reaches an internal temperature of about 130 degrees F, about 2 1/2 hours or 15 minutes per pound.<br> Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until soft, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and add the brandy. Return to the heat and continue to cook until the brandy reduces by about half. Add the honey and peppercorns; continue to cook until the mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.<br> Remove the ham from the oven when it has reached 130 degrees F internally. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Spoon or brush some of the glaze all over the ham. Add water as needed to the bottom of the pan. Return the ham to the oven and roast, basting every 10 minutes with the remaining glaze, until well-lacquered and slightly crispy on the edges, about 45 minutes more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 65970,&quot;Rubbed and Sauced Barbecued Baby Chickens 2 (3 1/2-pound) \\baby\\ chickens Olive Oil Salt and fresh ground pepper or Classic BBQ Rub, recipe follows Favorite BBQ sauce or Sassy Brown Sugar and Bourbon Sauce, recipe follows 2 tablespoons smoky paprika 2 tablespoons kosher salt 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cumin 2 teaspoons chili powder 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon celery salt 1 teaspoon oregano, crushed 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar 2 tablespoons molasses 1/2 cup bourbon 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup American-style cl sauce 1/4 cup apple-cider vinegar 1/8 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons Classic BBQ Rub, see recipe 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Build charcoal fire or preheat gas grill. Using poultry shears or a chef&#39;s knife, split chicken down the breast bone to cut the chicken in 1/2. Brush lightly with olive oil on all surfaces and sprinkle with salt and pepper or Classic BBQ Rub. Set aside. Using a rib holder, place the 4 chicken halves vertically skin-side facing out in each of the 4 slots. The chicken in the holder will resemble slices of toast in an old-fashioned toast holder. Place the rib/chicken holder in the center of the cooking grate over indirect medium low heat (making sure no heat is directly under the chicken.) Grill for 1 hour, or until chicken registers 185 degrees F in the thickest part of the thigh. After 30 minutes, check the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Brush liberally with barbecue sauce during the final 15 to 20 minutes only. If the chicken is sauced too early, it will burn on the outside before the interior meat is cooked through. Combine paprika, salt, sugar, brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, pepper, cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt and oregano in bowl; mix well. For a smoother rub, puree ingredients in a spice grinder until well combined and all pieces are uniform (the rub will be very fine and tan in color). This step is important if adding to any homemade barbecue sauce. In a large saucepan on the stove, add tomatoes, sugar, molasses, bourbon, ketchup, cl sauce, vinegars, and Worcestershire sauce, stirring after each additional ingredient to combine. Add the classic spice rub and simmer until the flavors have blended and the sauce has thickened somewhat, about 30 minutes. Let the sauce cool for about 10 minutes or until it is warm but no longer \\boiling\\ hot. Puree using an immersion or traditional blender. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, about 1/2 teaspoon, and freshly ground pepper. Remember, the ribs will have plenty of spice rub on them, so don&#39;t over-season the sauce. Add the cocoa powder and mix well to combine. Let sit 5 minutes and stir again to make sure cocoa powder is well distributed. Let cool and pour into a clean glass jar for storing. The sauce can be made in advance and kept for 2 weeks in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 65971,&quot;Baked Sweet Potato with Sour Cream and Mint 1 sweet potato 2 tablespoons sour cream<br> Fresh mint leaves, for garnish<br> Instructions: Pierce the sweet potato several times with a fork and microwave on high according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes.

Stir in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Season mixture with salt and pepper and set aside. Lay the flank steak flat on the work surface. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture evenly over the steak to cover the top evenly. Starting at 1 short end, roll up the steak as for a jelly roll to enclose the filling completely. Using butcher&#39;s twine, tie the steak roll to secure. Sprinkle the braciole with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the braciole and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add the wine to the pan and bring to a boil. Stir in the marinara sauce. Cover partially with foil and bake until the meat is almost tender, turning the braciole and basting with the sauce every 30 minutes. After 1 hour, uncover and continue baking until the meat is tender, about 30 minutes longer. The total cooking time should be about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the braciole from the sauce. Using a large sharp knife, cut the braciole crosswise and diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Transfer the slices to plates. Spoon the sauce over and serve. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add celery and carrot and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and simmer for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and taste for seasoning. If sauce tastes too acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, to round out the flavor. Pour half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce. If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and then pour 1 to 2 cup portions into plastic freezer bags.

Pat the chicken skin dry with paper towels and season generously with salt. Add chicken skin side down to the pan. You should hear a big sizzle as the thighs hit the pan. Do not try to move the chicken, the skin will stick itself to the bottom of the pan and will unstick itself when it is ready. If the pan is smoking excessively turn the burner down and continue to cook. When the skin is brown and crispy, turn the chicken over and brown it on the other side. Remove the chicken from the pan and reserve. Lower the heat if you have not already done so and ditch most of the excess fat. Add the pancetta and brown. When the pancetta has started to get brown and crispy add the onions. Season with salt and crushed red pepper and sweat over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and saute for 3 to 4 minutes or until they release their juices. Add the wine and reduce by half. Return the chicken to the pan. Add chicken stock to almost cover the chicken. Add the thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the chicken for 30 to 35 minutes. Add more chicken stock, if needed. While the chicken is cooking puree the almonds in the food processor. Drizzle in a little olive oil while the machine is running to make this a loose paste. Season with salt and reserve. Once the chicken has cooked for 30 to 35 minutes, remove it from the pan and reserve. Taste the sauce for seasoning and stir in the almond puree. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer to thicken the sauce, if needed. The almond puree will help to thicken the sauce and to make it very rich. Serve the chicken over Sauteed Haricots Verts or your favorite green vegetable. Spoon the mushroom almond sauce over and garnish with chopped chives. Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of well salted ice water for shocking. Add the beans to the boiling water and cook until the beans are tender but still toothsome about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the boiling water and place immediately into the salted ice water. Once the beans are cool, remove them from the water and set aside until ready to use. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil. Add the garlic and the crushed red pepper and bring to a medium-high heat. When the garlic has become golden and very aromatic, remove it and discard. It has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the beans to the pan and saute until they are hot and coated with oil. Season with salt and serve right away.

Coat the bottom and sides of a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie pan with nonstick cooking spray. Roll the pie dough out, if needed, into a 10-inch round on a lightly-floured surface (or between two pieces of floured parchment paper). If the dough gets too warm, refrigerate it to firm up. Ease the dough into the prepared pie pan. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges as desired. Chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the pecans out on a baking sheet and bake until golden and toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool and separate 1/3 cup; coarsely chop the 1/3 cup pecans for garnish and set aside. Put the pie pan on a baking sheet and line the chilled pie crust with foil or a large coffee filter and fill with pie weights. Bake until the edges are just barely golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the foil with weights, then brush the bottom and edges of the dough all over with the egg white and continue baking until the bottom of the crust is also just barely golden, 8 to 10 minutes more. Transfer to a rack and cool completely. (Par-bake your pie shell up to 1 day in advance.) For the pecan pie filling: Scatter the remaining 1 cup pecans in the bottom of the cooled pie shell. Whisk the corn syrup, brown sugar, butter, egg and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl. Pour the egg mixture over the pecans. Bake until just set, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pie to a rack until cool to the touch. For the apple pie filling: Meanwhile, peel, core and cut the apples into 1/4-inch slices. Toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, then add the apples and cook, gently stirring occasionally, until the apples are soft but still hold their shape, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour and cool completely. (Spread the mixture out on a baking sheet in a thin layer to help cool faster). Pile the cooled apple mixture up and around the edge of the cooled pie (directly on top of the pecan filling) leaving about an 8-inch well in the center of the pie. For the pumpkin pie filling: Whisk together the pumpkin, heavy cream, granulated sugar, egg and spice in a medium bowl. Pour the filling into the center of the pie (directly on top of the pecan filling) with the apples as a border. Bake the pie until the pumpkin center is set with just a slight jiggle, 50 minutes to 1 hour. If the crust gets too brown, cover with foil or a pie crust shield. Let the pie cool completely on a rack. Sprinkle the reserved 1/3 cup chopped pecans around the pie, snug up against the apple filling. Slice and serve with dollops of whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 66000,&quot;Lobster Risotto Arancini 2 tablespoons butter 1 large shallot, finely chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled<br> 1 1/2 cups arborio rice<br> 1 cup white wine, such as pinot grigio<br> 3 cups chicken broth or lobster stock, at room temperature<br> 2/3 cup grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon freshly chopped parsley<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Nonstick cooking spray 2 cups panko 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan<br> 2 eggs, beaten<br> 8 ounces lobster tail meat, chopped into 1/2-inch cubes<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> Instructions: For the risotto: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Reduce the heat to medium low; simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and rose water. Pour into a large liquid measuring cup or heatproof bowl and refrigerate until ready to use (or up to 1 day). Make the baklava: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 375 degrees F. Pulse the nuts, confectioners&#39; sugar and cinnamon in a food processor until coarsely ground. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the vanilla and salt. Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Trim the phyllo to 9 by 13 inches with kitchen shears (fig. A); cover with a damp towel. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo in the prepared baking dish and brush with butter. Repeat with 5 more sheets of phyllo, buttering each sheet. Scatter about 3/4 cup of the nut mixture evenly over the phyllo stack. Top with 2 more sheets of phyllo, buttering each sheet, then top with another 3/4 cup of the nut mixture. Repeat to make 2 more layers (use 2 sheets of buttered phyllo and 3/4 cup nut mixture for each layer), then top with the remaining 6 sheets of phyllo, buttering each sheet (fig. B). Scatter the remaining nut mixture on top. Cut the baklava into 32 triangles (fig. C). Transfer to the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, about 40 minutes (tent with foil if the nuts are browning too quickly). Remove from the oven and pour the prepared syrup evenly over the top. Let the syrup soak in, at least 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 66025,&quot;Marinated Grilled Flank Steak with BLT Smashed Potatoes 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon grill seasoning blend (recommended: Montreal Steak Seasoning) 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, ground chipotle chili powder or ground cumin 2 teaspoon hot sauce - eyeball it 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, 2 splashes 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds flank steak 2 1/2 pounds small red skin new potatoes 1 leek, trimmed of tough tops 4 slices thick cut smoky bacon, chopped, such as applewood smoked bacon 1 cup chicken broth or stock 1 vine ripe tomato, seeded and chopped Salt and pepper 1 cup sour cream, to pass at table Instructions: Mix garlic, steak seasoning, smoked paprika, chipotle or cumin, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and vinegar. Whisk in extra-virgin olive oil. Place meat in shallow dish and coat it evenly in marinade. Let stand 15 minutes. Cut larger potatoes in half, leave very small potatoes whole. Place potatoes in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook potatoes 12 to 15 minutes until tender. Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat. Cut leek in half lengthwise. Chop into 1/2-inch pieces. Place leeks in big bowl of water and release all the dirt from them with a good swish, separating all the layers. Drain leeks in a colander. Grill flank steak 6 to 7 minutes on each side. Put a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil into a hot nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Cook bacon 3 to 5 minutes until it begins to crisp and has rendered most of its fat. Add leeks to the skillet and cook 3 to 5 minutes more until the leeks are tender. Drain the potatoes and return them to the hot pot. Smash the potatoes with the chicken stock. Add the BLT: bacon, leeks and tomatoes to the potatoes and continue to smash. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper to your taste. Remove flank steak from grill and let juices redistribute before slicing. Thinly slice meat on an angle, cutting the meat against the grain.

(If using a vanilla bean, put the vanilla pod in the pot as well.) Add half the sugar to the pot and bring to a simmer (just below a boil). In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar and temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl while whisking constantly (known as a liaison). Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea of a liaison is to incorporate the eggs and avoid making them into scrambled eggs! You want the mixture to begin to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and allow to cool, then remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled. For the pineapple and cherries: In a skillet, bring 1 cup of water and the brandy to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Add the pineapple to the simmering brandy mixture. (Add enough hot water to cover, if necessary.) Poach for about 10 minutes and using tongs, remove to a platter. In the same poaching liquid cook the cherries for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature while you are preparing the batter. For the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Oil the bottom of a 9 by 2-inch deep round pan and lay parchment paper over the bottom. Then brush a thin layer of canola oil on top of the parchment paper. Sift together cake flour and just 1 tablespoon of the sugar several times to aerate. In a separate heatproof bowl combine the eggs and and the other 3 tablespoon sugar. Nest the bowl with the sugar and eggs in another larger bowl filled with about 2-inches hot water. Whisk together the eggs and sugar, being very careful NOT to splash any water into it. The idea here is to raise the temperature of the egg and 3/4 cup sugar mixture to between 100 and 120 degrees F. Use a candy thermometer to test the temperature. Once the mixture is warmed, remove the bowl from the water bowl and use an electric beater to beat it until it is about triple in volume and is the consistency of soft whipped cream. Sift the 1/3 of the flour and sugar mixture into the bowl of beaten eggs and sugar, and fold together. Repeat for each remaining 1/3 of the flour mixture, folding together after each addition. Then, gently fold in the melted butter and vanilla. Arrange the pineapple circles with cherries placed in the center in the bottom of the cake pan. Start the pattern at the middle and work your way out. Pour batter over layer of pineapple, spreading evenly, but don&#39;t fill pan any more than within 1/2-inch of the top edge of the pan. Bang pan on countertop - 1 or 2 times only - to make sure the batter sinks down between the fruit, but don&#39;t overdo it or you will undo all your hard work in aerating the batter! Bake in oven until the surface springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cake cool in pan 10 minutes to allow set up, then using oven mitts, press a serving plate firmly on the top edges of the pan, and invert the cake onto the plate. Replace any pineapple slices or cherries that become dislodged. This cake can be served warm or at room temperature, topped with creme anglaise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 66041,&quot;Fish Fillets Steamed in Lettuce Leaves with Lemon-Dill Sauce 1 1/2 to 2 pounds skinless halibut fillet Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 large head Bibb lettuce 1/4 cup very coarsely chopped fresh dill 6 (4-inch) sprigs fresh mint 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small shallot, finely chopped (about 3 tablespoons) 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh dill 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground white pepper Dill flowers or small dill sprigs Instructions: Check the fish for any stray bones and cut off any dark flesh that was next to the skin. Cut the fillet into 4 equal square pieces. Season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper. Separate the outer leaves from the head of lettuce, without tearing them. Place a leaf cupped side up and center a piece of fish in the middle of the leaf (use two leaves if necessary). Sprinkle the fish with 1 tablespoon of the dill. Top with another 1 or 2 lettuce leaves, this time cupped side down, so that the fish is completely enclosed in lettuce. Wrap the remaining fillets in lettuce, sprinkle each one with dill, and arrange them, without crowding, in a steamer rack or basket. Bring several inches of water to a boil in the bottom of a steamer. Drop in the mint sprigs, put the steamer rack or basket in place, cover and steam fish 8 minutes for each inch of thickness (e.g. if fish is 3/4 inch thick, steam 6 minutes). Turn off the heat, uncover the steamer and let the fish rest for 1 to 2 minutes. To check for doneness, carefully lift the top leave from one of the packets and peek inside the fillet. If it is still translucent in the center, cover and steam for another 1 to 2 minutes.<br> While the fish is steaming, make the sauce. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small saucepan or skillet over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until it is softened but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the lemon zest and juice and bring the mixture to a simmer. Vigorously whisk in the remaining butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, allowing each addition to melt before adding the next. The sauce should be slightly thickened and the butter emulsified. Stir in the dill and season with the salt and pepper to taste.<br> Carefully transfer the fish packets to warm serving plates. Pour the sauce over and around the fish and garnish with the dill flowers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66042,&quot;Chocolate Peanut Butter Burgers (French Macaroons) 2 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus 1/2 cup 1 1/2 cups, plus 1 tablespoon ground almonds 2 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder 5 egg whites 1/2 cup butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup peanut butter, at room temperature 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Make the Macaroons: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line several sheet pans with parchment paper and set aside. In a bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups of the sugar, almonds, and cocoa powder. In another clean dry bowl whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar until medium peaks form (do not beat to stiff peaks). Fold egg whites into dry ingredients to a make a meringue. Fill the pastry bag with the meringue. (To easily fill the pastry bag, place it (with a clothespin holding it shut at the bottom) in a tall round container such as a coffee can, mayonnaise jar, or vase, folding the edge over the rim of the container.) Pipe rows of kisses 1-inch in diameter (about the size of a quarter), keeping them 1/2 inch apart, onto the sheet pans. Bake until very light brown, rotating the pans after 8 minutes, about 17 minutes. Let the macaroons cool on the pan. Meanwhile, make the Peanut Butter Buttercream: In a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the peanut butter and whip. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla and whip until fluffy. Transfer the buttercream to a clean pastry bag fitted with a round tip.

Make sure the water doesn\\u2019t touch the bottom insert. If it does, remove some of the water. Leave the steamer setup on the stove. Spray ten 3-inch fluted egg tart molds with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Whisk the brown sugar, oil and 3/4 cup hot water in a large mixing bowl until the sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Set aside the sugar syrup until completely cool, about 10 minutes.<br> When the sugar syrup is ready, sift the all-purpose flour and rice flour into the syrup in 3 additions, whisking between each addition until there are no dry spots. Stir together the baking powder and 1 tablespoon cold water in a small bowl until there are no dry clumps of baking powder. Whisk the baking powder slurry into the batter in 3 additions until there are no streaks of slurry. Fill the prepared egg tart molds to the top (about 1/4 cup of batter per mold).<br> Bring the water in the skillet to a rolling boiling water over high heat. Set 5 of the molds in the steamer basket, cover and steam until the cakes rise and the tops crack open and resemble a flower, about 15 minutes. (Don\\u2019t open the lid while the cakes cook; doing so interferes with the rising.) Transfer the molds to a cooling rack. Replenish the water in the skillet as needed and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Set the remaining 5 molds in the steamer basket and repeat the steaming process.<br> Serve the cakes warm or at room temperature, unmolding them only when you are ready to eat them. They can be kept, covered in their molds, in the refrigerator for up to a week and reheated by steaming over simmering water for about 10 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 66046,&quot;Cranberry-Orange Cupcakes Cooking spray 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2/3 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon orange zest, plus long, thin strips of zest, for garnish 1/2 cup milk 1 1/2 cups fresh or thawed frozen cranberries 1/3 cup granulated sugar Juice of 1 orange 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Pinch fine salt Instructions: For the cupcakes: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners, and coat the liners and the top of the tin with cooking spray. Whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, clove and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat the sugar and eggs in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. While continuing to beat, gradually pour in the butter, then beat in the orange zest. Adjust the speed to medium-low, and add half the flour mixture. Add the milk, then the remaining flour mixture, taking care not to overmix the batter. It will be thin, like pancake batter; transfer it to a liquid measuring cup to make filling the muffin cups easier. Divide the batter evenly among the cups of the prepared muffin tin. Bake until the tops spring back when pressed, 20 to 22 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The cupcakes can be baked a day ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temperature.) For the frosting: Bring the cranberries, granulated sugar, orange juice and ginger to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves, the cranberries burst and the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Set aside 1/3 cup for garnish. Beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth. Beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Add the cooled cranberry mixture, and beat until completely incorporated. Divide the frosting evenly among the cupcakes, and use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to swirl. Garnish each with a dollop of reserved cranberry sauce and a piece of orange zest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 66047,&quot;Grilled Vegetable Pasta Salad with Parsley Vinaigrette 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper 6 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup finely chopped Italian parsley 1 garlic clove peeled 1 pound tri-colored fusilli pasta 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small garlic clove, finely minced 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 large red bell peppers, seeded, cut in half 2 large ears fresh corn, husked 2 large zucchini, sliced (1/2-inch thick) 1 large red onion, sliced (1/3-inch) Instructions: In a medium bowl, with a whisk, beat together 1 tablespoon vinegar, salt, pepper.

Add onions and cook, stirring every few minutes with a metal spoon or spatula, until a rich chocolate brown color, 30 to 45 minutes. (Do not stir too often or onions will not properly caramelize; stir often enough to prevent onions from burning.) Deglaze pan with red wine and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes. For the short ribs: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat bacon fat in a medium stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the celery, carrots and onions and cook until onions are browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomato paste and stir constantly until well combined and deep red, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in wine and bring to a boil. Add all herbs and garlic and stir in beef stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let braising liquid simmer while preparing short ribs. Trim excess fat from short ribs and cut into four 5- to 6-ounce portions. Sprinkle all sides of the short ribs with salt and pepper. Brush bottom of a large Dutch oven with a little vegetable oil and heat until smoking hot. Add short ribs. Brown all sides and turn off the heat; turn off the heat to the braising liquid as well. Carefully ladle all the braising liquid along with the herbs and vegetables over the short ribs. Cover cook in the oven, 4 hours. Using metal tongs, carefully remove each short rib from the braising liquid and set aside to cool. Strain braising liquid. Discard vegetables and herbs, reserving liquid. Set aside. Raise oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Slice short ribs and remove any excess fat. Heat braising liquid in a medium pot.

Top with the Sushi Rice and spread in an even layer, leaving 1/2-inch at the bottom end. Make a small channel in the center of the rice across the nori strip. Lay the tuna, wakame and carrot in the channel. Using the sushi mat as a guide, fold the nori over the filling and roll into a cylinder. Slice into pieces. Lay out the sheet of nori on a sushi mat, shiny side down. Top with the Sushi Rice and spread in an even layer, leaving 1/2-inch at the bottom end. Make a small channel in the center of the rice across the nori strip. Lay the salmon, cucumber and carrot in the channel. Using the sushi mat as a guide, fold the nori over the filling and roll into a cylinder. Slice into pieces. This recipe will make 1 quantity of rice, which is sufficient for 2 uncut large rolls or 4 uncut small rolls or 16 finger sushi. This is the basic technique for producing the glutinous, vinegar-flavored rice that forms the basis of all types of sushi. Matured, Japanese or Californian short-grain rice is essential. To vary the quantity of cooked rice, remember that the ratio of uncooked rice to water should be 1 part rice to 1 1/4 parts water. Start by washing the rice thoroughly until the water comes clear. Let the rice drain for 30 to 60 minutes. This will allow the grains to absorb moisture and start to swell. Put the rice, water and kelp in a pan with a tight fitting lid. Bring the mixture to the boil over a medium heat, removing the kelp just before the boiling point. Cover the pan and simmer for about 10 minutes. (Simmering time will vary depending on the quantity of rice.) Resist the temptation to lift the lid while the rice is cooking. Turn off the heat, remove the lid and cover the pan with a tea towel. Leave to cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together the rice vinegar, caster sugar and salt in a pan. Heat until the sugar dissolves, then remove from the heat and pour the sushi vinegar into a cool bowl. To stop the vinegar distilling off, sit the bowl in cold water to speed cooling. Using a wooden rice paddle, spoon the rice into a rice tub or bowl. Spread it out evenly, then run the paddle briefly through the rice cutting it first from side to side, then from top to bottom. Continue cutting - never mashing or stirring - the rice, adding the sushi vinegar a little at a time. At the same time, ask someone to fan the rice to cool it. It should take about 10 minutes to mix in the sushi vinegar thoroughly and bring the rice to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 66072,&quot;Blood Orange Martini 4 ounces vodka 1/2 ounce triple sec or flavored orange liqueur 2 ounces blood orange juice 2 blood orange slices Instructions: In a martini shaker combine all ingredients except the orange slices with a generous amount of ice.

Combine the yeast, salt, sugar and 2 1/4 cups of the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and stir to combine. With the mixer running, add the water and oil. Beat until the dough comes together, about 2 minutes. If the dough is too wet, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it is still soft and slightly sticky, but you can turn it out. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the calzones: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix together the mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan in a medium bowl. Set aside. Lightly flour a work surface. Turn out the dough and divide it into 4 pieces. Gently pull and stretch each piece of dough into a 7- to 8-inch round, trying to keep the thickness of the dough fairly even. Lay out the rounds and spoon one-quarter of the cheese mixture onto one side of each round (about 1/2 cup per round). Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the Homemade Pizza Sauce onto the cheese. Add up to 1/3 cup of your preferred topping onto each of the calzones, then fold the side of the dough over the fillings. Fold and crimp the edges to seal them completely. Transfer the calzones to the prepared baking sheet and brush them lightly with oil. Use a sharp paring knife to cut 1 or 2 vents into each, then bake until deep golden brown, about 18 minutes. Serve with additional Homemade Pizza Sauce on the side, if desired. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the oregano, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil and 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, with the saucepan loosely covered in foil to avoid splattering and stirring occasionally, until fairly thick, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on your tomatoes. Remove the basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Chianti]&quot; 66115,&quot;Honey Roasted Cipollini Onions 15 cipollini onions Extra-virgin olive oil About 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar 1/3 cup honey 1/2 bunch thyme, leaves removed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Seasoned Salt<br> 4 tablespoons hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s RedHot?, plus more for spreading and serving, optional One 12- to 14-inch soft French loaf (not a baguette), split Olive oil, for the bread Seasoning salt, such as Lawry&#39;s? Seasoned Salt, for the bread Coarsely ground black pepper 1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced 1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese (1 ounce), such as Gorgonzola Instructions: For the ribs: Prepare a grill for direct and indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the side burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling. Insert a butter knife between the membrane and bone on the back of the rack of ribs. Grab the membrane with a paper towel to grip it, then pull off the membrane and discard. Sprinkle both sides of the ribs with the brown sugar and seasoning salt and rub it in. Wrap the ribs tightly in aluminum foil and set on the indirect-heat side of the grill. Cook, turning the package once, until the meat is tender and pulling away from the bone but not totally falling apart, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove from the grill but leave the grill on. For the slaw: Meanwhile, whisk together the mayonnaise, lemon juice, seasoning salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Add the cabbage, carrot, celery, celery leaves and parsley and toss to combine. Season with additional seasoning salt and pepper if needed.<br> Unwrap the ribs and let cool until you can touch the ribs without burning your fingers. With a knife, slit the skin on the back of the ribs and carefully pull out the bones, keeping the slab in one piece. (Use the knife to help hold down the meat while pulling out the bones.) Move the boneless slab to the direct-heat side of the grill, rounded-side up, and brush the top with 2 tablespoons of the hot sauce. Grill until the underside begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the slab and brush the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons hot sauce. Continue to grill the ribs until they&#39;re glossy and caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes more.<br> For the sandwich: Scoop out most of the soft insides of the top of the French loaf to make room for the toppings. Brush the cut sides with oil and sprinkle with seasoning salt and pepper. Grill on the direct-heat side of the grill until the bread has grill marks and is nicely toasted, about 3 minutes.<br> Place the ribs on the bottom of the loaf, brush with additional hot sauce, if desired, and top with the slaw, onions and blue cheese. Top with the top of the loaf. Cut into 4 pieces. Serve with extra hot sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 66123,&quot;Orange Chipotle Pork Ribs 1 rack pork spareribs, cut in half (about 3 1/2 pounds) 2 tablespoons chipotle in adobo 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon honey 3 cloves garlic Juice of 3 oranges, plus 2 teaspoons grated orange zest 1 medium onion, chopped 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon lime juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the ribs in a roasting pan. Put the chipotle, soy, honey, garlic, orange juice and zest and onion in a blender and blend until smooth. Pour over the ribs. Add the bay leaves and enough water to almost cover the ribs (about 3/4 cup). Cover with foil and bake until the meat is fork tender and very soft, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove the pork from the pan and pour the liquid into a saucepan to reduce until it is a glaze-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the ribs in a single layer on a baking sheet or broiler pan and brush with the glaze.

Bring to a rolling boil and gently add the whole eggs. Boil for 9 minutes then immediately transfer to a bowl of icy water to stop the cooking. Let the eggs cool completely, then peel and set aside. Place a large piece of parchment on your work surface. Arrange 8 bacon slices horizontally on the parchment. The edges of the slices should touch but not overlap. Working with the remaining 7 slices and stretching each slightly to make it the length of the 8 slices, weave the bacon in an over-under pattern to create a woven lattice design.<br> Turn the parchment paper so that one of the short sides is in front of you. Using your hands, spread and press half the sausage in an even layer over the bacon. Next, lay 4 slices of ham on top of the sausage, overlapping the pieces slightly and leaving a 1-inch border around the edge between the sausage and ham. Cover the ham with the American cheese slices in a single layer, overlapping the cheese slightly if needed. Cover the cheese with another layer of ham.<br> Arrange the remaining sausage lengthwise in the center of the ham. Press it into a 5-by-9-inch rectangle positioned crosswise across the center of the ham (the longer side of the sausage rectangle should be in front of you). Put the eggs in a line down the center of the sausage rectangle, so that the tips are touching. Fold the sausage rectangle up and over the top of the eggs so they are encased. Using the parchment under the bacon as a guide, wrap the layered meat around the egg-filled sausage to form a roll; arrange with the seam on the bottom and shape the roll to be as round of a cylinder as possible. Wrap the parchment paper tightly around the rolled meat, transfer to a baking sheet and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.<br> Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For a gas grill (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For a charcoal grill, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results). Place the meat roll seam-side down over the indirect heat side of the grill. Cover and cook until the bacon is browned, about 20 minutes. Turn the roll and cook seam-side up until golden all over and cooked through, about 20 minutes more. Transfer the roll to the direct heat side of the grill and cook, turning the roll once, so the bacon crisps, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the roll to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Cut into thick slices and serve sandwiched in the cinnamon rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 66125,&quot;Sticky Toffee Pudding 6 ounces pitted dates 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup light brown sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 large egg, at room temperature 1 tablespoon orange zest 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons Irish whiskey Instructions: For the pudding: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the dates and 3/4 cup water to a small saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Turn the heat down to low and simmer until the water has slightly reduced and the dates are beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, then cover the saucepan and let sit for 10 minutes. Transfer the dates and liquid to a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process until smooth. Pour the date mixture into a bowl and cool to room temperature. Add the flour, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl. Whisk to break up any lumps of flour. Set aside the dry ingredients. Add the brown sugar and butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream the butter and sugar together, scraping down the bowl as needed, until fluffy and lighter in color, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the egg and beat until it is evenly combined. Add the orange zest and vanilla and mix until incorporated. Add half of the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Mix until incorporated, then add the date mixture. Mix until well combined, then add the remaining flour mixture. Mix until just combined. Spray 8 of the cups in a 12-cup muffin pan with the cooking spray. Fill the greased cups with 1/3 cup batter each. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes. For the whiskey toffee sauce: Meanwhile, add the heavy whipping cream, brown sugar, butter, vanilla and salt to a small saucepan and heat over medium-high heat. Stir the mixture continuously until the butter is melted. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the whiskey and continue to simmer until the sauce has slightly darkened in color, an additional 2 minutes. Turn the heat off and keep covered until ready to serve. Cool the puddings in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Once the puddings are cool enough to handle, remove them from the muffin pan using an offset spatula. Trim the domed tops from the puddings and set them on serving plates, cut-side down.

Rest for 8 hours at room temperature, until the batter is light, full of bubbles, and roughly doubled in size. (If you&#39;d like to make these for breakfast, you can refrigerate the batter overnight after this 8-hour rest.) Stir the egg yolk, butter, sugar and salt into the starter mixture until just combined and set aside. Beat the egg white and cream of tartar with a hand mixer on high until stiff peaks form, about 1 to 2 minutes, then fold the egg white into the batter using as few folds as possible to keep it from deflating (see Cook&#39;s Note). Rest the batter at room temperature for 20 minutes. Heat a Belgian waffle iron on medium heat. When hot, lightly coat both plates with nonstick spray. Ladle the recommended amount of waffle batter onto the iron according to the manufacturer&#39;s recommendations and cook until crisp and golden brown. Serve immediately or cool on a rack and wrap in plastic wrap followed by foil and freeze for up to 3 months. To begin: Mix together 125 grams flour and 125 grams water with a clean hand in a medium glass bowl. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let sit undisturbed at room temperature until the mixture is full of bubbles and has nearly doubled in size, usually 2 to 3 days. During this time, yeasts and bacteria from the air and from the flour and probably from you will set up housekeeping in the bowl (see Cook&#39;s Note). For daily feeding: Peel back any crust that may have formed and transfer 20% of the culture (50 grams) to a clean, wide-mouthed jar. Stir in 100 grams flour and 100 grams water, loosely screw on the lid and stash at room temperature for 24 hours. (The culture will have a stinky-sour smell at this point.) Discard the rest of the original mixture. Repeat step 2 every 24 hours for 5 days. By then the culture should smell yeasty-sweet-sour, which means you&#39;re ready to put the starter to work. The waffles are to be made with the discarded percentage of starter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 66129,&quot;Fire Roasted Snapper Wrapped in Green Corn Husks with Charred Corn-Charred Jalapeno Salsa, and Jalapeno Pesto 6 ears corn 8 jalapeno chiles Canola oil for brushing, plus 2 to 3 tablespoons Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 small red onion, finely diced 2 limes, juiced 1 to 2 teaspoons honey Cilantro, to taste 4 red snapper fillets, 8-ounces each 4 limes, halved String for tying fish Corn Milk and Jalapeno Pesto Sauce, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups cilantro leaves 6 grilled jalapenos, from recipe above 2 cloves garlic 2 tablespoons pine nuts Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Corn cobs, from recipe above Instructions: Remove the very outer husks from the corn.

Using a large skillet with a heavy bottom, heat the olive oil over low heat and saute or \\sweat\\ the onions until translucent, being careful not to allow them to color or brown at all. Add the arborio rice, stir to coat with the olive oil, and saute with the onions to toast each grain of rice, about 7 minutes. This toasting process adds the chewy, al dente quality that attracts so many people to risotto. Once the rice is lightly toasted, add the white wine slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon. (A wooden spoon is always preferable when making risotto, as a metal spoon tends to cut or injure the grains of rice. Constant stirring should be avoided for the same reason.) Preheat the chicken stock just to the boiling point, then have it ready at stoveside. After the rice has absorbed the white wine and the skillet is nearly dry, add one cup of chicken stock, stirring occasionally, and cook over very low heat until the stock is absorbed by the rice. Continue adding the stock, a cupful at a time, until all the stock has been absorbed. (Adding the liquid in stages, instead of all at once, allows the grains of rice to expand more fully, adding to the risotto&#39;s creamy texture.) Once the rice has been added to the pan, the entire cooking process will take about 17 to 20 minutes. After all of the liquid has been added, and the rice is chewy yet fully cooked, with a creamy texture; add the butter, Parmesan cheese, and the heavy cream. Stir to combine all the ingredients and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 66144,&quot;Orange-Ginger Grilled Short Ribs 4 cups fresh orange juice 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 3 tablespoons tamari 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns Kosher salt and coarsely ground pepper 2 whole star anise pods 1 2-inch piece fresh ginger, sliced into rounds 1 2-pound piece boneless beef short rib, sliced against the grain into 1/4-inch- thick pieces 1/4 cup canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped salted peanuts 2 scallions (green and pale green parts only), thinly sliced<br> 1/2 teaspoon packed light brown sugar Pinch of ground allspice Pinch of ground cinnamon Kosher salt Instructions: Make the glaze: Combine the orange juice, brown sugar, tamari, peppercorns, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper, the anise and ginger in a medium saucepan.

Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally, at least 6 hours or overnight. Pour 1/4 cup of the oil into a large saucepan. Heat the oil over high heat to 350 degrees. Add the leek and cook for 1 minute, until golden brown, being careful no to let the hot oil splatter. Using a slotted spoon, remove the leek from the oil and place on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil. Reserve. Remove the turkey cubes from the marinade, discarding the marinade. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels and place in a medium mixing bowl. Sprinkle the flour over the turkey cubes and toss to coat thoroughly. In a large skillet, cook the turkey in 2 tablespoons of the oil over high heat for 5 minutes, until brown. Add the onions, celery, and carrots, and saute for 5 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are crisp tender. Add the sherry to deglaze the pan, loosening any browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, until the liquid is reduced by 1/2, about 30 minutes.

Dip each oyster, first into the flour, then the egg, then the cornmeal to evenly coat. Place the coated oysters on a baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to fry. Pour the oil into a deep-fat-fryer or 4-quart heavy saucepan. Heat the oil over high heat to 350 degrees (if you drop a small amount of the cornmeal mixture into the oil and it sizzles, it&#39;s hot enough). To prevent the coated oysters from sticking together, carefully drop them into the heated oil 1 at a time. Fry the oysters, a few at a time, for 2 minutes, until golden. Using a slotted spoon, remove the oysters from the oil and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Serve with lemon wedges.

Line mini muffin tins with white mini cupcake liners. Prepare the cake batter according to the package directions for using egg whites. Fill each cupcake liner halfway with batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Repeat with the remaining cake batter (you should have about 240 cupcakes total).<br> Microwave the white candy melting wafers in a medium microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted, about 1 minute. Pour 2 tablespoons of the melted candy onto the center of a large serving platter or serving board (such as a 15-by-20-inch foam poster board). Place a 10-inch Styrofoam sphere on top of the candy and let set until hardened, about 10 minutes. This will be the bottom round of the snowman. Trim 2 inches off the flat end of three 12-inch wooden skewers, making sure that the skewers are even in length. Mark the center of the sphere and poke the 3 skewers, bundled together, into the center flat-end first, leaving about half the length of the skewers sticking out of the top. Align a 7-inch Styrofoam sphere on top and in the center of the 10-inch sphere and press down so the skewers are inserted into the smaller sphere, securing the snowman head to the bottom. Leave a 1-inch gap between the 2 spheres.<br> Set aside 5 cupcakes for making the nose later. Coat the bottom of 16 cupcakes with the melted candy (reheating as necessary) and wedge them around the base of the bottom sphere so they are in contact with the board, creating a ring of cupcakes to keep the base from moving.<br> Poke a toothpick through the top center of each of the remaining cupcakes until the toothpick pokes out of the other side. Coat the bottom of one cupcake with some of the melted candy. Starting at the bottom of the snowman, hold the top of the toothpick and poke the cupcake into the side of the sphere, offset between the row of cupcakes below, so that the toothpick is no longer showing and the coated bottom is pressed against the sphere. Working in batches so that the melted candy does not harden (and reheating as necessary), repeat with the remaining cupcakes until the bottom and head of the snowman are completely covered with cupcakes.<br> To make the carrot nose: Crumble the reserved 5 cupcakes into as fine a crumb as possible in a medium bowl. Add the vanilla frosting to the bowl and mix until well combined and the mixture can be formed into a stiff ball. Mold into a 4-inch carrot shape. Cut a 12-inch wooden skewer in half; discard the half without the point. Insert the skewer half lengthwise through the center of the carrot with the pointed end sticking out of the flat side of the carrot. Freeze until solid, about 30 minutes.<br> Microwave the orange candy melting wafers in a medium microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Dip the frozen carrot into the orange candy until completely coated. Transfer to a parchment-lined dish until hardened, about 15 minutes.<br> Attach the carrot nose to the center of the face with the pointed end of the skewer, pressing in until the skewer is no longer visible and the carrot is straight.<br> For the frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer bowl above the water without the bottom of the bowl touching. Add the sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the mixer bowl and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until the mixture is cool and holds stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Transfer a quarter of the frosting to a large pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Pipe rosettes onto each cupcake starting in the center and swirling outwards until the entire cupcake is covered with frosting, refilling the pastry bag with frosting as needed.<br> To make the eyes and buttons: Cut 3 toothpicks in half and discard one of the halves. Stick the pointed end of each remaining toothpick half into the back of a chocolate-covered marshmallow cookie, making sure it doesn&#39;t poke through the front. On the head where the eyes would be, attach 2 marshmallow cookies to 2 cupcakes with the toothpicks. Attach 3 marshmallow cookies to 3 cupcakes down the front of the snowman where the buttons would be.<br> To make the ear muffs: Cut two 12-inch wooden skewers in half; discard the ends without the point. Insert a skewer point-side first into each side of the snowman head even with the eyes. Trim any excess skewer to leave 1 inch exposed. Attach a doughnut to each side of the head by pressing the doughnut into the skewer until it is flush with the head and pressing against the frosted cupcakes. Lay the two 9-inch sour candy strands next to each other across the top of the head to attach the ear muffs. Trim any excess if needed. To make the woven scarf: Stack four 3-foot-long sour candy strands on top of each other and position vertically in front of you. Measure 4 inches down from the top of the strands and insert a toothpick through all 4 pieces to attach them at the top. Separate the strands below the toothpick so they are no longer stacked on top of each other. Interlace the far-right strand first under the strand next to it, then over the strand next to that and finally under the last strand (on the left) to create the first weave, tightening as you go to create a snug pattern. Continue the pattern by bringing the same strand back over the strand closest to it, then under the next strand and finally over the last strand on the far right.<br> Repeat this pattern--weaving side to side and back again--until the strand has been completely woven through. Using a toothpick, attach another 3-foot strand where the original one left off and continue until the new strand is woven through. Cut the remaining unwoven strands at the bottom. Use toothpicks to secure the scarf. Repeat this process, starting with four new 3-foot sour candy strands and weaving in a fifth, to create 2 woven scarf halves equal in length.<br> Fray the unwoven section at the top of the scarf halves by pulling the different colors apart. Attach one of the scarf halves to the back of the snowman, securing it with toothpicks. Wrap the scarf carefully around to the front of the snowman so the frayed end drapes near the buttons. Secure the other scarf half, overlapping in the back if needed, and wrap around to the front of the body so the ends of the scarves overlap.<br> Keep chilled until serving. Serve within a day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66155,&quot;Serrano-Wrapped Sherry Shrimp 12 large prawns or jumbo shrimp, tail on and deveined 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 1 lemon, juiced 1 stem fresh oregano or marjoram, leaves stripped and finely chopped<br> EVOO, for drizzling Hot sauce, such as Tabasco Fat handful fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 12 slices Serrano ham<br> Olive oil, for sauteing<br> 1/2 cup dry sherry<br> 2 tablespoons butter<br> Instructions: Toss the shrimp with the garlic, half of the lemon juice, the oregano, a fat drizzle of EVOO, a few shakes hot sauce, the parsley and some salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp in a slice of ham. Drizzle some olive oil in a large skillet and heat over medium-high to high heat. Add the shrimp and cook until the ham is brown and crisp and the shrimp are firm and pink at the ends. Remove the shrimp to a platter. Pour the sherry in the pan, swirl, then add the butter and the remaining lemon juice, and swirl to gloss the sauce.

Arrange the tomatoes, garlic, bread, and nuts on a baking sheet; roast for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a food processor and pulse to roughly break up. Add the pimentos, vinegar, oil, and paprika. Pulse again until well combined, add salt. This sauce is best if allowed to rest so the flavors can meld (may be made a day in advance). Heat oil to almost smoking in a large skillet or roasting pan. Toss the prawns in half the romesco sauce to coat, and pan sear the shrimp quickly in the oil just until barely opaque. Then roast for 10 to 12 minutes in a 450 degree F oven. Serve the remaining sauce on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66158,&quot;Multi-Grain Rice Pilaf 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons pine nuts 1 cup Wehani brown rice 1/2 cup wild rice, preferably whole, not broken 1/2 cup farro, an Italian hulled wheat also known as spelt 5 cups water 1 long strip lemon zest 3 sprigs fresh thyme 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 bunch scallions (white and green), thinly sliced (3/4 cup) 1 lemon, juiced (about 1/4 cup) Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pine nuts and swirl the pan until the nuts toast, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the brown and wild rice and the farro and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until lightly toasted. Stir in 5 cups water, the lemon zest, thyme, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook undisturbed for 45 minutes. Check the texture of the rice, and if needed, continue simmering until tender and the liquid is absorbed, another 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, scatter the scallions and lemon juice over the surface of the pilaf and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork, stirring in the scallions, remove the herb sprigs and serve.

Lay out a 12-by-16-inch piece of parchment paper. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the sugar mixture evenly on the paper. Lay the puff pastry on top and sprinkle with another 1/2 cup of the sugar mixture. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch square, pressing the sugar into the dough with the rolling pin. Roll up the dough tightly into a log. Wrap in the parchment paper and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Slice the log into 1/2-inch-thick rounds and place 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. (If the spirals unravel, pinch them back together.) Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes. Bake until the pastry is puffed and light brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the remaining sugar mixture. Return to the oven and bake until the cookies are glazed and golden, 10 to 15 more minutes. Use a spatula to transfer the warm cookies to another sheet of parchment paper, flipping them over before the sugar hardens. Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66160,&quot;Santorini Warm Country Feta Phyllo pastry sheets from 1 frozen package (recommended: medium or thick style, if available) 1 1/2 pounds Greek feta cheese, in block form Vegetable or sunflower oil, for frying 3/4 cup Greek honey 2 tablespoons black sesame seeds 1 small jar candied figs, or fig jam Instructions: Thaw the frozen phyllo pastry sheets in the refrigerator overnight, and then bring these to room temperature prior to use for easier handling. Drain the feta cheese from the brine. Cut the block of feta using a thin, sharp knife into 6 slices, approximately 2 by 4 inches and 1/2-inch thick. Set the slices on a clean kitchen towel to dry. Lay the phyllo sheets on a flat surface and cut with kitchen scissors or a small sharp knife to size. They should be cut into rectangles, approximately 8 by 12 inches. Use a ruler if needed. Lay 1 cut piece of phyllo in front of you like a sheet of wrapping paper - the 12-inch length top to bottom. Place a slice of feta at the top end of the sheet slightly below the edge and wrap it up as you would a small package. Fold the top end of the sheet over the feta and then fold the left and right sides over. Flip the partly wrapped feta down the sheet towards you until it is fully wrapped. If needed, a little water can be used to seal the last edge of the sheet onto itself. Set aside with the sealed edge on the bottom of the package so the weight keeps the phyllo closed. Do not stack packages on top of each other. Continue to wrap all the pieces of feta. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep sided skillet using sufficient oil to float the package, about 3 to 5 inches of oil. Fry to a golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side. The pastry should puff up slightly. Remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Serve each package on an individual plate or, if on a serving platter, do not stack the packages. Drizzle each package with about 2 tablespoons of honey and sprinkle with a teaspoon of black sesame seeds. Top with cut pieces of candied fig or a teaspoon of chunky fig jam. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 66161,&quot;Mighty Duck with Potatoes One 12-ounce can orange juice concentrate 15 whole black peppercorns 4 cloves garlic, smashed 1 bunch fresh thyme 1/2 cup kosher salt, plus additional for seasoning One 5 1/2- to 6-pound frozen Long Island duck, thawed 1/4 cup Grade A maple syrup 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1 pound Red Bliss potatoes, quartered Freshly ground black pepper 2 shallots, minced 2 handfuls shredded chard Dash sherry or balsamic vinegar Instructions: Combine 10 ounces of the orange juice concentrate with 1 can of warm water in a bowl (reserve the remaining concentrate for the glaze). Combine the orange juice, peppercorns, garlic cloves, thyme and 1/2 cup salt in a plastic container with a lid. Place the lid on the container and shake to dissolve the salt. Remove the pop-up thermometer, liver, gizzards and heart from the duck. Cut off the wing tips. Using kitchen shears, locate the spine at the base of the neck. Cut up the line of the backbone towards the neck cavity. Turn the duck and cut straight towards the rear cavity. Remove the backbone. Turn the duck over and cut straight down the middle of the breastbone, leaving 2 equal duck halves. To separate the legs from the breast, flip your halves over so the flesh side is facing up at you. Using the knife, make a crescent-shape cut between the leg and the breast. Line the inside of a plastic lexan or a pot with a zip-top bag. Place the duck quarters inside the bag and pour the brine over the duck. Seal the bag, ensuring that all the air is removed. Brine the duck for 2 to 2 1/2 hours in the refrigerator. Bring 1 1/2 inches to 2 inches water to a boil in a large pot. Place a colander into the pot and line the sides of the colander with the duck. Do not stack the duck quarters on each other. Cover and turn the heat to medium-low. Steam the duck for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place a large cast-iron skillet in the oven to preheat on the center rack. Carefully remove the steamed duck (do not throw out the water) and lay it on a cutting board. Lay your knife flat against the skin and make 3 marks in one direction and then in the other, making an X. Make sure that you are cutting through the skin and not the meat. Score all pieces. Remove the skillet from the oven, add just the legs skin-side down and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and add the breasts skin-side down and cook 7 minutes more. Combine the maple syrup, red pepper flakes, remaining orange juice concentrate and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat until the sauce just generously coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven, flip the duck pieces over, brush with the glaze and return the skillet to the oven to brown the skin until crisp and a deep mahogany brown, 3 to 5 minutes more, or until the legs are 160 degrees F and the breasts register 140 degrees F. Remove the duck from the skillet to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet and loosely tent with foil. Meanwhile, steam the potatoes in the same water that you steamed the duck over medium heat until they slide off a paring knife when stabbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes. Remove and save 1 tablespoon of the fat from the skillet. Heat the skillet on medium-high heat and add the potatoes. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Then flip the potatoes and cook 3 to 5 minutes more. Drain the potatoes on a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt and pepper. Add the tablespoon reserved duck fat back into the skillet and heat on medium heat. Add the shallots and saute until translucent, about 2 minutes. Toss in the chard and cook until it just barely wilts. Season with the vinegar. Slice the duck breast thinly on the bias. Serve the duck with the sauteed chard and duck fat fried potatoes.

Taste and adjust the seasonings. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use (this can be made a day or two in advance). Heat the remaining tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for a minute. Add the spinach, a few pinches of salt and 2 tablespoons water and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and wilted, about 4 minutes. (You may need to add the spinach in batches if it&#39;s too much to fit in all at once.) Season with pepper and squeeze in the lemon juice. Turn the heat down to low just to keep this warm while you poach the eggs. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Crack the eggs one at a time into a small bowl, then carefully lower the eggs into the boiling water. Cook until the whites are firm but the yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove to a paper towel or clean kitchen towel to dry off any excess moisture.<br> Toast or grill the pitas. Drizzle with a little olive oil and top with the spinach and eggs. Spoon on the feta cream and sprinkle with fresh black pepper and a pinch of Aleppo or paprika. Enjoy! Mix together the warm water, yeast and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running on low speed, add the salt and oil, then gradually add the flour. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix, adding just enough additional flour so that the dough no longer sticks to the bowl, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, 7 to 10 minutes. (Do not add too much flour.) Lightly coat a clean large bowl with oil or cooking spray, then place the dough in the bowl and turn it once or twice to coat it in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Turn the dough onto a clean work surface and divide it into 24 equal pieces. Mold each piece into a ball by stretching the top and tucking the edges under. Place the balls 1 inch apart on a piece of parchment paper, then cover them with plastic wrap and let them rise for 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. With a rolling pin, roll out the balls of dough into 3-inch circles, dusting with flour as needed. Place them on the lined baking sheets and bake until they&#39;re puffy and just starting to brown, about 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 66177,&quot;Bananas Paletas 2 medium bananas, about 3/4 cup 1/4 cup sugar 1 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Special equipment: Plastic ice pop mold or use paper cups with wooden sticks inserted.

In a saute pan, cook the sausage patties. Remove from the pan and place on bottom half of each biscuit. Add butter to the sausage fat and melt. Crack the eggs into the pan and cook to desired doneness. Top the sausage with a slice of cheese and then top with fried eggs. Place the other half of each biscuit on top of the eggs and smother with the sausage gravy. Mix water and milk in a stock pot and slowly heat. Do not boil. In a cast-iron skillet, cook the sausage. The meat should be chopped frequently while cooking to give it a ground beef consistency. When the sausage is well done, carefully strain and save the grease and then add the meat to the water and milk. Put the grease back in the skillet over moderate heat. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper to make your roux. Cook this mixture until it will cling to the spoon and come off the skillet cleanly. When the milk and water mixture is just under boiling, stir in the sausage roux while turning off the heat to thicken the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 66179,&quot;Smoked Chicken Nachos 1 whole chicken 2 pounds wood chips (flavor of choice) 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 bags vegetable chips or tortilla chips 2 heirloom tomatoes, diced 4 jalapenos, sliced very thin 2 cups sour cream 1 cup cilantro leaves 1 cup chopped chives 1 pound goat cheese wrapped in plastic and kept in the freezer Instructions: Preheat an outdoor grill and split the chicken in 1/2 from head to tail. Soak the wood chips in water for about 10 minutes. This will prevent the wood chips from burning as soon as they come in contact with the fire. Place the wood chips in the bottom of a grill below the grates. Set the flame on 1 side of the grill to medium and the other side to medium high. Place the chicken, skin side up, on the medium side of the grill. Cover and allow the chicken to smoke and grill at the same time. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes. Allow the chicken to cool completely before shredding the meat off the bones. Reserve for the assembling of the nachos. Form an assembly line with all of the ingredients. Start with the serving dish, then the chips, chicken, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream, cilantro and chives. Right before they are served, remove the cheese from the freezer. Using a fine side of a box grater, shave the goat cheese over the top of the nachos. Chef&#39;s Note: Paper vessels can be purchased at a wholesale restaurant or party supply store. I recommend using individual serving dishes that are 5 inches by 3 inches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 66180,&quot;Bahamian Steamed Conch 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 large Spanish onion, sliced 1 medium green sweet pepper, sliced 1 medium red sweet pepper, sliced 3 tablespoons tomato paste 4 medium plum tomatoes, chopped 3 sprigs fresh thyme 5 pounds conch meat (tenderized with a mallet, steamed and cut into large chunks), liquid reserved 1 red cl pepper, chopped Salt Instructions: Heat oil in a saute pan.

Fill a 14-inch cast-iron pan with the rock salt. Shuck the oysters, keeping them in their bottom shells, then lay them on the rock salt, using care to save as much of the oyster liquor as possible. Place the entire pan in the oven and cook until the oysters are just set, 5 to 6 minutes. Meanwhile, add the bacon to a medium cast-iron pan, then set over medium-high heat. Cook the bacon until the fat has rendered out and the bacon begins to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the onions to the pan and turn the heat down to medium-low. Sweat the onions until they have begun to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the mustard, then slowly add the vinegar, stirring. (You will want to stir and swirl the pan as you add the liquid, to help emulsify the mustard and vinegar into the bacon fat.) Add the watercress and stir the mixture to combine and wilt the cress. Remove the oysters from the oven. Evenly divide and top each oyster with the bacon vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 66182,&quot;Steak and Brie Bites 24 crostini crackers 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for toasting the crostini 1 1/2 pounds New York strip steak<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup whole-grain mustard<br> 2 tablespoons salted butter<br> Two 8-ounce wheels Brie, cut into wedges 1 cup jarred roasted peppers, drained and sliced<br> 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves<br> 1/4 cup shaved Parmesan<br> Instructions: Briefly toast the crostini crackers on each side in hot olive oil in a skillet until glistening and crisp.

Simmer for 20 minutes then take off stove and let steep an additional 30 minutes. Strain infused liquid and re-heat with the honey to a simmer. In a stainless steel bowl whisk together the 10 yolks, cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sugar. Temper the yolks by adding only a ladle of hot infused cream to the yolks. Mix well then add tempered mixture back to the saucepan. On medium heat, whisk constantly until it thickens then cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes. A pastry cream texture should be achieved. Transfer base to a baking dish, seal with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. Base can be made 24 hours in advance. Pre-heat a sheet tray in a 375-degree oven. Whisk the egg whites with 1-tablespoon of sugar in an upright mixer equipped with a whip attachment on slow. In about 8 to10 minutes soft peaks will be achieved. Add the rest of the sugar and whip at high speed for two 5 second bursts. In a large stainless bowl, hand whisk the chilled infused cream base until smooth. Using a spatula, gently fold in the egg whites. Work quickly, but do not over mix. The base needs to be one homogenous color. Fill ramekins to the top. Drop each one from a height of 3 inches onto the counter to disperse any unwanted bubbles. Place on heated sheet tray and bake for 12 minutes. After 6 minutes the souffles will start rising. Check the rising souffles to see if any edges are getting caught on the rims of the ramekins; if necessary open the oven door and carefully slice the sticking part with a paring knife (you won&#39;t ruin the souffles if you work fast). The souffles will straighten themselves out. When the sides of the souffle are golden brown (the key to a souffle not falling is the crusty, golden brown sides), pull out of the oven and dust the tops with confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve immediately with a scoop of lemon grass ice cream. In a non-reactive saucepan, simmer milk with lemon grass and reduce by 1/3 percent. If there&#39;s enough time let the lemon grass steep in the milk overnight. Strain out lemon grass and heat with sugar and vanilla bean/pod. Bring to scalding. Hand whisk the yolks in a stainless steel bowl. Temper the yolks by adding only a ladle of hot milk to the yolks. Mix well then add tempered yolks back to the sauce pan. Whisk constantly on medium heat for 2 minutes. Strain and cool in an ice bath. When mixture is cooled add heavy cream. Follow manufacturer&#39;s instructions for your particular ice cream maker. Place in freezer before serving. PLATING: Place souffle on plate. Cut an opening in the top of the souffle and put a scoop of ice cream inside.

Add the flour, sugar and salt and blend, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed, until smooth, about 1 minute. Cover and let the batter rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Re-blend the batter just before cooking. Heat a nonstick crepe pan or 10-inch nonstick saut pan over medium heat. Coat the pan with a small amount of butter and allow it to froth and bubble. Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into the center of the pan and lift and swirl to spread the batter evenly over the bottom of the pan in a circular motion. When the crepe begins to set, the edges get a little lacy and the bottom gets a little color, about 1 minute, carefully flip with a spatula. Continue cooking until lightly browned on the second side, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a plate or sheet pan. Repeat until the batter is used up, stacking the crepes as made. (You should have about 8 crepes.) For the sauce: In a 10-inch skillet, bring the juice to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the sugar and continue to simmer until the juice reduces down by two-thirds, or until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Melt half the butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add half the orange segments, half the zest strips and half the reduced orange juice and allow the orange segments to soften and the liquid to reduce, about 1 minute. Fold each crepe in half, and then in half again to form triangles. Add half the folded crepes to the sauce in a single layer, then allow them to be gently coated in the sauce. Flip and coat the other side. Add half the orange liqueur to the pan and allow it to reduce slightly. Pour half the cognac into the pan, then tip the pan to catch the flame and ignite the sauce. (Alternatively, use a long stick lighter to ignite the liquor.) Allow the flame to burn off the alcohol. Transfer the crepes to plates and serve with the Whipped Crme Fra?che. Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients to make 2 more servings. Lightly whisk the crme fra?che and vanilla paste in a chilled bowl until the crme fra?che is slightly loosened up and the vanilla is incorporated. Chill until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66225,&quot;Buttermilk Onion Rings Vegetable oil, for deep-frying 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup rice flour 1 cup finely grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping 3 tablespoons mustard powder 1 tablespoon paprika 1 teaspoon garlic powder Kosher salt 2 cups buttermilk 1 cup dark beer, such as porter or stout 2 tablespoons dijon mustard 2 medium onions, peeled and cut into 1/3-inch-thick rings Instructions: Fill a fryer or large Dutch oven with 2 inches vegetable oil; heat to 330 degrees F to 340 degrees F. Prepare the batter: Whisk the all-purpose flour, rice flour, parmesan, mustard powder, paprika, garlic powder and 2 tablespoons salt in a large bowl. Whisk the buttermilk, beer and dijon mustard in a separate large bowl. Add all but 1 cup of the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk to make a smooth batter, similar to a pancake batter. Test 1 onion ring: Dip in the batter and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. If the batter is still not cooked through, then it is probably too thick; add a splash more of the wet ingredients to the batter. (You may also need to add more of the wet ingredients to the batter as it sits.) Working in batches, dip the remaining onion rings in the batter and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack. Immediately sprinkle with more parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 66226,&quot;Red Rice 1/3 cup vegetable oil 3 cups long grain rice, rinsed* 1 medium onion, chopped 5 serrano chiles, or to taste, stemmed, seeded if desired 2 garlic cloves, chopped 3/4 cup chicken stock, Vegetable Stock (see recipe), or water 3 cups Red Tomato Salsa, see recipe Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
