Enjoy this wine in 2C3 years, or age for 10.","designation":"","title":"Bouchard P re &amp; Fils 2006  Clos de Vougeot"},{"country":"US","description":"A great California bubbly, right up at the top. It's unusual for a sparkling wine house to hold back their basic vintage brut this long, but J did, and consumers benefit. The wine has some bottle age, and is softly picking up nutty, dried fruit, floral and yeasty notes. Enormously complex, it should continue to develop for many years.","designation":"Vintage Brut","title":"J Vineyards &amp; Winery 2000 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"fr","description":"With its distinctive bouquet of rose petals and lychee fruit, this dessert wine's Gew rztraminer character shines clearly through a modest veil of botrytis.

This is a deep-fruited modern specimen with that elusive mix of floral, fruit and meaty characteristics. The palate is ripe and everlasting, with berry, coffee and hickory flavors. Long and calm on the finish, with amazing texture. An excellent encore to the prior year's achievement.","designation":"El Puntido","title":"Vi?edos de Paganos 2005 El Puntido  (Rioja)"},{"country":"US","description":"Pretty much as gorgeous as California bubbly gets. It's dry and yeasty and rich in citrus, peach and apple flavors, with an enormously fine structure. Feels smooth as silk, clean as a whistle, with a delicate but complex mousse.

Schram Sparkling (North Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.","designation":"","title":"Girard 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)"},{"country":"US","description":"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent. This is one for the cellar and will age for at least a decade and probably far longer.

In a word, gorgeous. There's a soft silkiness, a caressingly smooth mouthfeel that just seduces the palate into submission.

Best now through 2010.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Laetitia 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Here is an ageworthy wine, a proper grand cru. The spice from the wood is the dominant factor to begin with, and this needs more time to integrate.

The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.","designation":"Padrone Proprietary Red Wine","title":"Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"es","description":"Talk about a wine that makes you take notice. This is simply great modern Rioja. The nose is creamy but honest, with black fruit, mocha and finely tanned leather.

Ultra stylish and delicious; another huge success for the Eguren family that owns San Vicente and other Rioja properties.","designation":"","title":"San Vicente 2005  Rioja"},{"country":"US","description":"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point.

The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.","designation":"Flor del Montg  Old Vines","title":"Montg  2006 Flor del Montg  Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud)"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's an easy-drinking wine that's packed with Gew rz character.

It's dry, with berry, currant and spice flavors, and kind of rustic. Calls to mind barbecue.","designation":"","title":"Heringer 2006 Teroldego (Clarksburg)"},{"country":"US","description":"Sweet, smoky oak dominates this Chard, giving a caramelized, vanilla custard taste to the underlying pineapple fruit. Fans of this style will enjoy it.","designation":"Chalk Hill Estate Vineyards","title":"Rodney Strong 2006 Chalk Hill Estate Vineyards Chardonnay (Chalk Hill)"},{"country":"fr","description":"A fresh, very strawberry and plum skin flavored Pinot Noir from Irancy, a small area near Auxerre and close to Chablis. The wine has some weight because of the vintage, which gives ripeness and an edge of rusticity. It's certainly more than just a curiosity.","designation":"","title":"Simonnet-Febvre 2005  Irancy"},{"country":"cl","description":"Quite  varietal  in that it hits with sweaty, nutty grapefruit aromas. Airing allows the white fruit components in the wine to show themselves, and thus lemon and tangerine work the palate. Finishes sort of thin and narrow, with more acidity than body or depth of flavor. Good but on the sharp side.","designation":"Reserva","title":"Ventisquero 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Made from the two Cabernets plus Merlot, this is a forward, tasty but somewhat one-dimensional red wine.

Once it airs out, however, it's a good, generic Cabernet with familiar flavors of black fruits, mocha and chocolate. It's a little herbal and lean across the palate and onto the finish, but for run-of-the-mill everyday Cab it does the trick.","designation":"Estate Bottled","title":"Finca El Portillo 2007 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Plump and fruity on the nose, but it also smells entirely familiar and generic. Like most Argentine Cabernets, this wine is tight, tannic and full of cassis and other berry fruits. What it's not is elegant, complex or different than the masses. If you like bold but basic berry flavors, tannic bite and chocolate on the finish, this is for you.","designation":"Remolinos Vineyard","title":"Finca Decero 2006 Remolinos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Agrelo)"},{"country":"ar","description":"A heavy, blocky wine with a dark color and aromas that lean toward raisin and reduced balsamic vinegar. The palate is quite full and slightly syrupy in feel, while the flavors are of boysenberry and dark, toasty oak. Finishes with even more crusty, espresso-like wood flavors, leaving displaced wood as the lasting impression.","designation":"Casa","title":"Familia Marguery 2006 Casa Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"Has some green tomato flavors and minty tannins that give an astringent feel to the otherwise plush cherry and cola fruit.

Shows a nice spectrum of citrus, yeast and strawberry flavors that finish dry, crisp and clean, if a little rough. Drink now.","designation":"Brut","title":"Piper Sonoma NV Brut Sparkling (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"US","description":"A problematic wine. It's too tannic and closed to enjoy now, and the fruit flavor may not be powerful enough to withstand aging. Then there's the sweaty taste that provides a jarring note, and may be tamping down the fruit.","designation":"","title":"Pine Ridge 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Light and waxy on the nose, with touches of custard, lychee and banana. This is not a driving, varietally convincing Torront s, but it is balanced and refreshing. The flavors of melon and apple are solid, while the finish is quick but nice. Drink right away and it shouldn't be a disappointment.","designation":"","title":"Bodega Norton 2007 Torront s (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit too oaky for balance, with a strong toasted wood aroma and flavor that smothers the underlying fruit flavors of currants, cherries, blackberries and plums.

Drink now.","designation":"","title":"Halter Ranch 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)"},{"country":"US","description":"Much like the 2005 Hogue Reserve, this is a deep gold and fragrant with candied pineapple, buttered nuts and toast.

But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.","designation":"","title":"Finca El Portillo 2007 Malbec (Uco Valley)"},{"country":"gr","description":"This Sauvignon Blanc from gr is in step with the general Greek white wine style: refreshing, clean and approachable.

Simply good and a definite Asian food and seafood cohort.","designation":"Amethystos","title":"Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2007 Amethystos Sauvignon Blanc (Drama)"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry and hot, with high alcohol framing herb- and pepper-tinged cherry flavors.

Fans of Port should give it a try.","designation":"Imperial","title":"Achaia Clauss NV Imperial  (Mavrodaphne of Patras)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Quite neutral and distant on the nose, with dry apple flavors working the soft, balanced palate. There are complexities such as white pepper and nutty nuances, but in the end it's an average sparkler with a controlled approach.

Drink right away for maximum freshness.","designation":"Conde de Valdemar","title":"Bodegas Valdemar 2007 Conde de Valdemar Viura (Rioja)"},{"country":"es","description":"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things.

Not likely to improve.","designation":"","title":"Hagen Heights 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit on the green, feline side, but with enough lemon and lime and sweet oak influences to give it richness.

Should develop gracefully over the next 10C12 years.","designation":"Cyrus","title":"Alexander Valley Vineyards 2004 Cyrus Red (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"fr","description":"A ripe, soft wine that still does manage to preserve the Ayala lightness of touch.

The paperwork says it's from Knights Valley, although the label reads Sonoma County.

For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages.

It shows the kind of elegance and grace one finds in Bordeaux, without intrusive barrel influences, and it's the kind of nose you want to bury your nose in. It wraps around you seductively, with an appealing shyness. The fruit and wood and earth flavors are seamless and interesting, as the wine leads you gently through a very long finish.","designation":"","title":"Stephenson Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)"},{"country":"US","description":"The vineyard is up in the Mayacamas between Spring Mountain and Sonoma Valley, and the wine shows quite a bit of power. Coming from this hot vintage, it's also very ripe and fruity, in a California way. But it's classically structured and dry, and the tannins are softly complex. This delicious, ageable Cab is a worthy followup to the '03.","designation":"Brigden Vineyard","title":"Owl Ridge 2004 Brigden Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"US","description":"A young, fresh Pinot that requires a little cellaring, although decanting for a few hours will help open it up.

Represents a real step forward in Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon.","designation":"","title":"Falcone 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)"},{"country":"US","description":"This was one of the best Rieslings of the year last vintage, and the '07 is even better. It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years. Balancing that is a broad, complex array of citrus, peach, apple, flower, petrol, mineral and spice flavors.

Drink now.","designation":"Primum","title":"Salentein 2004 Primum Malbec (Uco Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Io has a really good track record with this Syrah, which is grown in Paso Robles.

Apples and cream flavors round the wine very satisfactorily.","designation":"Premier Cru Brut","title":"Aubry NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)"},{"country":"US","description":"A very rich, layered Pinot that stands out for its depth and ageability.

Like their regular '05, it's a very tannic wine, not suitable for drinking now or possibly anytime soon.

Masi's Mazzano is a benchmark wine for Valpolicella thanks to its intriguing complexity of aromas: black cherry, dried fruit, porcini mushroom, dark chocolate, vanilla bean and dark resin like the kind you'd smell in an antique furniture shop.

Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision.

Lemon peel, candied pineapple and even grapefruit add lovely grace notes indicative of rich, clean, natural acids and a wine with plenty of glycerin.

It's as voluptuous as any Pinot in California, offering waves of ripe, fleshy cherries, red currants, licorice and smoky vanilla that just don't stop in palate appeal. For all that, the wine is elegant, silky and refined. Delicious now, although a little tannic, and will benefit from decanting and aging.

The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together.

About 20% was aged in new oak, but the influence is barely noticeable, as a gentle background, giving light scents of toast and hints of butterscotch.

It's an easy and genuine wine overall that will pair with lamb or pork.","designation":"","title":"San Rustico 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico"},{"country":"US","description":"There's 5% Malbec in the blend, but the austere, scrapey tannins of the Franc still dominate the finish. The fruit is pretty, with blueberry character to burn. The wine hits the palate well in the beginning, but seems to sag a bit midpalate before heading into that astringent finish, enlivened by toasty new oak. If you like blueberries, you'll like this wine.","designation":"Weinbau Vineyard","title":"Three Rivers 2006 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)"},{"country":"US","description":"Nothing subtle about this strongly flavored Merlot, which smacks of perfectly ripened red and black currants, toasty oak and violets. It's a big, flashy, full-bodied wine and also a very tannic one. Best to age for a few years, or at least give it long decanting.","designation":"","title":"Swanson 2005 Merlot (Oakville)"},{"country":"US","description":"Tart and sleek, this estate-grown fruit  has appealing elegance. The fruit is almost transparent, but not invisible, with very clean, high acid flavors of green berry, apple and pear. There is a layer of butterscotch that fills in the finish, without taking away from the finesse.","designation":"Estate-Barrel Select","title":"Tsillan Cellars 2006 Estate-Barrel Select Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Very dry and racy in acidity, Taz's basic county-wide Pinot shows good Santa Barbara character. Its cherry, currant and spice flavors will play nicely against a charbroiled steak or seared tuna.","designation":"","title":"Taz 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)"},{"country":"US","description":"With its tough, gritty tannins and forward cherry, red currant, orange and raspberry flavors, this light-bodied Merlot will pair well with something savory and fatty.","designation":"Estate","title":"Rutherford Grove 2006 Estate Merlot (Rutherford)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a good, proper Pinot Noir rather than an exciting one. It's as dry as dust and crisp in acids, with an earthy, tobaccoey undertow to the modest cherry-cola flavors. Drink now through 2010.","designation":"Leras Vineyard","title":"Russian Hill 2005 Leras Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit hot and indelicate, but very ripe, with currant jam and blackberry pie-filling flavors richly layered with smoky, caramelized oak.

From the warm, eastern part of Santa Ynez Valley known as Happy Canyon.","designation":"Vogelzang Vineyard","title":"Foxen 2005 Vogelzang Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Even in his less-expensive wines, such as this Columbia Valley Merlot, winemaker Charlie Hoppes gets excellent color extraction. Along with the color come stiff, substantial tannins; once in the mouth, however, the wine sets a different course, turning rather light and fruity. Tart cherry and wild berry flavors quickly give way to thick tannins and barrel flavors of baking chocolate.","designation":"","title":"Fidelitas 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"More like Zin than Merlot, a peppery, full-bodied wine with some ripe to overripe blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors.

The wine is less deep and more hard and scratchy than some Mendoza Malbecs, but it's solid and sure-footed even if the mouthfeel is stark. Probably better with food than others due to its leaner, less opulent style.","designation":"","title":"Felipe Rutini 2006 Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"Made in an immediately appealing, oaky way, this Chard has appealing peach, pear, green apple and honey flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie.

Michelle 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Surprising scents of clover and mint rise up from the glass, leading into a round, fruity, substantial wine with good cherry fruit and some earthy tannins from the 5% Cabernet Franc in the blend. The wine has not completely knit together, but a good steak could fix that.","designation":"","title":"Canoe Ridge 2005 Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Plenty of charcoal, toast and resin work the bouquet, while the fruit seems a little candied.

Gets it more right than wrong.","designation":"Premium","title":"Alta Vista 2006 Premium Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a sweet and round and forward Merlot, at least upon entry. Then it takes a right angle turn, adding more astringent flavors of rock and earth and green tea. It's not quite Jekyll &amp; Hyde, but it's not entirely pulled together. It needs a substantial piece of grilled meat to help soften those finishing tannins.","designation":"","title":"Bergevin Lane 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"A successful blend of Roussanne and Viognier that impresses for its complex swirl of fruits and spices, and maintains a clean, healthy balance.

Best now through 2010.","designation":"","title":"Highway 12 2005 Merlot (Sonoma Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"A little light in body and flavor, with dried Proven?al herb flavors and a hint of cherry.

In the mouth, it is full, the mousse is tight and the acidity is not completely balanced with the fruit, which will almost certainly need more time to blend together.","designation":"Fleur de Ros  Brut","title":"Beaumont des Cray res 2003 Fleur de Ros  Brut  (Champagne)"},{"country":"US","description":"Although many will find this Chard fancy and worth the price, the oak sticks out too much, giving it outsized butterscotch and toast flavors. Maybe something less than 40% new oak would have let the tropical fruit, citrus and pear flavors express themselves more purely.

Will be interesting to see where it goes.","designation":"Integrity","title":"Ballentine 2003 Integrity Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is too ripe and obvious for its own good. It's very good, offering a vast wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and chocolate flavors, but you find yourself wishing that, at this price, it had greater structure and was a little more aloof and tantalizing.","designation":"Blend 25","title":"B Cellars 2005 Blend 25 Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Noteworthy for lush, slightly sweet flavors of mashed black cherries, espresso and dark chocolate, this gooey Grenache is from a well-known vineyard.

It's a dense and syrupy wine that is meaty and solid in the mouth without being cloying or sticky.","designation":"Kabir","title":"Donnafugata 2006 Kabir  (Moscato di Pantelleria)"},{"country":"fr","description":"A great structured wine that keeps freshness and fine black fruits all in play. This mid-range wine from Luc de Conti has a firm sense of style, but also offers the potential for mid-term aging. It is not super-concentrated; more elegant, poised and classy.","designation":"Moulin des Dames","title":"Chateau Tour des Gendres 2005 Moulin des Dames Red (C?tes de Bergerac)"},{"country":"it","description":"A gorgeous blend of Cabernet and Negroamaro, this is one of Puglia's best red wines. The Cabernet element adds accents of spice and blackberry and the Negroamaro grounds the robust wine to its territory. The tannins are tight and firm and suggest that Nero could do with a few years of bottle aging.","designation":"Nero","title":"Conti Zecca 2005 Nero Red (Salento)"},{"country":"es","description":"As close to a New World style of white wine as you're going to find in es has to be Chivite Colecci n 125. It's mostly Chardonnay, and with a nose of popcorn, butterscotch and baked white fruits, it somewhat resembles a fine effort from Burgundy or California. But this is Spanish, and the flavors of pineapple, lemon and walnuts are good and the feel is rich and serious. Drink now into 2009.","designation":"Coleccion 125 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica","title":"Bodegas Juli n Chivite 2005 Coleccion 125 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica White (Navarra)"},{"country":"US","description":"A very elaborate Chardonnay showing flavors of exotic fruits, spices, buttered toast and cream. Charred oak and acidity currently dominate, making the wine a little rigid, but a year or two in bottle should soften and sweeten.","designation":"Ritchie Vineyard","title":"Bjornstad 2006 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"Cembali is a fruity and powerful oak-aged Nero d'Avola with characteristic notes of marzipan, pistachio paste, cherry liqueur and a touch of spicy rum cake. The wine's fruity highlights should integrate with the natural spice with one or two more years of cellar aging.","designation":"Cembali","title":"Baglio di Pianetto 2004 Cembali Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)"},{"country":"pt","description":"From the Monc?o region, heartland of Alvarinho, at the north of Vinho Verde, this is a delicious wine, its green flavors bursting out of the glass. It is fresh, very crisp, edged with yeastiness but then boosted by its tight acidity.","designation":"","title":"Aveleda 2007 Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows real upscale character in a Cabernet from a n gociant with a proven ability to deliver. With rich, firm tannins and classic balance, its flavors range from ripe crushed blackberries and currants to herbs, tobacco, olive tapenade, dark chocolate and smoky oak.","designation":"Lot 73","title":"Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 73 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)"},{"country":"US","description":"This soft, seductive wine carries itself with a captivating voluptuousness. It's balanced and pretty, and the mix of fruits from four AVAs takes you in some interesting directions, like plum and peach and cherry. There are no rough edges, just lovely aromas and moderate (13.9%) alcohol. Natural yeasts only were used, and the wine was bottled unfined and unfiltered.","designation":"La Paul e","title":"Scott Paul 2006 La Paul e Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)"},{"country":"es","description":"A rock-solid gran reserva with tobacco, tomato leaf, pepper and lovely dried fruit aromas. The palate is round and comfortable, with tobacco, baked fruit and brown sugar flavors. Pure and silky on the finish, with length. Excellent aged Rioja with a more traditional character than many of the new-wave wines are showing.","designation":"Gran Reserva","title":"Valserrano 2000 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)"},{"country":"pt","description":"An impressive, finely balanced wine, which wears its ripe fruit, dark chocolate and sweet plum flavors easily and opulently. The tannins are rounded, never dominant.","designation":"Touriga Nacional","title":"Quinta da Pacheca 2006 Touriga Nacional Touriga Nacional (Douro)"},{"country":"at","description":"The wine's name refers to the high density 8,000 plants per hectare (3,200 per acre). Hans Setzer follows the current wisdom that high density planting produces greater concentration. And this is definitely a powerful expression of ripe fruit, herbs, spice, ripe red apples and some wood. Big and rich, it finishes with a burst of pepper.","designation":"Cuv e 8000","title":"Setzer 2007 Cuv e 8000 Gr ner Veltliner (Nieder?sterreich)"},{"country":"US","description":"Grown just down the hill from the Bien Nacido Vineyard, this Pinot shows many of the same characteristics. It's dry, balanced and ripe, with blackberry, black cherry and orange flavors enriched with dusty Asian spices. With a fine, silky mouthfeel, it should develop over the next 4C6 years.","designation":"Rancho Ontiveros Vineyard","title":"Waltzing Bear 2005 Rancho Ontiveros Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)"},{"country":"es","description":"Dry and nicely oaked, with hints of fine aged cheese, campfire, dried fruits and leather. The palate is a little more fruity than the nose, but still it's dry and tight, with raspberry and cherry flavors. While some acidity sits on the surface, overall this gran reserva is tasty, fresh and more than likable. Drink now through 2013.","designation":"Gran Reserva","title":"Marqu s de Riscal 2000 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)"},{"country":"pt","description":"Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouchet (10%) give a fine mix of dark tannins and big berry fruits, plus just a touch of fresh juiciness from the Alicante. The tannins shine through the wood flavors, giving a dense structure which goes with the sweet plum juice and acidity. An impressive, powerful wine.","designation":"Touriga Nacional","title":"Casa de Santa Vitoria 2006 Touriga Nacional Touriga Nacional (Alentejano)"},{"country":"US","description":"The Harrison Hill vineyard has some of Washington's oldest Cabernet vines. Here the blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot offers a distinctive flavor profile, clean, sharp and herbal, with an interesting, earthy note. Flavors mingle beautifully, and carry through from the tart, tight-knit red fruit into the polished and lightly slatey tannins and a chewy, lightly peppery finish.","designation":"Harrison Hill Red Wine","title":"DeLille 2005 Harrison Hill Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley)"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is wonderfully rich and dense, with dry and dusty tannins that float in the depths of the powerful black fruits, well integrated with the wood. This is impressive Malbec, showing its juicy qualities allied with its huge tannins. It could do with 3C4 years' aging.","designation":"K Lys","title":"Clos Troteligotte 2005 K Lys Malbec (Cahors)"},{"country":"at","description":"A blend of Chardonnay and Gr ner Veltliner, this wine certainly shows Chardonnay richness, with yellow fruit, peach and apricot over a smooth softness. The element of Gr ner lends some spice, while wood gives added richness. Hard not to drink now, but aging over 3C4 years would show its potential.","designation":"Weisse Reserve Vom Schloss","title":"Graf Hardegg 2005 Weisse Reserve Vom Schloss White (Nieder?sterreich)"},{"country":"US","description":"There are three benches at the estate vineyard  west, north and south-facing. This 100% Syrah is a blend of two of them. You get the more earthy Northern Rh?ne attributes; exotic scents of herb and cured meat not bacon fat from the barrel but legitimate flavors from the terroir. In 2006 it's tight, edgy and still youthful; this is an ageworthy Syrah that will expand and develop over the next 6C8 years. For the moment, it needs decanting to show its best. After breathing, as the wine opens, new layers of flavor emerge: soy, vanilla, raisin and buttered nuts.","designation":"Seven Hills Vineyard Estate","title":"L'Ecole No. 41 2006 Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))"},{"country":"at","description":"The richest of the Gr ner Veltliners from the Krems cooperative, this has power as well as the ripest fruit. The flavors are of pear, melon and freshly ground spice, edged with a green apple skin texture. There is depth of flavor, the fruits going right into the core of the wine.","designation":"Wachtberg","title":"Winzer Krems 2007 Wachtberg Gr ner Veltliner (Kremstal)"},{"country":"US","description":"A big, brawny, juicy Zin that shows the muscular style of Rockpile, and does so with considerable appeal. With powerhouse flavors of ripe, freshly picked blackberries and currants, sprinkled with anise, cocoa, black pepper, crushed cloves, star anise and vanilla, it finishes completely dry and smooth.","designation":"Jack's Cabin Vineyard","title":"Bella Vetta 2005 Jack's Cabin Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)"},{"country":"it","description":"This floral wine is bursting with notes of jasmine and honeysuckle backed by sweet fragrances of candied fruit and caramel. The wine is sweet and thick in the mouth but the well-dosed acidity keeps it from being cloying or too fat. It would pair well with slightly sweet foods such as honey glazed ham or lobster.","designation":"Plus","title":"Bastianich 2005 Plus Tocai Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Low yields, old vines and 2 years' lees aging are the basis of this concentrated wine. It is rich, full, very intense, but doesn't lose sight of strong minerality. Certainly a wine for aging, this is only just beginning its ripe development.","designation":"L'Ancestrale","title":"Chateau du Coing de Saint-Fiacre 2002 L'Ancestrale  (Muscadet S vre et Maine)"},{"country":"US","description":"The 2005 is 45% Grenache, 35% Mourv dre, 15% Syrah and 5% Counoise. The model is Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Intense, smoky and loaded with jammy fruit, especially lots of ripe raspberry, and nicely delineated tannins, with a smack of baking chocolate in the finish. Once again, the Grenache dominates, an explosion of raspberries, plenty of buoyant acid, and a tart and nervy mouthfeel. Long, clean, very concentrated; it's a joy to drink.","designation":"Sirocco Red Wine","title":"McCrea Cellars 2005 Sirocco Red Wine Red (Washington)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the first year that Grenache has been used in the blend, and it really juices it up. Packed with fresh raspberries, set up with tart acid, this wine really piles on the red fruit/grape juice flavors. The alcohol (over 15%) is surprisingly high, but it's not hot or jammy, because the acids really cut through. In the mouth the wine delivers a lot of spice, cranberry, plum and light pepper. The tannins are substantial but not intrusive, and show a bit of pencil lead and rock.","designation":"","title":":Nota Bene 2005 Syrah (Washington)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is 57% Merlot and 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's just this side of voluptuous. Scented with rose petals, violets, chocolate and graphite, it offers generous cranberry and raspberry fruit, svelte and racy. Given the structure and acids, it's got a better than even chance for a long life ahead.","designation":"Conner Lee Vineyard Red Wine","title":":Nota Bene 2005 Conner Lee Vineyard Red Wine Red (Washington)"},{"country":"US","description":"The blend is 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc. It opens with a lot of caramel and vanilla up front, keeping the black cherry and cassis fruit more towards the back. Streaks of herb, coffee and rock wrap into the finish. Still young and compact, this wine needs much more time to really unwrap itself.","designation":"Ciel du Cheval Vineyard","title":":Nota Bene 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},U={class:"card-container"};function N(o,t,i,u,y,a){const p=g("PoemCard");return n(),r(h,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",U,[(n(!0),r(h,null,m(a.visiblePoems,(l,f)=>(n(),b(p,{key:f,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=c(x,[["render",N]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"wine/51.md","filePath":"wine/51.md"}'),D={name:"wine/51.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(o){return(t,i)=>(n(),r("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{L as __pageData,F as default};
