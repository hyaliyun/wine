Quite approachable right now; it should drink well for the next 4 to 8 years, maybe longer.","designation":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"it","description":"The brilliant deep-ruby color is a harbinger of things to come.

There are some slightly drying tannins on the finish, so try it with rich or fatty foods for best effect.","designation":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"fr","description":"Krug prefers to call this wine multivintage rather than nonvintage, but that doesnt change what it is. Deep yeast, butter and cider aromas lead into full caramel and apple flavors on the weighty palate; it turns a bit sweet-tart on the finish. Perhaps made with juice from some weaker vintages of the early 1990s, its nonetheless very good.","designation":"Champagne"},{"country":"fr","description":"This intriguing wine displays an almost fum-style smoky minerality on the nose, followed by flavors of pear and toast.
