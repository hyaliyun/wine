The cool vintage gives it refreshing acidity, while the flavors are ripe and frankly delicious, suggesting pineapple and Key lime pie, vanilla custard, buttered toast, vanilla and dusty pie spices.

Drink after 2015.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"This 100% Cabernet spent nearly two years in 100% new French oak. As a result, it's enormously oaky in youth. You can barely smell or taste anything beyond toothpicks.

Earthy, forest-fire aromas coat black cherry notes in the bouquet; the palate's bark, oak and bacon flavors come from time in old American oak barrels. Creamy and simple, but a steal.","designation":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"fr","description":"This Bordeaux white is heavily oaked, and it's therefore overloaded with coconut aromas, creamy custard and pear flavors, and a taste of banana on the finish. At every point along the way the wood towers over the fruit, which ultimately makes the wine duller than it could be.","designation":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"it","description":"You can almost tell from the look that this is dense and heavy. It has a huge bouquet of wet earth, spice and oak, but not much fruit. In the mouth, it is drying and on the flat side, although still-kicking tannins reach up and grab the palate. The finish is soft and losing life.

Tannins are well managed; the finish light and fruity.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"A faint perfume of pear can be caught on the otherwise dull nose.

In the nose there's almost no fruit at all, but in the mouth, once you cut through the layers of wood and butter, there's some melon, pear and vanilla. But wood overrides that, too.

Flavors are light and the tannins are tough: a grapey, cherry-candy start that finishes with serious toast and tannin. The mid-palate simply isn't there, and can't support the thick, tannic finish.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Hints of spicy cranberry and white pepper suggest Syrah, but lack all of the grape's power. There is a fair amount of unripe leafiness as well.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"Bulky, chunky lemony aromas come with a touch of green hay, or is it alfalfa?

The palate is fresh and forward, but it also smacks down with narrowing, hard tannins.
