Flavors of black cherry and blackberry sing a pretty song, while the finish is racy and firm, and arguably a bit lean.

The challenge is to develop depth and substance.","designation":"Santa Rita's Earth"},{"country":"cl","description":"Inky dark in the glass, with a dense, smoky nose that succeeds in setting up the wine's jacked-up, high-wattage palate. This wine needs more time in bottle to settle down.","designation":"Character"},{"country":"es","description":"Dense and meaty, with cured ham and earthy mineral notes. The rustic, untamed nose draws you in, but once you get inside things calm down. Yes, the palate's saturated, but it stops short of bowling you over. On the finish, cherry and chocolate flavors bring it home. From a Spanish owner/French winemaker duo.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This is a young and likeable Syrah.

The rich, dry tannins and spicy flourish lend it an edge of interest.","designation":"Harmon"},{"country":"es","description":"Angel Lorenzo Cachazo is behind this open, piquant, vibrant white that really pours on the Sauvignon character. The aromas are more to peach and pear, yet the high-voltage palate is all grapefruit and other citrus.

Hold until 2008.","designation":"Duraton"},{"country":"es","description":"Tobacco and mild green aromas take some of the ripeness off the nose, but all in all it's an electric wine with sweet plum, cherry and boysenberry flavors.

Smoothness is definitely what you get here, plus major-league richness and extract.","designation":"Lanzaga"},{"country":"pt","description":"A rare category, Colheita Ports are vintage wines aged in barrel (this was aged for eight years before bottling in 2002).

Does it have an upper price limit? This wine is very dry and ripe, although the fruity, berry  flavors are deeply buried under the tannins.

It's deceptively easy to drink now, but the structure should become more obvious in time. C?rte-Real considers it  one of the best vintages ever made.  Worth cellaring some for 50 years to see how it compares with the '27 and '55.

A terrific wine, this wine shows the best of what Grenache can do.","designation":"Moppa Springs"},{"country":"US","description":"This flagship Rosenblum wine does not disappoint, with its expressive blackcurrant and cassis aromas and flavors. The overlay of toasted oak adds a sweet vanilla edge. Softly textured, with a bright spine of acidity that keeps it fresh.","designation":"CRS Yates Ranch Reserve"},{"country":"au","description":"There are plenty of reasons the winery gives to account for this wine's hefty price: 125+-year-old vines; 70% new French oak; yields of a half-ton per acre; fruit costs about $7,400 (U.S.) per ton, and is all handpicked.

A fascinating study in contrasts.","designation":"Blocks 9 &amp; 21"},{"country":"au","description":"The smooth tannins on this wine are just stupendous; the black plum and white pepper flavors are also excellent, but definitely secondary to the wine's silky texture. Burnt brown sugar comes through on the nose, perhaps an indication of the 50% new French oak treatment.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"A 100% Shiraz, from a vineyard established in 1904 by the Birks family, the same family that established Wendouree. Has toasty, meaty notes on the nose an appropriate preamble to the grilled meat and black plum flavors on the palate. Chalky tannins are top-notch, but need 6C8 years to settle down. 1,000 cases produced, 200 of which come to the U.S.","designation":"The Aberfeldy"},{"country":"au","description":"A hard-to-find wine outside of Rockford's mailing list and tasting room (only about 600 cases produced, and they go quickly), but certainly the standard-bearer as far as sparkling Shiraz goes. The average age of Rockford's nonvintage sparkling is 7 years; though it has 23 grams of residual sugar, it tastes just as I'd always envisioned a good sparking Shiraz would: like the still wine, but cold and with bubbles. Plums and juicy berries on the palate, with grape and violet aromas on the nose. Good luck finding it, but certainly grab it if you do.","designation":"Black"},{"country":"au","description":"A museum release that won't be on the market, probably, until late 2004, but is worth the wait.

Juicy lime and crisp acids show through on the finish.","designation":"Classic Clare"},{"country":"au","description":"Like its younger brother, the Ebenezer, the cassis fruit here is pretty rich but quickly settles down on the palate, with smooth tannins that ride out through the finish.

Amen, sister.","designation":"Cordon Cut"},{"country":"US","description":"This opulent, all-too-drinkable wine offers powerful aromas and flavors of ripe Bosc pears that are liberally oaked.

This year's fine effort is not as big as the magnificent '99, but is opulent and delicious.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Mint, thyme and maybe even some ginger peek through on the nose. It starts off on the palate with sweet fruit that suggests a bold, in-your-face wine, but that it's more elegant than that: It has smooth tannins, mixed plums and a snap of white pepper and rosemary at the finish. This wine (as it always does) shows some serious oak more than other tasters could handle but it's excellent nevertheless.","designation":"The Octavius"},{"country":"US","description":"Big, big, big, in every respect.

It is a fresh, young wine, a bit sharp in its bite, but packed with lime, peach and pear flavors that also possess a flinty, mineral edge. The finish is long, spicy and impressive. As good as it is now, its precocity suggests aging through 2010.","designation":"La Carriere"},{"country":"US","description":"A brilliant and impressive wine whose rich fruit, lush tannins and structure recommend it.

Chewy and rich on the finish, suggesting that although delicious now, it should hold up in the cellar just fine.","designation":"Cask 23"},{"country":"au","description":"Closed on the nose, with traces of mint and black pepper showing through. In the mouth, it's subtle, with juicy black plum flavors and a great, lasting grip on the palate. I could be crazy, but is there a Grand Marnier-esque orange liqueur note on the finish?

As excellent as this wine is, the '99 is even better.","designation":"Hill of Grace"},{"country":"au","description":"A beautiful wine whose plum fruit is juicy and pure.

Shows plenty of class and elegance.","designation":"Estate Bottled Red Wine"},{"country":"it","description":"Smells wonderful, like butter-saut ed mushrooms served over toast, showing nuances of fat and earth. It's medium-weight and creamy in the mouth, with flavors of apples and pears, turning fresh and citrusy on the finish without becoming sharp or angular.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"fr","description":"Light and airy on the bouquet, with lovely rosemary and other green-herb notes. Zippy acids deliver flavors of pear and candied apple right to the precipice of one's palate. And even if it finishes a bit tangy and shrill, it's got great feel and purity.","designation":"Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"Classic North Coast Merlot, polished and sleek, with elegantly soft tannins and flavors of plums, black cherries and chocolate. Extra-ripe grapes lead to a honey-sweet finish, but the wine is technically dry. Perfect with prime rib.","designation":"Miradero"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a blend of 85% Cab Sauvignon, 9% Cab Franc and 9% Merlot, and benefits from the mingling of the three. It is nicely woven together, with supple cassis, berry and mineral streaks, and nice tannins.","designation":"Red Willow"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a winemaker's wine. The underlying fruit flavors are tight, suggesting tart green apples and barely ripened peaches; smoky oak has added buttery, creamy notes. A very good candidate at the dinner table.","designation":"Firepeak Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"What a juicy, tasty Chard this is. It's classic Russian River, with its flavors of tart green apples veering into ripe peach and pear, and that sleek backbone of minerality. Well-oaked with smoky, spicy wood, adding to the complexity. The texture is rich and smooth.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's Bordeaux blend (66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 12% Cab Franc), it's full, seamless and complete, with rich, satiny fruit layered into chocolatey oak. This is almost Napa-like, but with raspberry/cherry fruit that has the acid structure of Washington grapes.","designation":"Grace"},{"country":"US","description":"Textbook Santa Maria Chard, with its rich flavors of mango, papaya and pineapple. The acidity is high, making for a tartness through the finish, but oak softens and adds smoky cream and vanilla and a smooth roundness. Satisfying and pleasant all the way through.","designation":"Nielson Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"From a block within a vineyard, a distinctive wine, with its own style and personality. Flavors span the gamut from blackberries and cassis to tobacco, rhubarb, white pepper, white chocolate and sage, and the tannins are dry, rich and complex. Has a youthful bite of acidity, suggesting short-term aging.","designation":"Hoenselaars Vineyard Upper Block"},{"country":"US","description":"From a cooler site, the Boushey shows more of the roasted, smoky character of Syrah. It's harvested a month later than the Ciel du Cheval Syrah, so it's a rougher, fleshier wine with some alcoholic heat in the finish. But man, what a riot of flavors!","designation":"Boushey Grand Cote"},{"country":"it","description":"A red-carpet bouquet of mint, fresh-baked bread, blackberry and tar is as welcoming as can be. This is top-flight Dolcetto: The mouth overflows with well-matched and balanced plum, berry and earth flavors. Expectedly, the finish is spot on; it flows just right, leaving a slick, but solid, aftertaste. Drink now for top results.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"An excellent Viognier. The tropical fruit, wildflower and spicy flavors are strong and ripe, but they're balanced by bright acids and even some dusty tannins. That makes the wine full-bodied and complex. It's delicious on its own, but will be excellent with pork tenderloin.","designation":"Hoot Owl Vineyards"},{"country":"fr","description":"Dry, almost dusty scents lead into a full, ripe, flavorful blanc de blancs with a lot of rich, round fruit flavors. It's a complete wine, full and quite tasty, with a good balance to the finish that includes toast, caramel, vanilla and enough acid to prop up the big fruit.","designation":"Blanc de Blancs Brut"},{"country":"au","description":"Solid and excellent, as it almost always is. Plum fruit dominates, with anise accents; tannins are smooth. Wood is present but subtle mouthfeel is textured more like clay than oak.","designation":"Balmoral"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a gem, with lots of up-front toast. A typical  structured year for Champagne, this has clean, round fruit, but retains good acid, providing firm support and longer-term aging potential than the '95. It floats into a pleasing, vanilla cream and toast finish.","designation":"R serve Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"A pretty wine, scented with orange and chocolate. Very smooth and elegant, it isn't bogged down with massive fruit or too much alcohol. It's stylish in the French way, yet still powerful with layers of flavors that unwrap like Christmas packages. Superior winemaking. Only 2,000 cases made.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"A very nice wine, fairly full in the mouth, but a little standoffish and closed at this age. Wide minerally aromas are all that showed on the nose, even after an hour of aeration. The butterscotch richness that seems to be Heidsieck's trademark is present here, too, with white peach flavors hiding underneath. Needs 8C10 years at the least; in the next decade, this evaluation may prove conservative. A blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay; only the second vintaged wine of the 1990s.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"A delicious wine that bodes well for the vintage. Filled with flavors of ripe tropical fruits, peaches and pears, vanilla and buttered toast, in a creamy texture perked up with crisp acidity. Finishes with a smoky, spicy aftertaste.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Another fine Cab from this veteran producer. Deep, penetrating flavors of cassis and green olive coat the palate with great persistence. Oak is notable, and the tannins are lush, soft and dry. Made in the Sattui style, which is immediate accessbility, but will no doubt age.","designation":"Preston Vineyard"},{"country":"au","description":"This Cab is serious business, and could not be mistaken for any other variety. It's excellent but curmudgeonly, without any flavors that you'd ever call feminine. Fruit is big and black, ripe but not sweet, with smudges of dirt, as though it took a tumble in a fistfight. Oaky   tannins through and through. May soften in its older age drink after 2007.","designation":"The Menzies"},{"country":"fr","description":"At first blush, the bouquet is rich and impenetrable, but when it opens citrus comes on strong. Chewy apple fruit with some Pinot heft define the palate, while licorice and anise add character to the finish. Plump, round and a pleasure to drink. Very substantive.","designation":"Brut Imp rial Ros "},{"country":"fr","description":"Elegant, distinctive and impeccably crisp, with a spicy bouquet that suggests clove and mint. Stylish, concentrated and tightly focused, this is a classy fizz that extends gracefully through an immaculately clean finish.","designation":"La Fran?aise Brut"},{"country":"fr","description":"The '96 vintage started out tight and even austere, but now it seems to have ripened a bit.

There are some pretty good tannins, and while they're soft, they impact the mouthfeel.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"True to the house style, this is a rich, savory Champagne, with notes of ginger, soy sauce and meat gravy mingling with earth, toast and citrus. Smooth and creamy in the mouth, with an orangey finish.","designation":"Cuv e Sir Winston Churchill Brut"},{"country":"fr","description":"Very crisp and somewhat metallic, with a mineral or iron-ore core. On the palate, it opens up with somewhat rounder fruit flavors of tangerine and citrus, but it retains an austere, tightly delineated structure: Elegant and refined.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"Not as concentrated as the '99, but an impressive wine. The aroma is especially attractive, with white pepper, cassis and grilled meat accented with smoky oak. Similar flavors, especially blackcurrant, and rich, fine tannins. Notable for the long finish. Mainly Syrah, with Grenache and Mourv dre.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Round, yeasty and rich, with apple and lemon flavors that are perfectly bolstered by almond and butterscotch. Once in the mouth you notice some weight and drive. It's a persistent wine, with plenty of body and a solid acidic core.","designation":"Cuv e Orpale Blanc de Blancs"},{"country":"US","description":"EOS's complex Bordeaux blend is a big, sturdy wine with a skeleton of firm tannins that finish with a dry astringency, suggesting cellar time. They frame a generous core of blackberry and black cherry fruit.   Enjoy now with rich foods, or be patient.","designation":"French Connection"},{"country":"US","description":"Refreshing and delicious, a crisp, delicate wine that's not too grassy. Has pleasant lime, apple and vanilla flavors that drink pure and refined. A distinctive, superior Sauvignon Blanc that shows off its terroir.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Not a saign , but made instead by blending in 5C7% red wine, this ros  is Heidsieck's first since 1985. With its beautiful salmon-copper color and dried-cherry aromas, it was worth the wait. Earthy, dusty flavors envelop its sturdy white-cherry frame, which holds on tight through the lingering finish. Still young, and a little closed; will show its best after 2008.","designation":"Brut Ros "},{"country":"US","description":"From Carneros, a dark, young, meaty wine that's almost a meal in a bottle. What you get is a potpourri of cherry, mushroom, meat, sundried tomato, anise and dill, with accents of smoky oak. Drinks long and smooth in the mouth, although there's a little place in the middle palate that's hollow, and tough tannins kick in on the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Full-bodied and tightly wound, this Shiraz probably won't show its best for another 2C3 years. It's a focused, solid wine, with a blackberry and blueberry core and a note of wheat or biscuit. Dry, smooth tannins come on strong in the midpalate and follow through to the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful Cab that cheats the vintage with its plumply ripe fruit. Pours black, and opens with young, fairly closed aromas of herbs and oak, but the hidden depths of this wine reveal themselves in the blackcurrant, cherry and chocolate flavors that last through the finish. Should age through the decade, or try now with prime rib.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Superripe and gooey with tropical fruit. Bursting with mango, pineapple, guava, orange, roasted hazelnut, buttered toast, vanilla and smoke, in a custardy texture that's smooth and refined. Finishes dry, with a lingering flavor of orange and spice.","designation":"Winemaker's Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"Unusually, this wine is made entirely with Pinot Noir (most ros  Champagne has some Chardonnay). The result is a wine with some weight, combined with a light touch of crisp acidity. Poised, balanced fruit and toast flavors make it a fine food wine.","designation":"Brut Ros "},{"country":"US","description":"This is the new section of Paul Champoux's highly respected Washington vineyard. As such, it is not quite as deeply concentrated as the old-vine stuff, but can be expected to age well, developing Bordeaux-like highlight of cedar, earth and mineral as it does. Just 150 cases were made.","designation":"Baby Poux Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A seriously good wine, and it's hard to believe they're practically giving it away. With its depth of blackcurrant, herb and coffee flavors that are long and deep, its rich tannins and near perfect balance, it's impressive from start to finish. A very great value from Chalone Wine Group.","designation":"Four Corners"},{"country":"US","description":"Unusually concentrated and intense for a Monterey Merlot; a big, rich wine that assaults the palate with flavors of blackcurrant, plum, chocolate, dried herbs and smoked oak. The tannins are as smooth and plush as anything up north. Would score higher if not for a certain thinness in the middle palate, but that's a result of the vintage.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Very young and tannic, and not showing its best at the time of tasting. Aromas of spiced plum, dried herbs and oak, and those powerful tannins numb the palate and plaster over the fruit. Try decanting for a few hours, or better yet, drink after 2008.","designation":"Behler Reserve"},{"country":"nz","description":"This impressive effort blends Hawke's Bay and Martinborough fruit to deliver enticing aromas of cracked black pepper, licorice and blackberries. Lushly fruity on the palate, with hints of vanilla adding an elegant note. Has some tannins to lose; try from 2005C2010.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Pretty in the nose, with textbook aromas of lime and gardenia. The palate offers soft, citrusy fruit, with flavors of orange and melon. Totally sleek and correct, with a fine level of natural carbonation and a delicious balancing sweetness.","designation":"Marsillo"},{"country":"it","description":"Sweet and attractive, with everything in its proper place. Dusty red-fruit and gumdrop aromas draw you in, where you come face to face with juicy, plump berry fruit, a tasty, chocolaty finish and a layer or two of complexity. With zest, power and poise, this wine hits the style head-on.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Dark and dense, with tight lemony oak controlling a nose that also features some promising black fruit. Very precise across the palate, with delicious blackberry flavors. Some dark chocolate and berry pie notes carry the forward finish. With multiple layers and blaring class, this is one attractive Piedmontese red.","designation":"Luca Monaca"},{"country":"it","description":"Lavishly oaked, but not overdone, which is really the key. Quite sweet and spicy at first, with raisin aromas . Later come notes of fine-grained wood and toast. The body is round and lush, with cassis and blackberry flavors that give it a Merlot-like personality. Texture-wise, it's firm and solid, with healthy acids and live tannins. Can probably age for another several years.","designation":"Fides"},{"country":"fr","description":"A fine-beaded, rich and toasty wine, with flavors of roasted nuts and vanilla dominating. It tastes like what you would expect of bubbly Chardonnay tart and appley, but with good length and persistence.","designation":"Noble Cuv e Blanc de Blancs"},{"country":"fr","description":"Richly fruity, and with a somewhat aggressive mouthfeel, this wine should mellow admirably in another year or two. For now, it packs buttered pears and toast into a somewhat simple, yet promising, package.","designation":"Cuv e Palmes d'Or Brut"},{"country":"au","description":"The fruit on the palate is the very picture of plum. The wine's not lean, nor is it sweet it's a solid, medium- to full-bodied Cabernet that doesn't try to bowl you over with oak or caramel or, well, anything. It's balanced and well behaved, with aromas that run the gamut from blackberry and plum to mocha to cherry to caramel. Very nice.","designation":"Platinum Label"},{"country":"US","description":"An interesting wine by virtue of its terroir-driven features. Low in cherry fruit, high in earthy tobacco, dry as a bone and tart with acidity. But it has an elegantly sweet edge that cries out for richly sauced pasta and beef.","designation":"Alegria Vineyards Axiom Syrah Cuvee"},{"country":"US","description":"From a single vineyard in a warm part of the valley, a massive wine. It's hard to put into words how fruity it is without using the word  bomb,  but that's not a pejorative in this case. It's huge, but balanced, dry, harmonious, dramatic and very oaky. Drink it now with full-flavored foods.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This wine has a good, dark color, rich aromas of currants and toasty oak, blackberry flavors and fine, dry tannins. It merits a high score because of all these qualities, and yet it would score higher except for a certain absence of depth of flavor. Defines the deficiencies of this vintage.","designation":"Estate Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"From vines planted in 1967, a lush, complex wine, with peach flavors giving way to dried apricot, hazelnut, flowers and herbs, and a suggestion of brittle autumn leaves in the finish. Round, creamy and opulent on the palate, with a smoky, vanilla edge, it's a fascinating wine that shows how good Chard can be with a little bottle age.","designation":"Shop Block Dutton Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"A selection of the best lots of Merlot from Cold Creek, Horse Heaven, Canoe Ridge and Indian Wells. The 2000 lacks the profound depth of the '99, but it is still a very classy wine, with a mix of red and blue fruits, defining acids and smooth tannins. The oak barrels add well-integrated notes of black tea, smoke and spice.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a rarity 100% S millon, showing the woolly, woody side of the grape, with bone-dry styling and nice, creamy hints of bean and vanilla. Complex and suited to shellfish, this is a sleek, textural, very fine effort.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Pure and strapped, with plenty of oak but even more racy blackberry and pepper. The power is on here; cherry, plum skin and currant are wrapped snugly amid tight tannins. Overall it's lean and inspired, and it would be sensational with meat-filled tortelloni.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"For an older wine, this is fresh, lively and isn't even close to folding. In fact, it's coming along perfectly and still requires either sturdy food or another few years on its side. That said, it features a pristine black-fruit nose, delicious berry fruit, and a hard, starching finish with dynamite tannins. It's a touch like nails at the very back end, but like we said, with food it'll be great.","designation":"Carato Venusio"},{"country":"US","description":"Rich, with a tangy range of flavors from tart green apples through pears and peaches and a hint of pineapple. Well-balanced with creamy, smoky oak, bracing acidity and dusty brown spices.

Deep and complex.","designation":"Unfiltered"},{"country":"fr","description":"Bright gold in color, with saffron, butter and toffee aromas. This is an elegant Champagne, with butter even Sherry flavors, and dried apricot fruit on the palate. Finishes a little shorter than we'd like, with mature cheese-rind and dust flavors.

This wine is wonderful now but clearly has the bones to improve in the cellar.","designation":"Two Acres"},{"country":"fr","description":"Spent nine years on lees; starts off with a pastry-crust aroma. The wine's mouthfeel is beautifully textured, neither too coarse nor too foamy. The flavor that manifests itself as butterscotch in the nonvintage brut is, here, like honey and toffee, adding richness to a pear-fruit core. A creamy, full and sexy wine, finishing medium-long. To toast with this wine is reason in and of itself to get married.","designation":"Brut en Magnum"},{"country":"US","description":"Monster Merlot, a wine that kicks butt from first to finish. Pours a deep garnet, and leaves streaky glycerine on the glass. Opening aromas are young and closed, of blackberry, ground coffee and spice.

Very pretty and wall-to-wall in terms of structure. From Antinori's Puglian operation.","designation":"Bocca di Lupo"},{"country":"US","description":"The opening aroma is muted in fruit, dominated by white pepper and a landslide of new oak.

There's a charm and elegance to the wine that belies its considerable complexity and ageability.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Shafer's annual contribution to the Rh?ne gene pool is one incredible Syrah.

Instead, you get cherries, brown sugar and stably flavors in the mouth and some drying, woody tannins on the finish. A tar/resin note persists on the nose.","designation":"Vat 9"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells and tastes pretty good, with currant notes accented by considerable oak, which brings vanilla, smoke and sweet wood-sap flavors. Yet the tannins are enormous and problematic, striking midpalate and leaving the mouth feeling numb, and the depth of flavor just isn't there to counterbalance them.","designation":"Dedication"},{"country":"US","description":"Feels fancy and plush in the mouth, with pretty tannins that are ripe and dusty, and quite a thick slathering of oak. The flavors are on the thin side, suggesting blackberries; really though, it's more herbal and tobaccoey than fruity.","designation":"Lewelling Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"Sweet at first, with aromas of corn, hay and minty alfalfa.

Finishes with dark berries and more eucalyptus. A very good wine, if perhaps an acquired taste.","designation":"Old Winery"},{"country":"au","description":"A very nice Shiraz, with meaty, chocolaty flavors and a core of ripe black plums. The nose also takes on earthy-mushroom and molasses scents; from end to end, oak is present, but not overbearing. A natural match for beef roast and gravy.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"A big bruiser of a brut, with fat bubbles and fat flavors of bubblegum, coconut, tropical fruits and sweet vanilla. In short, a cornucopia of ripe, tropical fruit flavors; big, broad and wonderful.","designation":"Premier Brut"},{"country":"it","description":"Super fresh, snappy, lip-smacking and almost sweet.

Tight and green, it is more like a young blanc de blancs, at least at the moment, with flavors of grapefruit and citrus. Yeasty and still scented with SO2 from bottling, it barely suggests the delicious flavors of roasted nuts and vanilla that may yet develop. Wait and see.","designation":"Grande R serve Brut"},{"country":"fr","description":"Give it time to breathe and lose the sulfurous scents of bottling.

Mango, apricot, peach and cantaloupe flavors mingle, enriched with smoky vanilla and oak, but all this is controlled by firm acids, and the wine is fully dry.","designation":"Block Collection Preston Vineyard"},{"country":"au","description":"This Bordeaux blend isn't austere, exactly, but feels a little Old World. Maybe it's the wine's dryish tannins and modest size, or maybe it's that wines from the cool-climate Adelaide Hills just aren't oversized by definition. It's a very good wine, though, with a base of black plum and some meat and oak aromas on the nose.","designation":"The Fugue"},{"country":"US","description":"Thick and custardy in texture, thanks to barrel aging and lees contact that have imparted a soft plumpness to the wine.

A juicy, generous, spicy wine that ought to be served well-chilled, with noodle dishes and hot stuff.","designation":"Dry"},{"country":"fr","description":"A lightly creamy ros , this wine merely hints at, rather than broadcasts, its component flavors.

At this price, though, it's a minor complaint.","designation":"Big Rivers"},{"country":"US","description":"Oaky and tart, a big wine with strong flavors of citrus fruits, green apples and dusty brown spices. Crisp acidity adds a steeliness that is almost minerally.

The first release is a sharp, melony, oyster-friendly Sauv Blanc, steely and refreshing.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A seductive wine made in the Napa Big Red style, which means ultrasoft, velvety tannins, extracted fruit and a lavish overlay of oak.

This is a well-judged wine that performs beautifully.","designation":"Brut Ros "},{"country":"US","description":"This year's release is young, tight and oaky. Hard to smell much beyond well toasted oak, lees and roasted hazelnut, but there's a suggestion of tropical fruits. In the mouth, the flavor of sweet, smoky oak dominates. Hard to tell where it's going. Give it a few months in the cellar to knit together.","designation":"Cuv e Sauvage"},{"country":"US","description":"An engaging, quaffable style, which sports pretty berry/cherry fruit and a nice peppery middle.

The longer it sits, the more it grows on you.","designation":"Nicholas"},{"country":"fr","description":"Open from the beginning, with aromas of pear and apple.

The flavors are very different from the Somers Ranch Zin, instead offering mint and fresh strawberries layered over a base of chocolate. Quite firm on the finish, this could also be held up to five years.","designation":"Beeson Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"Cold Creek may be the most Bordeaux-like vineyard in the Columbia Valley; it holds tightly to its charms, and slowly opens with time.

Not likely to age well, because the fruity concentration just isn't there.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Meaty and muscular, with a beefy heft that can't be denied.

With pop and power, this one doesn't tread lightly.","designation":"Grand Cuv e Brut Ros "},{"country":"US","description":"A fine Cabernet in the international style. Well-ripened blackcurrant and herb flavors, supersmooth and soft tannins, and a rich but nuanced overlay of smoky oak.

Not a big wine, but balanced and accessible, with interesting, complex, spicy highlights.","designation":"Otis"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a rich Chardonnay brimming with fruity flavors, and it is also very lavishly oaked.

Acidity provides a bracing backbone; one minor quibble is that all the makeup is on the surface.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"This vintage ros  tete de cuv e has a sturdy, tannic edge to it. The color is a bit more robust than the Grand ros , the fruit flavors more firm and hard, but this wine is less open, and feels tight and constrained. The flavors slam against a tannic wall, odd for a Champagne, but for a moment the finish seems to stop in its tracks, with an earthy, gritty texture. Down the road, with a few more years in the bottle, this could be a champ.","designation":"Celebris Brut Ros "},{"country":"US","description":"Most Washington Cab-Merlots are low-end wines, but in this case it is a true reserve, though not labeled as such. Bordeaux-like structure, tight and herbal and young. I suspect it will age very well, as a recent taste of the winery's stellar 1991 Reserve demonstrated. Here the tannins are nicely managed; the hint of oak is just right.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Sure, the packaging probably accounts for much of this wine's cost, but what's under the red leather is pretty good stuff.

Not quite as precisely defined as the Chateau reserve wines, it is a very drinkable blend, good, but somehow less than the sum of its parts.","designation":"Art Series"},{"country":"it","description":"Easy and mildly candied, with sweet aromas offset by lemon peel and green apple.

Slightly creamy in the mouth, turning talc-like and showing some lovely soft tannins on the finish.","designation":"McRae Wood"},{"country":"US","description":"A nice Merlot at a great everyday price. Drinks very dry, with earthy, blackberry flavors that are pretty rich. The tannins are dry and complex. There are many Merlots out there that cost twice as much and aren't as good.

One of NC's best Malbec efforts we've tried.","designation":"Gran Reserva Altos del Rio"},{"country":"US","description":"An exceptionally rich and delicious Chardonnay for the money, and a great value.

Goes beyond the plummy, meaty flavors to include a complex melange of dried herb and floral notes.

In fact, the tannins on this wine are as hard as they come for California Pinot, so it's a tough-edged but tasty ride.","designation":"Jensen Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a pink-hued blanc de noirs made from Cabernet rather than Pinot Noir. It's bright and fresh, with pretty citrus, raspberry, cherry, toast and herb flavors at the fore. Clean and zippy on the finish, it's full and round. Shows that fine bubbly can be made outside its normal varietal parameters.","designation":"Chauvignon Sparkling Ros "},{"country":"US","description":"Pungent and ripe, with whiffs of smoke, herbs, roasted meats and sassafras.

These contribute creamy, smoky and sweet and sour cream nuances to an acidic wine obviously built for food, rather than by-itself hedonism.","designation":"Winery Lake Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Quite a rich Pinot, and not a simple fruit bomb. Plenty of ripely sweet berry flavors accompanied by earthier notes of chocolate and herbs. Delicious on its own, but great with everything from BBQ to high-end dishes.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a big, plummy wine with hints of dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean and grilled meat.

In the mouth, it turns fruity in an elegant way, with a round texture and a long, dry finish.","designation":"Brut Rose"},{"country":"US","description":"Delightfully refreshing, this sparkling wine is dry, yet filled with complex black cherry and bitter almond flavors. Made in an Aussie style, it also serves up pretty licorice, raspberry and herbal accents for added interest. A dark alternative to standard sparkling fare.","designation":"Sparkling"},{"country":"US","description":"A ripe dessert wine, not shockingly sweet but an easy companion for sorbet or a fruit tart. The apricot flavors are wrapped in a honey-thick texture, balanced with firm acids, and the intensity lasts through a long finish.","designation":"Botrytis"},{"country":"US","description":"There's not much Sauv Blanc being made in Oregon these days, which is unfortunate, if this intense, spicy, focused wine is representative of what can be achieved.

This is another big wine from Etude, weighing in at 14.6%, but if you like 'em large, it's your ticket. The mouth oozes black plum and cherry, and the finish is toasty, with creamy chocolate notes.

Jammy cherry-raspberry fruit flavors have overtones of chocolate, spices and white pepper; the tannins are soft and subtle. Lip-smackingly good.","designation":"Eye of the Dragon"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the last of Amity's '99s to be released; no '99 reserve was made because the juice went into three single-vineyard releases. With the extra time the wine has smoothed out a bit, but it is still tight and reticent upon first being opened. Good structure, some spicy highlights, and a concentrated, tarry finish.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"US","description":"A lovely blend of lemony-fresh aromas that introduce well-balanced toasty, bread-like notes.

A real find.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"ar","description":"Bodega Catena Zapata's high-end Malbec deserves credit for its balance and focus on fruit.

Again, those refreshing flavors of tart green apples sprinkled with white pepper, with an edge of grass and herbs. Its angularity suggests but does not demand aging.","designation":"Thomas Road"},{"country":"US","description":"Takes the regular bottling to new heights, as if everything were on steroids.

It's from Patrick Campbell of California, and it comes from 80-year-old vines. The concentration and power are up front, as are the oak and tannin.

Just 300 cases made in conjunction with Achaval-Ferrer.","designation":"Vale La Pena"},{"country":"US","description":"Richer and riper than Sterling's Winery Lake bottling, a wine whose pear flavors veer all the way into mango.

This young, elegant wine will improve with extended cellaring.","designation":"Blanc de Blancs"},{"country":"US","description":"This 5-year-old brut contains a small percentage of even older reserve wine, and it shows in the smooth, mellow texture, which age has softened.

Their reserva is richly extracted, with legs that want to climb up rather than down. The nose is full of mint, leather and blueberry, while the thick palate stays balanced and tight. The fact that oak is complementary and not dominant is the coup de grace.","designation":"Reserva Vi?a Hormigas"},{"country":"US","description":"If size is your thing, here's a Godzilla of a Chard, as you'd expect from Ed Sbragia. The deep gold color suggests the oak level, which is massive in vanilla and buttered toast. But the flamboyant tropical fruit easily handles it. Oily, rich and unctuous through the spicy finish.","designation":"Sbragia Limited Release"},{"country":"US","description":"Whether it's the age of the vines, the unique warm-cool vineyard location, or Rochioli's deft touch, this is always one of the best California Sauvignons.

Compelling now, but with the stuffing and balance to last through the decade.","designation":"Tierra Mar"},{"country":"US","description":"A new wine from Francis Coppola, named after his son Roman and made from Syrah grapes planted in 1996 on the estate.

Small amounts of Petit Verdot and Merlot round it out.","designation":"RC Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Everything about this modern, high-extract, high-alcohol wine is of the moment, which is why the Heirloom name seems questionable.

A primo heavyweight for the new American palate.","designation":"Heirloom"},{"country":"au","description":"Monster stuff thick, black and oozy yet with high-toned red fruit and mint scents that match the intensity of the smoke and toast of new oak.

Although this wine is dry, it drinks as rich as a fruity custard.","designation":"Purisima Mountain Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"The best Syrah of the vintage, a magnificent wine that blows you away through the force of its beauty and sheer voluptuousness. Pours dark and thick, and announces itself with muted but distinguished aromas of cassis, cherry pie, truffle, vanilla and smoke. Only in the mouth can you begin to appreciate the fantastic wealth of flavors. All this richness is reined in by dusty, structured but easy tannins and the oak regimen. For all its size, the wine maintains delicacy and femininity.

A full-bodied expression of great Cabernet.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Sleek and smooth, jam packed with solid fruit redolent of black cherry, plum, chocolate, cassis, coffee, herbs, licorice, spice and cola. Quite complex, elegant, and long on the finish. An excellent wine from a top-notch producer.","designation":"Highwire Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"This wine really grows on you. It starts off with slightly acrid, coarse elements of briar patch and weeds, but it explodes on the palate, turning rich, chocolaty and refined. Deep layers of softly tannic, plum-flavored fruit caress the mouth, leaving a lasting aftertaste.","designation":"Altero"},{"country":"US","description":"Almost indistinguishable from Beringer's Chabot bottling, perhaps a bit more aromatic and softer in tannins. Flavors range from cassis and black cherry through dark chocolate and dill. Drinkable now with rich foods, but will gain in sweetness and complexity with a few years of cellaring.","designation":"St. Helena Home Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Smooth and luscious, with a fragrant nose of bold red fruit, polished oak and earth. The palate comes together with rich cherry and berry fruit, toast, coffee and tannin. The finish is rich, smoky and long, with a delightful texture. Quite the showpiece wine, courtesy of extra-ripe fruit and 18 months in oak.","designation":"Castello di Brolio"},{"country":"it","description":"Penetrating and intense, with reserve-level qualities. The nose is full of bacon, leather and sandalwood in addition to pulsating red fruit. It represents the purest form of ripeness; the nose, the palate, the finish everything is so forward it seems to be dripping juice. More chewy and soft than some of its neighbors, this may be the perfect wine to drink in the near future.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Pours inky black, and smells young and backward. Lots of airing reveals blackberry jam, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and toast. Drinks soft, velvety, luscious and complex. Good berry fruit is supported by firm, dry tannins. Lovely now, and best consumed in the next year or so to capture its vibrant youth.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Odd that this wine costs less than Wellington's Sonoma Valley bottling, because while it shares the same qualities of cassis, smoke and a smooth texture, it's a shade richer and more concentrated. Feels absolutely beautiful as it slides across the palate, all the way through the pleasing aftertaste.","designation":"Mohrhardt Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Mainly from Rutherford, a beautiful wine. Opens with alluring aromas of blackcurrant and cassis and the lilting perfume of new French oak, with its smoky vanillins. In the mouth, supple and polished, long on Cabernet flavor, with rich, sumptuous tannins. The tannins are already melted, making it drinkable now.","designation":"Great Estates"},{"country":"US","description":"Beautiful and soft as an Impressionist painting. Flavors of cherries, black raspberries, spices and herbs are wrapped in rich, easy tannins, coating the palate and finishing ripe but dry. Delicious on its own and immediately drinkable. A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.","designation":"Siena"},{"country":"pt","description":"This dense wine is packed with fruit. The blackberry and anise aromas give an impression of the wine's impressive size that is confirmed on the palate. This seems sweeter than most vintages of Dow's flagship wine, but the extra sugar is balanced by big tannins. This is one single-quinta Port that doesn't seem destined for early drinking. Try in 2015.","designation":"Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Porto"},{"country":"US","description":"As good as Herzog's Special Reserve Cab is, this one is better. It has the same ripely fruity currant and cassis flavors, with fine tannins and a luxurious coating of oak that has been judiciously applied. But it goes the extra mile in finesse and balance, and is simply superb. Right up there with the best, and a considerable success for the vintage.","designation":"Special Edition Warnecke Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A very rich wine that clearly has been hand-picked from the best lots, to judge from the extraordinary quality of the flavors and textures. Cassis, herbs, earth and a note of superripe wild blackberry, sweetened to perfection under the sun. Oak adds judicious nuances of smoke and vanilla. This is one of the best Monterey County Cabernet Sauvignons in recent years.","designation":"Blackjack Pasture"},{"country":"US","description":"Gorgeous, beautiful wine, so strongly delicious on its own that it will be a challenge to pair it with food. A myriad of flavors cascades over the palate: cassis, blackcurrants, black cherries, white chocolate, spiced plums and dried herbs. So rich and decadently ripe, it's almost a dessert wine. The tannins are completely soft and melted.","designation":""},{"country":"pt","description":"Perhaps the best young Churchill's I've tasted, the 2000 blends complexity with structure to create an eminently ageable Port. For fruit lovers, there's crushed berries and plums, but notes of dried spices and earth add depth. Estimated maturity: 2020C2050.","designation":"Vintage Porto"},{"country":"it","description":"Despite a veneer of toasty French oak, this wine shines with complex layers of fruit. Black cherries lead the way, accented by hints of bacon, dried herbs and spices. This is as graceful a medium-weight wine as we've tasted, satiny-smooth and filled with finesse.","designation":"Schidione"},{"country":"it","description":"Rock solid and compact. This wine is true-blue Brunello, meant to be cellared for 10 or more years. Flavors of plum, cherry and currant are pure, and there's far more fruit here than wood. But the tannins are like nails and they get harder and harder with each sip. Yes, it's a top-flight Brunello, but hold, for best results, until 2010.","designation":"Poggio all'Oro Riserva"},{"country":"US","description":"You could blind-taste this and know it's a fancy Napa Cab from the lush tannins. Any ripe wine can hit the blackcurrant, plum and cherry notes, but few can achieve this level of smoothness. Coats the palate like a single-malt Scotch, with luxury and smoothness that carry into the long finish. Delectable now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Big, big Cabernet, with all the attributes of this unreal vintage. Dark in color, with concentrated, rich aromas of cassis and olive and young, unintegrated smoky oak. Fills the mouth with lush flavors of blackberries and herbs, with distinctive Napa tannins that are fine and dusty. Quite young now, it needs a few years to knit together.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot. Massive berry and fruit flavors, accented with natural spices and 100% new French oak, and wrapped in fancy, smooth tannins. The wine feels important on the palate, and flatters it from entry through the long, delicious finish. It's great to see Paso Robles step up to the plate and produce such world-class wine.","designation":"Optimus"},{"country":"it","description":"Very dark, rich and chocolaty and pretty darn oaky, too. But oh, what size and prowess. The nose is pure hickory smoke, leather and black fruit, while the palate overflows with cassis, black plum and pepper. The mouthfeel is silky yet aggressive, with big tannins and pulsating acids. And the coffee and cacao on the finish go on and on.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Luscious and bold, with a round, masculine bouquet of blackberry, bitter chocolate and a whiff of coconut. The palate sports perfect harmony; it's full of cola, cherry, plum and espresso. The finish is tight and right on the money. Lovely stuff from a fine vintage; a wine made in the rich, sweet, modern style. The blend is Sangiovese, Cabernet and Syrah.","designation":"Summus"},{"country":"it","description":"Incredibly pure fruit defines the sturdy, entirely inviting nose. This is one juicy, rock steady wine; the tannic structure is that of a fortress. There's unadulterated fruit at every checkpoint, and it hits like a hammer as it transitions from palate to finish. To drink now would require rich, rich food. It's such a baby; drink not before 2007, if possible.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Expensive, but the equal of the cults. One whiff and you're in heaven, with its gorgeous aromas of cassis and blackcurrants, fine smoky oak and vanilla, and chocolaty mint. The flavors don't disappoint. Hard to describe the density and concentration of fruits and herbs. This is great Cabernet, superb now but an obvious cellar candidate.","designation":"Private Reserve"},{"country":"it","description":"Round and beautifully fragrant, with smoky nuances atop defined, elegant black fruit. What a stud this wine is; the palate is perfectly ripe, with a touch of oaky vanilla supporting first-class red and black fruits. The finish is clean, smooth and pleasant. It's a stellar Super Tuscan, a leader in its field for sure. And it gets better every minute the bottle is open.","designation":"35 Anni"},{"country":"US","description":"From the Hudson Vineyard in Carneros, this is a very dark wine bursting with cr me de cassis, chocolate, mint, smoke, vanilla and toast aromas. The flavors are similarly rich and unctuous, with great weight and a fabulous core of blackberries and spice. For all its size, it never loses its sense of balance and elegance.","designation":"Cuvee d'Honeur"},{"country":"it","description":"Deep and delicious, with an earth-driven nose that conveys quality. Chunky plum pervades the chewy, dark palate, which offers a gorgeous mouthfeel and admirable depth. Only on the finish do you get a slight hint of oak. Overall it's entirely solid and very likable, but as good as it is, it's not quite on the level of the '98 or '99, which were amazing.","designation":"Ornellaia"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the first commercial reserve wine Patrick Campbell has released in more than 20 years of winemaking, and it is indeed something special. Young and dense now, with firm tannins and acidity, and a richly explosive, meaty core of blackcurrant and cassis fruit. Completely authoritative. Campbell is at the top of his game with this marvelous, ageworthy wine. Drinkable now, but best aged through the decade.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"pt","description":"One of the vintage's standouts, the 2000 Quinta do Noval is incredibly rich and intense, with a density that made me think I should reach for a spoon. Chocoate and coffee, prune and date aromas; plum cake flavors. Despite the richness, there is a superb backbone of acidity and ripe tannins that suggests peak maturity is probably two decades or more away.","designation":"Vintage"},{"country":"US","description":"In a word, massive, a masterpiece of Napa Cabernet from a great vintage. A barrel selection from three vineyards, and a mere 275 cases produced. This wine pours dark and thick, and announces itself with smoky oak aromas riding over cassis. The flavors are rich in blackberries and herbs, framed in rich, thick, dusty tannins. As good as it is, it would be a shame to drink it now. Best after 2004, and for many years afterward.","designation":"Vineyard Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"So good, it makes you want to shout. Possesses the beautifully ripe flavors that are expected of a great vintage, such as blackcurrant, cherry, white chocolate and cassis, with extra edges of smoky caramel and vanilla. The tannins are perfect, soft and easy, but as rich and complex as a Renoir. Differentiates itself from Napa with its softness and accessibility, but as great as anything from across the Mayacamas.","designation":"Scion"},{"country":"pt","description":"A prodigious effort from a small house that's becoming one of the Douro's best. The fruit is massive; huge and inky and filled with blackberries and chocolate. Yet for all its size, it finishes with finesse-filled layers of flavor that fold in mint and black pepper notes.","designation":"Vintage Port"},{"country":"US","description":"Admirably toasty, but seems a bit soft and unfocused on the palate, with modest flavors of mushroom and earth.","designation":"Fort Clatsop Cuvee Blanc de Blancs"},{"country":"US","description":"This hard, tart and bitter wine does not seem to have much of anything in common with the varietal flavors of most Gew rztraminers.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Chunky and full up front, but with grassy, green aromas.

Decent in the mouth, as it gets a bit better with airing.","designation":"Selecion Especial - Estate Bottled"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells a bit musty, although there's an undercurrent of fresh peaches.

Marginally better in the mouth, with berry and herb flavors and sturdy, tough tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"ar","description":"Rusty in color, especially for the normally dark Malbec. Some mint and licorice aromas lead it off, followed by malty oak.

Some lemon-lime on the finish makes it a lot like a liquid lollipop.","designation":""},{"country":"ar","description":"This is meant to be a special selection from the Tulum Valley, but it's rather thick, tarry and candied. A sugary palate the consistency of berry syrup is the vehicle for this oaky, black-fruit heavyweight that is sweet beyond what it should be.","designation":"Don Santiago"},{"country":"US","description":"Rough around the edges, with dull flavors and an overly sweet finish. Sure, the price is right, but you can do better.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The Wahluke slope, where these grapes are grown, is an up-and-coming growing region in Washington state.

Big, chunky and concentrated, with plum, coffee, chocolate and blackberry flavors and rich but softly modern tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a tasty, semisweet, single-vineyard Riesling that does a good job of emulating the German style. The nose features ripe green melon, white pepper and petrol, while the palate turns fruity and racy, much like lemon-lime soda with a twist. The finish is light, zippy and rewardingly sweet. This wine has a good pulse, although you still wouldn't call it electric.","designation":"Roza Hills Vineyard Late Harvest"},{"country":"cl","description":"A rich, well-made middleweight with exotic aromas of citrus peel, leather and toasted wood sitting atop ripe, luscious fruit. More elegant than many, with cocoa and coffee coming on late. Doesn't have the depth of the very best in the field, but what's on display is admirable.","designation":"Special Selection"},{"country":"US","description":"Jammy and easy, showcasing Carneros's tutti-fruity flavors and crisp acids, with pretty cherry and raspberry flavors.

It is very dark and lavishly oaked, aged in 100% new French barrels. The immediate aroma is of vanilla and toast, while the palate experience is of oak and dry tannins that numb the palate through the finish.

This stellar Chardonnay comes from limestone soils in the very south of Beaujolais and the cuv e imported into the U.S. is made entirely in stainless steel.

Pure Chardonnay flavors, with intense concentration, crisp acidity and a long, lingering finish.","designation":"Terres Dorees"},{"country":"US","description":"A cedary, spicy blend of flavors redolent of bright cherry, plum, blackberry, cocoa and coffee.

And the finish is tart and piercing.","designation":"Palet d'or"},{"country":"fr","description":"Fat and pumped up, with raw berry fruit that's rough and ready. Black plum and cherry flavors seem to pick up some mint character, and there's coffee on the finish. There's also some fierce, grippy tannins that grab and don't let go. And for that, it takes a large step backward. A kosher offering.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"nz","description":"This normally reliable winery has turned out a thin, tartly acidic effort this vintage, with cranberry fruit backed by leathery spice. What happened?","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Lots of oak on the nose, and for that matter, throughout. The wine tastes of lemon, vanilla and wood resin, while the creamy finish deals even more oak. Texture and richness are not a problem, but the wood runs roughshod over the mild, base-level fruit.","designation":"Cuv e Prestige Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"The nose is a bit smoky, with nuances of pepper and pine needles. A shock of oak forges through the center of the palate, and it wrestles with the light, fading berry flavors. The body and feel seem right, but there's a lack of purity and power that holds it back.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"Herbal, bordering on vegetal, yet rich and viscous in the mouth thanks to high alcohol and a dash of residual sugar.","designation":"Golden Mile"},{"country":"fr","description":"Herbal, foresty aromas are followed by a palate that delivers strawberry fruit and some light oak. Not a prime-time wine due to a biting lean finish and thin mouthfeel. Lots of red fruit throughout, but also drying tannins.","designation":"Rouge"},{"country":"za","description":"Sweet and sour fruit, not unlike stewed rhubarb, colors the nose and palate. Although it is a little watery, peppery tannins pick up the slack. Closes with eucalyptus, char and bitter herbs.","designation":"Basket Pressed"},{"country":"za","description":"Grassy aromas meet those of papaya and banana, while the palate displays similar tropical notes with citrus and grassiness. Light and thin throughout, this finishes with bitter herbs.","designation":""},{"country":"za","description":"This wine's toast, thyme and amber maple syrup notes are a little mute to start, but gain on the palate with a little yellow fruit peeking through. Light and clean throughout, this is a natural for cocktail hour.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"Much like here in the States,  Reserve  tends to mean oaked to within an inch of its life. This wine shows little more than toasty oak and sweet vanilla flavors, with a flourish of buttered popcorn on the finish. Some peach aromas testify to the fruit's promise, if you enjoy heavily oaked Chardonnay, you may like this one more than the rating suggests.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"za","description":"The colorless appearance of this wine extends to its very delicate and dilute style. Marshmallow, mango, coconut water and orange blossom carry to the palate, with a hint of licorice and grassiness on the finish.","designation":""}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},V={class:"card-container"};function F(s,t,i,c,u,a){const y=p("PoemCard");return n(),r(h,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",V,[(n(!0),r(h,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(o,f)=>(n(),m(y,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...o)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...o))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=l(I,[["render",F]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"wine/39.md","filePath":"wine/39.md"}'),z={name:"wine/39.md"},L=Object.assign(z,{setup(s){return(t,i)=>(n(),r("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
