Drink nowC2016.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Merlot, all sourced from the estate's DuBrul vineyard. It's drinking quite well, though clearly heading into secondary fruit flavors that reflect its ongoing maturation. Cherries, plums and cassis fruits mingle, along with silky, polished tannins. Though it can be cellared indefinitely, it may be at its most delicious drinking peak currently.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Ethereally light with delicate red cherry flavor, this Pinot is soft, complex and interesting, with a racy herbal streak lurking in the background.

Only 100 cases made, with 50 imported into the U.S.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"So rich, ripe and succulent, you can hardly keep from drinking it now. But don't. This is one for the cellar. The alcohol is a refreshingly balanced.

Should begin to peak around 2016 and drink well for another decade.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Amfora's copper-ornage color is completely unique in the wide world of contemporary wine. There's a luminous brightness to the wine's appearance that defies its many years of age. Matured in clay amphorae, this pure expression of Ribolla Gialla delivers a softer approach than Gravner's Breg (a white blend) and amazingly intense aromas of resin, pine nut, caramel, graham cracker and candied fruit.

Yet there are all sorts of earthy, mushroomy, oaky complexities. Gorgeous now, and will hold for at least six years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"An absolutely delicious Cabernet, with ripe blackberry, black currant, milk chocolate and spicy oak flavors.
