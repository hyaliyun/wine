Generously sprinkle the filets all over with salt and pepper, including on the sides. Add the oil to the pan. When the oil is nearly smoking, add the filets and cook for 1 minute. Add a third of the butter and cook for about 3 minutes. Flip the filets and cook another 3 minutes or so for medium-rare, occasionally spooning melted butter over the top. Using tongs, brown each filet on its side, then transfer to a cutting board to rest. Meanwhile, heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Immediately add the remaining butter and the eggs; cook undisturbed just until the eggs begin to set at the edges, about 40 seconds. Then begin to stir the eggs gently to form large curds. Continue cooking until the eggs are just barely set, with some large curds surrounded by a bit of liquid egg, 45 to 60 seconds. Season with salt. Drop pieces of goat cheese and spoonfuls of romesco sauce over the top and sprinkle with parsley. Stir quickly just to marble in the romesco; the eggs should still be very softly set. Remove from the heat. Working quickly, remove the strings and slice each filet into 3 pieces; arrange on 4 plates. Spoon some eggs next to the meat, and top with a drizzle of olive oil and some more parsley. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 39334,&quot;Spice-Rubbed Steak Salad with Creamy Red Wine Vinaigrette One 1 1/2- to 2-pound skirt steak 4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 4 teaspoons sugar<br> 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 1/2 Vidalia or sweet onion, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch rings<br> 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more if needed 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 heads iceberg lettuce, cut into bite-size pieces 2 ounces blue cheese, crumbled into chunks<br> 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved<br> Instructions: For the steak: Place the steak on a large plate.

Whisk to combine, then whisk in the brown sugar. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the warm cocoa mixture. In another bowl, whisk the buttermilk, egg and vanilla; stir into the batter until just combined but don&#39;t overmix. Divide the batter among the prepared cups, filling each three-quarters of the way. Bake until the cupcakes spring back when touched, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the pan 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

For the chicken: Stir together the ginger-garlic paste, paprika, garam masala, turmeric, dried fenugreek leaves, lime juice, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken and, using your hands (I use a glove!), massage well into the chicken. Drizzle with enough oil to gently coat the chicken and massage again. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. At this point, you could refrigerate the chicken overnight to marinate. If you don&#39;t have time for that, let it sit for 20 minutes at room temperature. Place the chicken in a 14-inch cast-iron pan and slide into the oven under the broiler, if using a regular oven. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken reads 155 degrees F, about 15 minutes. Turn the broiler on and cook until the top of the chicken is gently charred, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes in the pan, then slice thinly. Set aside in a bowl, pour the pan juice over it and keep warm. For the salad: Add the fennel, fennel fronds, onions, lime juice and a hefty pinch of salt and toss to combine. Set aside to marinate for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the cilantro and a sprinkle of chaat masala if desired. Taste for seasoning and set aside. For the eggs: Set a medium nonstick pan over medium heat. Beat the eggs well, with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside. Pull the paratha right out of the freezer and flop onto the pan. Cook on one side until gently browned, then flip and cook on the other side to the same level. Remove from the pan. Now pour about an egg&#39;s worth of egg mixture into the pan and immediately place the cooked paratha on top, twirling the paratha so the egg coats the surface. Cook until the egg is cooked through. Remove from the pan. To assemble, place a small handful of chicken down the middle of the egg-coated paratha. Perch some salad on top and sprinkle with another pinch of chaat masala if desired. Roll and serve immediately. Combine the garlic, ginger, oil and vinegar in a food processor bowl and process until smooth. Store in fridge for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 39337,&quot;Oyster and Rockfish Pot Pie 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/2 cup button mushrooms, quartered 1/2 cup medium-diced potatoes 1/4 cup medium-diced carrots 1/4 cup medium-diced leeks 3 stalks celery, medium diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 small onion, medium diced 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup white wine 3 cups fish stock 1 cup heavy cream 1 pound rockfish, skinned and cut into 1-inch cubes 2 dozen oysters, shucked 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 lemon, juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 large puff pastry rounds, chilled (1/8-inch thick and 4 inches round) 1 egg, beaten Instructions: Preheat the oven to 395 degrees F.

Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium saucepan, pushing it through with a rubber spatula. Rinse the sieve. Whisk the sugar, cornstarch, grapefruit zest and salt into the raspberry puree. Whisk in the egg yolks. Cook the mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it?s thick like pudding, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter a few pieces at a time until incorporated. Strain the mixture through the sieve into a small bowl, pushing it through with a rubber spatula. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours and up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 39347,&quot;Chocolate Easter Bowls 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped Coconut Easter Grass, recipe follows Easter egg candies, for decorating 2 cups sweetened shredded coconut 1 to 2 teaspoons liquid green food coloring 1/2 to 1 teaspoon liquid yellow food coloring Instructions: Cut out eight 8-inch circles of parchment paper. Line a baking sheet with the circles. Blow up 8 small balloons. Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Place the chocolate in a heat-safe bowl over the simmering water and stir until the chocolate is melted. Remove the bowl from the heat and let the chocolate cool slightly. Dip a balloon into the chocolate so it covers the bottom and reaches 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the sides. Immediately place the balloon chocolate-side down onto one of the parchment circles. Repeat with the remaining balloons and chocolate. Let cool completely to set up, at least 1 hour. Pop the balloons with a pin and gently peel away any balloon pieces that adhere to the chocolate. Fill the chocolate bowls with the Coconut Easter Grass and decorate with Easter egg candies. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a mesh rack on top, if available. Put the coconut in a shallow bowl. While tossing with a large spoon, add the green and yellow food coloring drop by drop until the desired color is reached. A little more green than yellow makes a pretty grass color. Add a few tablespoons water to moisten the mixture and help disperse the color evenly. If the color is too dark, add additional water, as needed, to dilute to the desired color. Drain the coconut in a sieve or strainer. Spread the coconut in an even layer on the rack, or directly on the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven until dry, 10 to 15 minutes. The coconut grass can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Note: Food coloring can be messy and stain your skin. To prevent this, wear latex gloves. You can also tint the coconut in a large resealable plastic bag, shaking it to color the coconut evenly. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 39348,&quot;Neely&#39;s Chickpea, Ham and Swiss Chard Soup 3 slices bacon, chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 4 garlic cloves, chopped 1 large carrot, diced One 6-ounce piece smoked ham steak, diced into 1/4-inch cubes 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 small bunch Swiss chard, stemmed and sliced into thin ribbons 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth One 16-ounce can chickpeas or black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed One 15-ounce can diced tomatoes Hot sauce, as needed Worcestershire sauce, as needed Grated Parmesan, for garnish Instructions: Add the bacon to a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat.

Pay attention to the consistency. You may have to add more water, as the water content in the ingredients may vary. Strain and chill. Make the Lobster and Dressing: Fill a large pot with water and add plenty of salt. Bring to a boil and add lobsters. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from water, drain and chill. Once the lobsters are cool, take off the head and remove the coral and liquid. Pass the coral through a chinois or fine-mesh sieve. Set aside the resulting liquid for use in the dressing. Peel the lobster tails and cut each tail into 6 medallions. Carefully crack the claws and remove the meat. The idea here is to keep the claw meat whole. Split the claw meat in half lengthwise. Refrigerate the lobster meat until needed. In a bowl, whisk together the reserved coral, vinegar, and oil until smooth and blended. Season with salt, to taste. Set aside. Make the Garnish: Cut the ends off the tomatoes. Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise. Peel back the skin and flesh to expose the seeds. Remove the seeds, taking care to keep the mass of seeds whole. The point here is to remove the tomato seeds and their surrounding gel intact. Set aside. (Reserve the tomato flesh for another use.) Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise and remove seeds. Sprinkle the cucumber generously with salt and let sit for an hour, in a colander in the sink. (The salt will cause the cucumber to release water.) Rinse the cucumber and pat dry with paper towels. Cut the cucumber into a tiny dice. In a bowl, combine the cucumber, peppers, and shallot. Set aside. Pour the oil for frying into a large saucepan to a depth of 2 inches. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil reads 375 degrees F. Fry the bread cubes until golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the croutons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. To Serve: Pour the chilled gazpacho into a pitcher. In the center of each bowl, place 2 medallions and 1 claw half of lobster, and 1 tomato seed \\filet.\\ Arrange the some of cucumber mixture around the edge of the bowl, sprinkle with chives, and top with 4 croutons. Drizzle the dressing around the lobster, and drizzle the lobster with some of the extra-virgin olive oil. Finally, sprinkle everything lightly with the fleur de sel. At the table, set the bowls in front of your guests and pour some of the gazpacho into each. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 39352,&quot;Roasted Asparagus with Prosciutto, Pine Nuts and Shaved Parmesan 24 medium-thick asparagus spears (about 2 pounds), trimmed and peeled 5 slices prosciutto, cut into 1/4-inch strips<br> 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan 1/4 cup pine nuts<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the asparagus, prosciutto, Parmesan and pine nuts in a large baking dish or on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper (light on the salt, as prosciutto and Parm are salty). Toss together all the ingredients to evenly incorporate.

Working in batches, brown the beef strips on all sides. Remove from the pan. In the same pan, fry the onions until soft, about 15 minutes, then add the garlic for 1 minute. Remove. (Check if there is fat in the pan. If not, add a good tablespoon of butter and let it melt.) Add the flour and sugar to the pan and cook for 1 minute to make a roux. Gradually whisk in the stock and bring to a boil. (At this point, turn the oven on to 325 degrees F/160 degrees C.) Add the beer and vinegar to the boiling stock, and bring back to a boil, cooking until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a large casserole dish, layer the onions alternately with the beef strips, seasoning each layer as you go with salt and pepper. Tuck in the bouquet garni and pour the sauce over. Cover and bake for 2 1/2 hours. If you can wait a day before eating, cool the dish completely when it&#39;s out of the oven and refrigerate overnight: the flavor will be even better when you reheat it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]</p><p>&quot; 39354,&quot;Tropical Skies 12 ice cubes 3 oz. chilled green tea 1 cup chilled pomegranate juice 3 oz. gin 1 Tbs. amaretto blueberries and mini-marshmallows, for garnish Instructions: Put four of the ice cubes, the green tea, pomegranate juice, gin and amaretto into a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously for one minute.

Put them in the freezer to firm up, at least 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the cookie dough: Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the brown sugar, butter and granulated sugar until nice and combined, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg and beat until smooth, scraping the bowl if necessary to make sure everything is incorporated. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, coffee granules, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the mixer gradually, mixing on low until totally incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chunks. Scoop the cookie dough into eighteen 2-tablespoon portions and with your palm, flatten each scoop into a disc. Place one peanut butter round in the center of a dough disc. Bring the edges of the dough around the peanut butter round and enclose completely. Roll to ensure all the peanut butter is covered. Flatten with your palm, creating a disc shape once again. Repeat with the remaining peanut butter rounds and dough discs. Split the finished discs between the 2 lined baking sheets. Bake until the cookies are golden brown, 10 to 11 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and allow them to cool slightly before eating, 5 to 7 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 39360,&quot;Harvest Foccacia 1-ounce fresh yeast or 2 envelopes active dry yeast 2 cups whole milk, lukewarm 1 tablespoon sugar, plus 1 teaspoon 5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1/3 cup, plus more for drizzling 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1 cup red grapes, halved or quartered 1 cup golden raisins 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon lemon zest, grated Gray salt 1 egg, beaten well Instructions: In a large bowl or the work bowl of an electric mixer, dissolve the yeast in the milk and add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 cup of the flour. Mix well, cover bowl with tea towel and let stand in a warm place about 15 minutes for the yeast to activate. Place risen dough in mixer, set aside. Take a large saute pan and heat it dry over medium-high heat. Pour in 1 cup of the olive oil and add rosemary. Add grapes, and raisins, mix together and allow to cool. Begin to mix the dough, slowly, and mix another 4 cups of flour in to the yeast mixture with the dough hook attachment, then add a pinch of gray salt. Add half of the olive oil/grape mixture into dough. Knead until smooth with hands. Form the dough into a ball. Place some olive oil in large bowl to coat the sides. Place dough ball into bowl, and cover with tea towel. Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in refrigerator until doubled in bulk about 45 minutes, or up to overnight for a fuller rise. The next day, take the risen dough, and place in mixing bowl. With more olive oil from the grape/raisin mixture, press dough down into a flat disk with the heel of your hand. Using your fingertips, nudge the dough into a rectangle. The dough can be rolled but the pressure will produce heavier bread. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and brush with the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil. Cover with tea towel, and let rise again until doubled, 30 to 40 minutes.

Combine 2 tablespoons salt, 4 tablespoons coarsely ground pepper and 2 teaspoons paprika in a small bowl. Rub each rack of ribs all over with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle evenly with the salt and spice mixture on both sides. Transfer the ribs, meat-side up, to the grill grates. Cover the grill and cook for 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine 1/3 cup cider vinegar with 1/3 cup water in a spray bottle. After 1 hour spray the ribs with the vinegar-water mixture so they are damp all over. Cover and cook for 1 more hour. Meanwhile, combine the ketchup, 3/4 cup water, the remaining 1/3 cup cider vinegar, white vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, hot sauce and the remaining 2 teaspoons paprika in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is warmed through and the sugar is melted, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Check the ribs and spray them again with vinegar-water. They should be starting to take on a red color from the smoke. Cover and cook until they are deep red, 30 to 45 minutes. Spray the ribs once more, then brush the meaty part of each rack with 1/4 cup of the sauce. Close the grill and cook for another 15 minutes so the sauce can set. Lay down two pieces of heavy-duty foil that are long enough to enclose each rack on a work surface and spread half of each sheet with 1/4 cup sauce. Transfer the rib racks, meat side down, onto the saucy part of the foil. Coat the bone sides with 1/4 cup sauce and a few sprays of the vinegar-water, then fold the foil over and seal tightly. Add another layer of foil if the first has punctured during wrapping. Transfer the ribs to a rimmed baking sheet and place on the grill (the baking sheet will catch any juices that leak out). Cover and cook until tender but not falling off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove from the grill and let rest 5 minutes before carefully unwrapping (watch out for hot steam). Slice each rack into individual rib portions and serve with the remaining sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 39387,&quot;Mom&#39;s Meatloaf 2 teaspoons butter 3/4 pound ground beef 1/4 pound ground pork 1 cup minced onions 1/2 cup minced green peppers 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 eggs 1/2 cup heavy cream 3/4 to 1 cup bread crumbs Salt and fresh ground black pepper 2 cups veal stock 2 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

(You can also mash these ingredients together with a mortar and pestle.)<br> Using a sharp knife, butterfly the pork butt, so it opens up like a book. (You can also have your butcher do this for you.) Rub the inside cut of the meat with the paste. Using kitchen twine, tie the butterflied pork back together to make a compact shape.<br> Place the halved garlic heads and potatoes, cut-sides down, on the bottom of a roasting pan to create a bed for the pork butt so it doesn&#39;t sit directly on the surface of the pan. Place the pork fat-side up on the bed of garlic and potatoes, drizzle lightly with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.<br> Place the pan in the oven and bake for 5 hours, or until the skin is browned and the meat is extremely tender; pour the wine over the pork after the first 30 minutes of roasting and baste the meat with the collected pan juices every 40 minutes.<br> Remove from the oven and let rest for 20 minutes.

To parboil and pan-roast these potatoes: In a pot, combine the whole potatoes with water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the pot and set them aside to cool. Cut the potatoes into 3/4-inch chunks and add to a large nonstick skillet with the carrots, garlic, rosemary, and sage. Dress with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and heat on high until the potatoes are crisp and golden, occasionally moving the potatoes by shaking the pan handle. Avoid stirring with a spoon or spatula, so that you don&#39;t break the skin, and the potatoes can achieve a nice sear. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 39422,&quot;Buffalo Bourguignon with Duck Fat-Poached Red Potatoes 3 pounds lean buffalo stew meat, cut into 2-inch cubes 5 cups red wine 5 sprigs fresh thyme 4 sprigs fresh parsley 1 bay leaf 2 black peppercorns 8 ounces bacon<br> 5 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons flour<br> 1 onion, sliced<br> 1 shallot, chopped Salt and pepper<br> 3 1/2 cups beef stock, plus more if necessary<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 3 cloves garlic, 2 cloves minced and 1 clove smashed<br> 20 peeled red potatoes<br> 3 cups duck fat<br> 20 pearl onions<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered<br> 1 pinch of salt<br> Instructions: Marinate the buffalo shoulder meat in a large bowl with 2 cups of the red wine overnight.

Add the breadcrumbs, granulated garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toast the breadcrumbs, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside. Fill a large pot with water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and season generously with salt. Add the spaghetti and cook to al dente, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large saute pan or skillet, add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil along with the garlic and red pepper flakes. Turn the heat on low and let cook until fragrant, for a few minutes. Stir in the wine and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the clams, then turn up the heat to medium and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Use tongs to take the pasta out of the water directly into the pan (this works best when the pasta is a couple minutes away from being done; you want it really al dente so it finishes cooking in the sauce). Use tongs to toss. If dry, add a little pasta water. Add the parsley. Toss until coated in the sauce and the pasta is tender. Serve with the toasted breadcrumbs sprinkled on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39432,&quot;Healthy Slow Cooker Chicken and Rice Soup 5 stalks celery, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick chunks 3 large carrots, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick chunks 2 large sprigs dill, plus 1/4 cup chopped dill fronds and whole fronds, for serving 2 large sprigs thyme 1 bay leaf 1/4 small onion, peeled and root end intact Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 thighs) 8 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 cups cooked brown rice 1 to 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice Instructions: Toss the carrots and celery together in a slow cooker.

In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, or in a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and warm water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes. If you&#39;re using a mixer, turn the mixer on low, add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and let it go until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 5 minutes. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you&#39;re making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water, if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep the sausages from sticking. Grill the sausages until cooked through, turning with tongs. Set aside. Keep the grill hot to make the pizza. Roll or pat the dough into a rustic, oblong shape, about 1/4-inch thick - do this directly on a lightly floured pizza paddle for ease. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and lay oil side down onto the hot grill. Once the dough looks set, in about 2 minutes, turn the crust over. Now prepare the topping. Cut up the tomatoes and add to a large mixing bowl. Add the garlic and basil. Crumble in the sausage. Rip the mozzarella into pieces with your hands and add that too along with some extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, add the salad mix and toss to combine. Once the crust is set and cooked, transfer it to a platter. Scoop up the salad mix in your hands and spread it evenly over the top. Sprinkle with a good dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 39448,&quot;Suissesse Cocktail 1/4 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons absinthe<br> 1 tablespoon orgeat, almond or simple syrup 1 large egg white<br> Dash orange flower water, optional Instructions: Add the cream, absinthe, orgeat, egg white and orange flower water, if using, to a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously for about 15 seconds.

Meanwhile, whisk the sugar, hot chocolate mix, cornstarch and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup milk. Slowly add half of the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking constantly until smooth. Gradually whisk the egg-milk mixture into the remaining hot milk in the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened to a pudding-like consistency, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Let the pudding cool slightly, stirring a few times to prevent a skin from forming. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding and refrigerate until it has completely cooled and thickened, about 4 hours. Before serving, whisk the pudding vigorously until it&#39;s smooth and creamy.

Add tomatoes, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring for 5 minutes more, until most of the liquid in the pan evaporates and the mixture is thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In the skillet heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over moderately high heat until hot. Add the chicken and cook it, turning. Add sausages and cook until lightly browned. Transfer to a plate and deglaze pan with 1/2 cup dry white wine. About a 30 minutes before you plan to serve the paella, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a 14-inch paella pan or shallow casserole at least 14-inches in diameter, combine the sofrito, rice, and the saffron. Pour in 5 cups simmering stock and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil over high heat. Remove the pan from the heat immediately and season with salt. Arrange the chicken, sausage, shrimp, clams, and mussels on top of the rice. Set the pan on the floor of the oven or the lowest shelf and bake uncovered for 20 minutes. Scatter the peas at random over the whole and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more or until all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice and the grains are tender but not too soft. If necessary, add the remaining cup stock, if the rice needs to be more soft. Do not stir the paella once it goes in oven. Let paella stand at room temperature covered with a cloth for 5 minutes before serving.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, Strawberry Jam and lemon zest. Fold in the blueberries. Place the mixture into a re-sealable bag. When you are ready to stuff the bread you will snip off a corner of the bag and pipe the filling in. In a baking dish, whisk together the milk, 1 tablespoon melted butter, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and eggs. In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet melt the 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Using the re-sealable bag as a pastry bag, stuff each slice of bread with about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture. Once the slices are stuffed, place each slice into the milk and egg mixture for about 10 seconds per side. Once the slices are coated with the custard base, place them into the skillet to brown. Work in batches. Cook each slice of stuffed French toast until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. If cooking a large batch, transfer the cooked French toast to a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven while you cook the rest of the slices. Repeat the process with the remaining French toast. Serve warm, topped with extra berries, powdered sugar and maple syrup. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the strawberries, sugar and lemon juice to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and stir often until the fruit thickens and becomes syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes. Fill a large bowl with ice and a little water. Have a smaller mixing bowl that can sit within the larger bowl of ice. Once the fruit has cooked, add it to the smaller bowl and set it in the ice bath to cool. As the fruit cools it should become gel-like.

Coat four 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. (If you don&#39;t have 4 pans, make 1 box of cake mix at a time and use half of the food coloring in each batch.) Prepare the cake batter according to the package directions. Divide the batter among 3 bowls. Add the green food coloring to one, the pink to the next and the yellow to the last. Create a tie-dye pattern by randomly adding a quarter-cup scoop of different color batters to the pans, dividing the batters among the 4 prepared pans. Use a toothpick to swirl the colors.

Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Fit a large pastry bag with a medium piping tip. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, combine the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt. Whisk the whites on medium-high until they start to turn white. Very slowly add in the sugar. Whip the egg whites on high for another 4 to 5 minutes until glossy and stiff peaks form. Transfer to the prepared pastry bag. Pipe the meringue on the lined sheet trays into bone shapes varying in size from 3- to 5-inches-long. You should get about 40 to 50 bones. Place in the oven and bake for 3 to 4 hours or until completely dried and cooked through. You can break one in half to determine if they are dry all the way through and done. Remove from the oven and let cool. Store in an airtight container until ready to use. For the Cakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 6-inch and 10-inch cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Prepare one box cake mix according to package instructions. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans, filling them about halfway up the sides. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 28 minutes. Let cool in pan for 20 minutes then remove and let cool on cooling rack. Repeat the process with the remaining boxes of cake batter so you have three 6-inch cakes and three 10-inch cakes. For Raspberry Blood Sauce: In a medium saucepan combine the raspberries, corn syrup and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer for 6 to 8 minutes. Strain the cooked raspberries through a fine mesh strainer, making sure to press the raspberry pulp to extract as much of the raspberry liquid as possible. Discard the seeds. Let the sauce cool. Once cooled, the raspberry sauce should have the consistency of pancake batter. Whisk in the chocolate syrup to give it a slight darker color to make it resemble blood. Transfer to a resealable container and keep in the refrigerator until ready to use. For Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the cream cheese on medium until smooth and fluffy. Add the butter and continue to beat until light and fluffy, another 2 minutes. Add the sugar, one cup at a time. Add vanilla and salt and mix for another 15 seconds. The frosting is easiest to work with at room temperature. If you are not using it right away, transfer it to a reusable container and store in the refrigerator. When ready to use, let it sit on the counter for about an hour and then mix it up again in the stand mixer at medium-high speed until light and fluffy. To Decorate: Using a long serrated knife, slice the domed top off of each cake layer. Place one of the 6-inch cakes onto a 6-inch cardboard cake round. Using an offset spatula, spread some frosting on top of the cake and place the second 6-inch cake on top. Using a 3- to 3 12-inch round straight-sided drinking glass or round cutter cut out a circle from the center of the 2 stacked cakes and remove the inner cut layers. Crumb coat the cake by frosting it with a thin layer of frosting on all sides and inside the cut out well in the center. Use a little extra frosting inside the well to make sure it is completely coated and sealed. This is where you will add the raspberry blood sauce so it needs to be \\watertight\\u201d. Place the cake in the freezer for about 15 minutes to allow the frosting to harden. Place a 10-inch cake on a 10-inch cardboard cake round. Spread some frosting on top and place the second 10-inch cake on top and spread the top with frosting. Place the third cake, cut side down, on top of the second cake to form three layers. Crumb coat the cake by frosting it with a thin layer of frosting on all sides. Place the cake in the freezer for 15 minute to allow the frosting to harden. Spread some frosting on the cut side (where the dome was removed) of the third 6-inch cake layer. Remove the cakes from the freezer. Smooth out any imperfection in the frosting with your hands. Pour about 1 cup of the raspberry sauce into the well in the center of the layered 6-inch cake to fill it just to the top. Invert the third 6-inch cake layer on top, cut side down to enclose and seal the well. Frost the top layer with a crumb coat and place back in the freezer for 15 minutes to harden. Frost the 10-inch cake so it is completely coated and smooth. Remove the 6-inch cake from the freezer and frost it so it is completely coated and smooth. Carefully place the 6-inch cake on top of the 10-inch cake so that it is centered in the middle to form 2 tiers. Arrange the meringue bones upright around the outside of each tier of the cake. Decorate the top of the cake with more of the bones and any other edible Halloween decorations like white chocolate skulls. Slice the top tier and remove the slice to allow the bloody raspberry sauce core to pour down onto the bottom tier of the cake. Slice the rest of the cake and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 39531,&quot;Prosciutto-Wrapped Grilled Brie with Pineapple One 1-inch-thick slice pineapple, peeled and cored One 8- to 12-ounce wheel Brie or Camembert, cut in half horizontally 8 slices prosciutto (about 8 ounces) Crackers and bread, for serving Instructions: Prepare a grill for direct and indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the side burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Grill the pineapple over direct heat until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Let cool 5 minutes, then place on the cut side of one of the cheese halves. Place the other piece of cheese on top with the cut side touching the pineapple. Lay the prosciutto slices out on a work surface so they overlap in the middle and look like the spokes of a wheel. Put the cheese and pineapple round in the middle of the prosciutto and bring up one slice at a time to cover. The cheese and pineapple should be fully wrapped in prosciutto.<br> Grill over direct heat until starting to turn golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook until golden and crisp on the other side, about 3 minutes. Move to indirect heat and cover the grill. Cook until hot throughout and gooey, 5 to 8 minutes more depending on your grill. Serve immediately with crackers and bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 39532,&quot;Roasted Peppers 4 red peppers 4 yellow peppers 4 tablespoons olive oil Salt and pepper Instructions: Roast peppers by placing them on gas stove or open flame.

Adjust the rack to the lower third of the oven. Brush the inside of 8 (8-ounce) ramekins or 1 large souffle dish with melted butter and then lightly but completely dust the inside with sugar. Whisk together the caramel sauce and egg yolks in a medium bowl. This mixture is the souffle base. Using a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or a hand mixer, whip the egg whites for about 30 seconds or until soft foam appears. Add the cream of tartar and continue to whip the whites for 2 minutes. Add the sugar and beat until the egg whites reach the medium-stiff peak stage. Using a rubber spatula, fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the caramel mixture to lighten the base. Fold in the remaining whites carefully so that the mixture is not deflated. The most efficient way to fold is to rotate the bowl and spatula simultaneously in opposite directions, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Spoon the souffle into the dish or dishes, filling them to the rim. Flatten the top with a metal spatula. Gently run a paring knife around the inner wall of the ramekin. This created a small wall of air between the souffle and the ramekin, which helps the souffle rise up straight. Place the souffles on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes for individual souffles or 30 to 40 minutes for a large souffle. When finished, the souffles should be tall, golden brown, dry on the edges and a little creamy in the center. Serve immediately. Caramel sauce is perhaps the most versatile incarnation of caramel. Besides being both a hot and cold sauce, it makes a great filling for tarts and other pastries. It is also a major ingredient in some of my other recipes, such as truffles that I make with Caramel Ganache and Caramel Souffle. I always keep a variety of caramel blends refrigerated in my bakeshop. They last for weeks and are ready at a moment&#39;s notice to fulfill the inevitable special request. When I make creamy and clear caramels that have liquid added to them, I take the caramel to a high temperature, because I want a more, intense flavor that won&#39;t be diluted when the caramel is stretched. For example, you&#39;ll be heating the sugar to 375 degrees F in this recipe and you&#39;ll want to watch it carefully so it doesn&#39;t burn. Adding any liquid to hot caramel will cause it to bubble up like an eruption of molten lava. Using a pot that is at least twice the volume of the ingredients will prevent boil-over. Heating the liquid first reduces the volatility of this reaction but does not eliminate it, so be prepared. Oven mitts and a long-handled whisk are helpful, and don&#39;t stick your head or arms directly over the pot. It is important to remember that the steam rising out of a pot of hot caramel is as hot as the caramel inside, and nothing is as painful as a steam burn. Creme fraiche adds the perfect balance to this sauce, taming the sweetness with a touch of acidity. If you can&#39;t find it, and don&#39;t have time to make it, sour cream is a good substitute. I also balance the flavor of this sauce with a second addition of sugar and a little lemon juice at the very end. This adds another subtle dimension of flavor. Heat a saucepan of water and place a whisk in it. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly. Combine the water, 1 cup of sugar, and the corn syrup in a medium saucepan. Stir them together with very clean fingers, making sure no lumps of dry sugar remain. Brush down the insides of the pan with a little water, using your hand to feel for any stray granules of sugar. Cover the saucepan and place it over medium heat for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes, remove the lid, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Do not stir from this point on. Keep an eye on the pan. It will be very bubbly. When stray sugar crystals appear on the side of the pan, brush them down with a wet pastry brush. As the sugar cooks, the bubbles will get larger. Insert a candy thermometer, and when the temperature reaches 300 degrees F, lower the heat to medium, which will slow the cooking. Continue to cook the sugar until it reaches 350 degrees F. It will be dark brown. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 1 minute, or until the bubbles subside. Add the cream to the caramel. It will bubble up vigorously, so be careful. Vigorously whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, creme fraiche, lemon juice, and salt. This sauce is now ready to be served warm or cooled to room temperature. It will keep stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. When cold, it has the consistency of peanut butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 39534,&quot;Pulled Whisky Chicken BLT Sandwiches 1 tablespoon EVOO 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 2 large shallots, finely chopped<br> 1 cup organic ketchup<br> 1 cup chicken stock from Poached Chicken, recipe follows 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons dark amber grade A maple syrup<br> 2 tablespoons cider vinegar<br> 2 shots whiskey or bourbon whiskey<br> Coarse black pepper 1 1/2 pounds cooked pulled Poached Chicken, recipe follows 12 slices smoky good quality bacon<br> Hard rolls (seeded or plain), split<br> Lettuce, for serving Sliced red onion, for serving Sliced tomatoes, for serving Sliced dill or bread and butter pickles, for serving 1 whole chicken, 4 to 5 pounds 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns<br> 2 ribs celery, coarsely chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 1 large fresh bay leaf 1 carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped<br> 1 lemon, sliced<br> 1 onion, peeled and quartered<br> Herb bundle of fresh parsley, rosemary and thyme<br> Herb bundle of fresh parsley, rosemary and thyme Salt<br> Instructions: Heat the EVOO in a skillet over medium-high heat.

Rinse the chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. Working in batches, lightly coat the chicken with the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add some of the chicken to the pan. Cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Add the onion to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add the carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook for 10 minutes. Crush the tomatoes and stir them into the vegetables. Add the wine and the remaining salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken, reduce heat, and cover. Simmer for 45 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Stir in the parsley and serve on individual plates. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Rioja, Syrah]&quot; 39541,&quot;Shellfish, Fennel and White Bean Salad 3/4 pound squid, cleaned, tentacles removed and body sacs cut into 1/4-inch rings 3/4 pound shrimp, (same size as squid) shelled and deveined 1 1/2 cups cooked cannellini beans 1/2 cup thinly sliced fennel 1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar 2 teaspoons dijon mustard Salt and pepper to taste 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, dill or chervil Instructions: In a saucepan of boiling salted water add the shellfish and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until just firm.

Garnish with the herbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 39542,&quot;Latkes 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated 1 medium onion, grated 1 1/4 cups matzo meal 3/4 cup chopped fresh chives 5 large eggs 1 tablespoon kosher salt, such as Diamond Crystal 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Canola oil 1 pound celery root, peeled and grated 1 pound parsnips, grated 3/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 3- to 4-pound butternut squash, peeled, seeds and pith removed 1 cup matzo meal 1/2 cup chopped fresh sage 1 teaspoon kosher salt, such as Diamond Crystal 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the potato latkes: Place the grated potatoes in a large bowl or other food-safe container, fill it with water, and then strain. Repeat this rinsing process 2 or 3 times until the water runs clear, then drain the potatoes, squeezing out as much water as possible. Combine the rinsed potatoes and grated onion in a large bowl and mix them together with your hands. Add the matzo meal and mix together, then add the chives. Finally, add the eggs and massage them into the potato mixture until thoroughly incorporated. Add the salt and pepper and mix it in with your hands. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches so that the latkes are not crowded in the skillet, take a golf ball-size portion of the potato mixture, flatten it between the palms of your hands, and add it to the skillet. Repeat. Cook the latkes until they&#39;re crisp and brown around the edges, about 3 minutes; then flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until crisp and deep golden brown all over and still tender inside. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture, adding a tablespoon or so of oil between batches. For the celery root-parsnip latkes: Follow the instructions for the potato version, substituting the celery root and parsnips for the potatoes (and skipping the rinsing step at the beginning) and substituting the parsley for the chives. For the butternut squash latkes: Cut the squash into chunks and pass them through the grating disk of a food processor. Then follow the instructions for the potato version, substituting the squash for the potatoes (and skipping the rinsing step at the beginning) and substituting the sage for the chives, and cooking the latkes slightly longer over slightly lower heat (about 4 minutes on the first side and 3 minutes on the second side over medium-low heat). You can reheat the latkes in a 450 degree F oven in 3 to 4 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 39543,&quot;Sheet Pan Eggs Olive oil, for the pan 12 large eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Butter a 9-inch loaf pan.<br> Place the egg in a medium bowl; whisk in the milk and 4 tablespoons butter. (It&#39;s okay if there are still small chunks of butter remaining after whisking.)<br> In a large bowl, mix together the flours, baking powder, rosemary and salt with a fork. Add the egg mixture and stir with a wooden spoon just until combined. Sprinkle the raisins and goat cheese over the batter; gently fold in with just 2 or 3 strokes.<br> Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the bread comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes.

Wash your chicken inside and out and pat dry with kitchen paper. Using your fingers, part the breast skin from the breast meat. It&#39;s important to try to push your hand gently down the breast, being careful not to rip the skin. With a peeler, remove and chop the fragrant yellow skin of the lemon, keeping the peeled lemon to one side. Chop prosciutto and add to the bowl with the lemon skin, garlic and thyme. Season, with salt and pepper and then mix it all into the butter. Push this into the space you have made between the meat and the skin -- rub and massage any that&#39;s left over in and around the bird. It&#39;s all tasty stuff. I could tell you to tie the chicken up but I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s a palaver and not worth it in this case. Slash the thigh meat to allow the heat to penetrate a little more, which makes it taste better. Cut the peeled lemon in half and push it into the cavity. Then put chicken in the hot roasting tray and roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, parboil the potatoes in salted water for 10 minutes and drain. Cut the celeriac into irregular chunks around the same size as the potatoes. Remove the chicken from the oven, by which time the tasty butter will have melted, flavored and cooked out of the chicken into the bottom of the tray, awaiting your potatoes and celeriac. Normally I put a fork into the cavity of the chicken and lift it off of the tray for 20 seconds while I toss and coat the vegetables in the butter. Put the chicken back on top of the vegetables and cook for around 40 minutes. Leave to stand for 10 minutes. Once the meat and vegetables have been removed, a little light gravy can be made in the tray with a splash of wine and stock, a little simmering and scraping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 39548,&quot;Grilled Pizza Margherita 3 cups canned plum tomatoes in thick puree, crushed up 3/4 cup chopped fresh basil 1 cup extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 2 1/4 cups grated Romano cheese 2 1/4 cups grated fontina cheese 3 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley Mashed potatoes, if desired (see recipes below) 1 recipe pizza dough divided into 6 pieces (recipe below) 3 cups canned plum tomatoes in thick puree, crushed up 3/4 cup chopped fresh basil 1 cup extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 2 1/4 cups grated Romano cheese 2 1/4 cups grated fontina cheese 3 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley Mashed potatoes, if desired (see recipes below) 1 recipe pizza dough divided into 6 pieces (recipe below) 11 ounces lukewarm water 1 teaspoon fresh yeast 1 tablespoon molasses 2 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 3 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1/3 cup whole wheat flour 11 ounces lukewarm water 1 teaspoon fresh yeast 1 tablespoon molasses 2 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 3 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1/3 cup whole wheat flour Instructions: In a bowl, combine the tomatoes in puree, basil, 1/4 cup of the olive oil and the garlic.

Blend until completely smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in the dill and parsley. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. The texture should be similar to ranch salad dressing. (If the sauce is very thick, thin it out with 1 to 2 tablespoons of additional water.) Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. For the egg rolls: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Rub the chicken breasts with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Cook the chicken until deep grill marks appear, about 8 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until deep grill marks appear and the internal temperature on an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part of the breast registers 165 degrees F, about 8 minutes more. Remove to a cutting board, allow to cool slightly and cut into small pieces.<br> Heat the remaining tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring, until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the beans, corn, spinach, cumin, chipotle powder, cayenne, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables and beans are coated in the spices and warmed through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the chicken, pickled jalapenos, parsley and scallions. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Allow the mixture to cool completely. Stack the tortillas on a large microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave until just warmed though. (This will make the tortillas easier to roll.) Put a warm tortilla on a clean, flat surface (keep the remaining tortillas covered with the damp paper towels) and put 1/2 cup of the filling in the center. Spread the filling out into a 4 1/2-inch long log. Tightly fold the bottom of the tortilla (the part that is closest to you) over the filling, fold both ends over then roll the tortilla so that the filling is completely enclosed. Seal the seam of the tortilla with 3 toothpicks. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, filling and toothpicks.<br> Meanwhile, attach a deep-fat fry thermometer to the side of a large Dutch oven or pot, fill halfway with oil and heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the egg rolls in 2 batches until golden brown all over, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove the toothpicks from the egg rolls, cut on an extreme bias and transfer to a large platter. Serve with the avocado dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 39565,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Twisted Bacon 1 pound bacon strips 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves (from like a zillion sprigs) 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1 teaspoon smoked or hot paprika 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Hold the cobs over a large saucepan and use the back of a knife to scrape down the cobs to \\milk\\ them of any corn liquid. Drop the scraped cobs into the saucepan and add 8 cups of water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until the liquid is reduced to 6 cups, about 30 minutes. Strain and keep warm. Make the risotto: Heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the onion is translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Add the corn kernels and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the corn just starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the oats and stir until coated. Add 1 cup of wine and simmer, stirring constantly, until the wine is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups of the warm corn broth to the oats. Simmer, stirring constantly, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 2 more cups of broth and simmer, stirring constantly, until the oats are tender but slightly toothsome, about 10 to 12 minutes more. Remove from the heat, stir in the Parmesan and season to taste with salt. Adjust the consistency of the risotto by adding more of the broth as necessary. Cover and set aside to keep warm. Make the shrimp: Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the shrimp in one crowded layer and cook until the shrimp are a deep pinkish orange on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the shrimp over, add the remaining 1/2 cup wine, garlic and red pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until the shrimp is opaque throughout and the wine has reduced slightly. Add the lemon juice, parsley, remaining 1 tablespoon butter and salt to taste. Remove from the heat, swirl the skillet until the butter melts and toss the shrimp to coat in the sauce.

Spray with nonstick baking spray and set aside. Cream the granulated sugar, butter, brown sugar and oil in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, sift together the flour, cinnamon, cardamom, baking powder, ginger, nutmeg, salt and cloves in a medium bowl; set aside.<br> Beat the eggs into the butter mixture one at a time, beating and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula after each addition. Continue to beat until the batter turns pale yellow, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla bean paste and mix to combine. Turn the mixer to low speed and alternate adding the flour mixture and buttermilk, starting and ending with the flour mixture and mixing each addition until just barely combined (be careful not to overmix).<br> Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cake pans (about 2 1/2 cups per pan); tap each pan on the counter to ensure the batter is spread out evenly. Bake, rotating the pans midway through, until the centers of the cakes spring back when gently pressed or a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes, then release the sides of the cakes by running a butter knife around the edges of each pan. Allow the cakes to cool completely before removing them from the pans. For the buttercream: Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on low speed until foamy, then turn to high and whip until it holds stiff peaks.<br> Combine the granulated sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring to a soft-ball stage, about 235 degrees F, without stirring, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> With the mixer on high speed, pour the sugar syrup in a stream along the side of the bowl into the egg whites. Beat until the bowl is just barely warm to the touch and the egg whites are shiny and form stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the butter one piece at a time, beating after each addition, until all the butter has been added. Turn the mixer to medium-high speed and beat until the buttercream is shiny and holds a peak when spooned upwards with a spatula, about 2 minutes. Turn to medium speed and beat in the espresso, cocoa, cinnamon and salt until just combined.<br> To assemble: Place a cake layer on a cake turntable and trim off the domed top using a serrated knife so the cake is level. Remove the cake layer and repeat with the remaining 2 cake layers. Spread a dollop of buttercream on an 8-inch cake board and place one of the layers on top, cut-side down. Place the cake board on the turntable. Scoop 1 1/2 cups buttercream on top of the cake layer. Use an offset spatula to spread the buttercream evenly across the top of the cake. Place the next cake layer on top, cut-side up. Top the second layer with 1 1/2 cups buttercream and spread evenly across the top of the layer. Top with the third cake layer, cut-side down. Spread 1 1/2 cups buttercream evenly over the top of the cake, allowing the buttercream to hang over the edge.<br> Use an offset spatula to smooth out the buttercream on the sides of the cake. If there is not enough on the cake, take small scoops of the buttercream using your offset spatula and spread a thin layer of buttercream around the sides of the cake. (The cake should show through this layer.) Use the offset spatula to finish the top edge of the cake by holding the spatula parallel with the top of the cake and pulling towards the center in short strokes. Repeat all the way around the edge of the cake, so no rough edges remain. The sides of the cake should be lightly coated in buttercream, while the top should have a thicker layer, about 1/4 inch thick. Chill the cake until firm to the touch, about 1 hour. Dip the metal offset spatula into a tall glass filled with hot water. Use the warmed spatula to smooth the top of the cake again by holding the spatula parallel with the cake and pulling towards the center in short strokes. Divide the remaining buttercream between one piping bag fitted with a large round tip and one piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Working in a crescent-moon shape around the top of the cake, pipe kisses of buttercream in varying sizes, alternating between the round tip and the star tip.<br> For the decorations: Decorate the top of the cake with the star anise, cinnamon sticks and chocolate-covered espresso beans. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 39593,&quot;5-Ingredient Strawberry and Black Quinoa Salad 3/4 cup black quinoa 6 cups flavorful green salad mix, like baby spinach, arugula, chard and herbs 2 cups sliced strawberries 2 cups sliced or chopped cooked rotisserie chicken breast 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar Instructions: Put the quinoa in a medium pot and cover with cold water; let soak 5 minutes.

Set aside. For the quick and easy mac and three cheeses: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook according to the package directions. Heat the milk and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the fontina, Cheddar jack and processed cheese and cook, stirring, until melted. Stir in the pepper and salt. Drain the macaroni and stir it into the cheese sauce. Keep warm. For the onion strings: Begin by peeling the onions and slicing them very thinly; use a mandoline slicer if you can. Separate the onion slices, put them in a shallow baking dish and pour the buttermilk over the top. Press the onions down so they&#39;re submerged as much as possible and let them soak on the counter for at least an hour. If necessary, stir them around a bit halfway through the soaking process. In a bowl, combine the flour, cayenne, kosher salt, seasoned salt and black pepper and set aside. Pour 1 to 2 quarts canola oil in a pot or Dutch oven. Heat to 360 degrees F, or until a pinch of flour sizzles when sprinkled over the pot. Using tongs, remove a handful of onions from the buttermilk and immediately dunk into the flour mixture. Coat the onions in the flour mixture, then tap them on the inside of the bowl to shake off the excess. Plunge the onions in the hot oil. With a spoon, fiddle with them a bit just to break them up and watch them! They&#39;ll be ready to remove from the oil in no time flat. When they&#39;re golden brown (this should take just a minute or two), remove them from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining onion slices and serve immediately.

Pierce the sweet potatoes all over with a fork. Bake on a sheet tray until tender, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes. Allow the sweet potatoes to cool slightly, then cut them in half and scoop the flesh into a bowl, keeping the skins intact. Set aside the skins on a sheet tray. Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned, about 4 minutes, then add the shallots and allow to soften for about 1 minute. Add the pine nuts and stir to combine, allowing them to be coated in the fat. Stir in the raisins, sage and nutmeg, then remove from the heat. Transfer the mixture to the bowl with the sweet potato flesh and allow to cool completely in the refrigerator, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, place the ricotta in a strainer over a bowl and allow to strain for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Add the breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a bunch of grinds of pepper (about 20 grinds) and cook, stirring constantly, until the crumbs are golden brown, about 5 minutes. It&#39;s important to stir the whole time to make sure that they do not burn--which will happen if they sit too long in the skillet untouched. Once golden, immediately transfer them to a plate to cool and stop the cooking process. Set aside. Whisk the yogurt, mustard, Worcestershire, lemon zest and juice, garlic, 3 tablespoons water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and about 20 grinds of black pepper in a small bowl until smooth, creamy and combined.

In another small bowl, combine the brown sugar, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper and stir until well-combined. Set aside. Place the pecans in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until they just start to brown and smell toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the butter to the pan and stir until the butter is completely melted and the pecans are coated. Add the sugar and spice mixture to the pan and stir to combine. Turn off the heat and immediately pour in the cherries and bourbon. Stir for 1-2 minutes more, off heat, until everything is well incorporated. Return the pan to medium heat and continue to stir everything in the pan until the liquid thickens and a glaze forms on the pecans, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the pecans to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, separate the pecans and spread them into an even layer on the parchment paper. Allow the pecans to cool completely. Once the pecans have cooled, zest the orange over the pecans.

Put potatoes in a large pot and fill with water until potatoes are just covered. Add the 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are very soft, about 40 minutes. Press potatoes through a potato ricer or pulse in a bowl with an immersion hand blender until they are mashed. Let sit for a few minutes until just cool enough to handle. Cut the white cheese in 1/2-inch cubes. Prepare a baking sheet with foil wrap and coat with vegetable spray or rub with oil. Put bread crumbs in a small bowl. While mashed potatoes are still warm, form into 2-inch balls and insert 1 cheese cube in center, then roll into bread crumbs and place on cookie sheet. Wash hands and dry after every third ball so the potatoes will form evenly and not stick to the bread crumbs in your hand. Quantity should make about 10 balls. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39608,&quot;Baked Branzino with Citrus Gremolata 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for the pan Six 3- to 4-ounce branzino fillets, bones removed<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 lemons<br> 2 oranges<br> 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon good-quality extra-virgin olive oil<br> Pinch crushed red pepper flakes<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Generously grease a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Arrange the fillets on the baking sheet in one layer. Drizzle the 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the fish and season with salt and black pepper. Bake until the fish is flaky and just fully cooked through, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and 1 orange into a small bowl and add the parsley, good olive oil, red pepper flakes, a pinch of salt, a few grinds of black pepper, juice of half the lemon and juice of half the orange. Stir gently to combine. Slice the remaining lemon and orange. Serve the fish topped with the gremolata and citrus slices. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 39609,&quot;Salt-Grilled Spanish Mackerel 4 mackerel fillets, 4 to 5 ounces each 2 tablespoons sake (Japanese rice wine) 1/2 teaspoon salt, preferably coarse 1/2 lemon 1/2 cup grated daikon (Japanese white radish), optional Soy sauce, optional Instructions: Rinse each of the fish steaks under fresh cold water, then pat them dry. Let the fish marinate in the rice wine for 5 to 10 minutes, turning the fish once halfway through. Preheat your broiler to the highest setting possible, or if you are grilling outdoors, make sure your coals are burning hot. Remove the fish from the marinade, and very lightly salt the flesh on both sides. Salt the surrounding skin a bit more generously. Place the fish on a rack set over a foil-lined tray, or use disposable foil broiling pans for easier cleanup. If you are broiling outdoors, you may wish to lightly oil the rack on which the fish will be laid. Broil the fish for 6 to 7 minutes, or until it is opaque and slightly browned around the edges. Flip the fish with a large metal spatula, and broil for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the fish is just cooked through. Cut the lemon into 4 wedges, and serve each piece of fish with one of them. The Japanese typically serve a small mound of grated radish to the side of the fish. Each person then dribbles some soy sauce over the radish and spread this mixture on the fish just before conveying it to the mouth. If you wish to follow suit, drain the grated radish of excess liquid before mounding it on the plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 39610,&quot;Mac N Cheese Study 1/4 pound Humbolt Fog cheese (Cypress Grove) 6 ounces goat cheese (Colorado), divided (recommended: Haystack Mountain Snowdrop) 1/2 pound goat cheese (Italy) (recommended: Brunet) 1/4 pound mild semi-hard cheese (recommended: Old Kentucky Tomme) 1 pound goat cheese (Spain) (recommended: Pata Cabra) 5 ounces goat Gouda (Holland) (recommended: Ballerina) 2 lemons 2 teaspoons smoked hot paprika Finely ground Mediterranean sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 quarts shrimp stock or water 1 pound strozzapreti pasta, dry (recommended: Montebello Organic) 1 pound tubetti lisci pasta, dry (recommended: Pastificio Riscossa #64) 4 artichokes 8 garlic cloves, peeled 7 bay leaves Olive oil 1/4 pound pancetta, thickly sliced (recommended: Golden Farms) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons garlic granules 2 teaspoons Spanish paprika 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons crushed Italian seasoning 3 egg whites Sugar Snipped fresh chives Instructions: Grate all the cheeses and keep separated. Zest 2/3 lemon into goat gouda. Add smoked paprika and salt and pepper and blend. Bring shrimp stock or water to a boil. Add strozzapreti and tubetti pastas. Bring water back to a boil and cook about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside. Peel fresh artichokes down to heart, removing choke. Boil artichokes to a soft-firm (about 20 minutes). Roast your artichoke hearts with lemon juice, salt, pepper, garlic, bay leaves and a splash of olive oil for 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degrees F oven. Chop artichokes into 1 1/2-inch chunks and set aside. Rough chop and saute your pancetta in pan until just crispy on outside- do not overcook. For the sauce: Start by melting the butter. Then add a tablespoon all purpose flour and whisk together to create a roux. Add cream, then garlic granules, Spanish paprika, salt, red pepper flakes, cayenne, Italian seasoning and the juice of 1/2 lemon. Add your cheeses 1 at a time: first the melted Pata Cabra goat cheese, then your Humboldt fog and goat cheeses. Reserve 2 ounces of the Haystack for final garnish. Fold in egg whites. Blend until all cheese is melted. Add pancetta and artichokes. Now add your cooked pasta to mixture, making sure all the pasta is coated. You can cook for just a bit longer. Add salt, to taste, as needed. Place into small bowls and garnish with remaining goat cheese. Sprinkle sugar onto the cheese and brulee with a kitchen torch. Garnish with chives and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 39611,&quot;Chicken Marsala 1 pound chicken tenders Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 tablespoons dried porcini mushrooms<br> 2 shallots, minced<br> 2 teaspoons unflavored powdered gelatin<br> 3/4 cup chicken broth 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup dry Marsala wine<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br> Warm crusty Italian bread, for serving, optional Instructions: Season the chicken tenders with salt and pepper, then dredge in the flour, shaking off excess. Heat a 12- to 14-inch nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and brown each side of the chicken until golden brown, 2 minutes a side (you want to actually undercook the chicken a bit; it will finish in the pan later). Transfer the chicken to a plate. To the same pan, add the cremini mushrooms, butter, dried porcini and shallots and cook until deeply caramelized, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the gelatin and 1/4 cup of the broth together and let sit to bloom. Add the garlic to the pan and cook for another 20 seconds. Deglaze with the Marsala, scraping up any bits. Whisk in the remaining broth and the gelatin mixture and bring to a simmer. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Nestle the browned chicken in the pan and gently simmer for 3 minutes. Top with the fresh parsley and lemon juice. Serve with warm crusty Italian bread. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 39612,&quot;Dulce De Leche 3 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk Regular bananas Small bananas, like Manzano or red Strawberries Marshmallows Toasted cubes pound cake Pineapple chunks Anjou or Bartlett pear slices, unpeeled Fried wonton wrappers Bing cherries, with stem Instructions: Equipment: Fondue pot; fondue forks or wooden or metal skewers Make the Fondue: Remove label from the cans. Stand the cans in a saucepan and add water to cover. (Note: Do NOT open or puncture the can in any way prior to cooking.) Bring the water to a gentle simmer and keep it there for 3 hours, adding water as needed to keep the cans submerged. Allow the cans to cool before opening.

Starting at one end, insert the tip of a knife between the membrane and the bones to loosen the membrane, then pull it off. Flip the ribs so they are meat-side up. Rub each rack with 1 tablespoon scotch, if using. Combine the brown sugar, 5 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, the ground ginger and paprika in a small bowl. Rub the ribs on both sides with the spice mixture. Wrap each rack in heavy-duty foil, then wrap in another layer of foil, making sure the seam is on the opposite side to prevent leaking. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Preheat a grill to medium low (350 degrees F on gas or 335 degrees F on charcoal). Put the foil-wrapped ribs meat-side down on the grates. Grill, carefully flipping the ribs every 30 minutes, until the meat is tender but not falling apart and the tip of a paring knife inserted into the ribs meets slight resistance, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (If using charcoal, add more coals as needed so the temperature stays between 300 degrees F and 325 degrees F.) Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and fresh ginger and cook, stirring often, until just beginning to brown, 5 to 6 minutes. If using the scotch, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the scotch, then return to the heat and cook until almost dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup water, the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, mustard, chili-garlic sauce and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and glossy, about 30 minutes; you should have about 1 1/2 cups sauce. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. (You can make the sauce up to 1 day ahead; refrigerate until ready to use.) Divide the sauce between 2 bowls\\u2014half for cooking and half for serving. When the ribs are ready, transfer to a baking sheet. Unwrap and discard the foil and any accumulated juices. Brush the meat side with the barbecue sauce and return to the grill, meat-side up. Cover and grill, moving the ribs around to prevent flare-ups, until the sauce cooks in, about 5 minutes. Brush the ribs with more sauce, flip and cook until lightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the ribs so they\\u2019re meat-side up again, brush with more sauce and grill 5 more minutes. Flip the ribs again and brush the bone side with sauce, then flip again and brush the meat side one last time. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes. Cut the racks into individual ribs.

On medium speed, or using your fingers, mix in the egg yolks, oil and 1 tablespoon water, adding them one ingredient at a time and mixing just until the dough comes together, 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough seems dry, add another tablespoon of water. Knead in the mixer on medium speed for 4 to 5 minutes, or turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and use the palms of your hands to knead the dough until it feels silky and smooth, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Shape the dough into a ball, cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.<br> To roll the dough, cut it into 4 equal pieces. Let the pieces sit, covered, at room temperature for 10 minutes if chilled.<br> Shape each piece into an oval wide enough to fit the width of your pasta roller. Lightly flour your work surface and set the pasta roller to its widest setting. Lightly flour one piece of dough, pass it through the roller and then lightly dust the rolled dough with flour, brushing off the excess with your hands. Pass the dough through the widest setting again. Lower the setting by 1 notch and continue to pass the dough through until you&#39;ve reached the desired thickness. The thinner the better in my opinion.<br> For the filling: Combine the ricotta, pesto and egg in a medium bowl.<br> Form the ravioli with 1 tablespoon of filling in each. You can make them with a tray mold, stamp or by hand, with many options for shapes and sizes.<br> Place the ravioli on a baking sheet lined with a kitchen towel or parchment paper that has been dusted with flour to prevent them from sticking.

Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F. Whisk together the egg, milk and vanilla in a medium bowl. Add the pancake mix and sugar and whisk until smooth. The batter should be the consistency of thick cake batter to allow it to coat the cookie and hold its shape. If necessary, adjust the consistency by adding more pancake mix 1 tablespoon at a time.<br> Line the basket of the air fryer with a parchment piece and spray lightly with cooking spray. Dip 6 cookies in the batter, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Arrange the cookies on the parchment in a single layer without touching. (Make sure to place a cookie on each of the four corners so the parchment doesn\\u2019t fly up during cooking.) Air fry at 350 degrees F until the battered coating is golden brown and puffed, about 7 minutes.

Unwind the pancetta into a long strip and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch wide pieces. Heat together the pancetta and the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook slowly until well-browned and crisp. Tilt the pan to collect the fat in a little pool against the side and scrape the pancetta into the fat. Cook for another minute to make sure the pancetta is very crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Set the pancetta aside. There should be about 2 tablespoons fat remaining in the pan. If not, add a little olive oil. Turn the heat to medium-high and heat until hot. Add the garlic and saute briefly until light brown. Add the thyme, stir, add the stock, and bring to a boil. Cook until reduced by about half. Add the broccoli rabe, season with salt and pepper, toss well, cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour the polenta into a warm serving dish or bowl and pour the vegetables over it. Sprinkle with the reserved pancetta. Combine the stock and cream in a heavy saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Whisk in the polenta and semolina, and cook over very low heat, whisking regularly, until the grains are soft, about 8 minutes. Whisk in the cheeses. Serve immediately or reserve. To encourage polenta to come cleanly out of the pan, put the pan over medium heat. Run a spatula or wooden spoon around the sides of the pan to clean off the polenta. Do not stir, but wait and watch for a few seconds until a large bubble begins to form and push the polenta upward. Pour immediately into a warm dish. The polenta can be made ahead and reheated: add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water or stock, cover the dish, and reheat in the microwave or over low heat. Whisk well before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 39656,&quot;Morning Glory Muffins 1 cup vegetable oil, plus extra for the pan (see Cook&#39;s Notes) 3 extra-large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 cups grated carrots, unpeeled and grated on a box grater 1 Granny Smith apple, unpeeled and grated on a box grater 1 (8-ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained 1/2 cup pecans, roughly chopped 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/2 cup raisins 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350? and arrange two racks evenly spaced in the oven.

Add the butter and continue pulsing until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the water by drizzling about 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each drizzle. Stop once the dough begins to come together. Transfer the dough to a board and use the heel of your hand or a pastry scraper to press it together. Pat into a disk approximately 6 inches in diameter, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough to a 13 to 14-inch circle, flouring the dough and board as necessary to keep it from sticking. Roll up the dough around the rolling pin and unroll it into the tart pan. Gently lift the edges to ease the dough into the corners of the pan, then push the dough down gently to be certain the dough around the sides is 1/4 inch thick. Use a paring knife to cut excess dough from the rim of the pan. If necessary, pat a bit of the dough trimmings into any thin spots. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 375degreesF. Place the tart pan on a baking sheet. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, line with aluminum foil or parchment paper, and fill with pie weights or dry beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights, and continue to bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden. Sprinkle the chopped chocolate evenly over the bottom of the crust and bake for an additional minute, just to melt the chocolate. Remove from the oven and use the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula to spread the chocolate in an even layer. Let cool on a rack while you prepare the filling. Raise the oven temperature to 400degreesF. To make the filling: In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water and stir over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, without stirring, swirling the pan so the caramel colors evenly. If sugar crystals form on the sides of the pan, brush with a wet pastry brush. Test the color of the caramel by drizzling a few drops onto a white plate. When the color is medium to dark amber, remove from the heat. Slowly and carefully - it will bubble up - add the cream. Return the caramel to medium heat and cook for 3 minutes to thicken slightly, reducing the heat to medium-low if the caramel bubbles too much. Remove from the heat and cool for 15 minutes. Place the tart shell on a baking sheet. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vanilla, egg, and yolk. Slowly whisk into the caramel. Stir in the melted butter, followed by the nuts and nibs, if using. Pour the filling into the prepared tart shell. The filling will come to the top of the shell. (If the crust has shrunk during baking, it may not hold all the filling.) Bake the tart for 15 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 375degreesF and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the filling is set. Let cool on a rack for about 10 minutes. While still warm, move the tart in the pan to loosen the edges where the caramel has stuck, but keep it in the pan. Let cool completely before removing the tart ring. Serve each wedge of tart with a dollop of the cocoa whipped cream. Cocoa Whipped Cream: Place the cream in a chilled metal bowl or mixer bowl. With a whisk, or the whisk attachment, whip the cream until slightly frothy. Combine the sugar with the cocoa powder. Sprinkle into the cream and continue to whip until soft peaks form. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 39660,&quot;Apple and Onion Confit Crostini 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large onion, thinly sliced 1 green apple, such as Granny Smith, unpeeled, cored, and thinly sliced 1 red apple, such as Washington, unpeeled, cored, and thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons maple syrup 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 French baguette, thinly sliced into 26 (1/4 to 1/2-inch thick) slices Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 3 ounces creamy gorgonzola cheese sliced into 26 (1/4-inch thick) 1-inch squares Instructions: For the confit: In a high-sided skillet, heat the butter and oil over medium heat. Add the onions, apple slices, salt, and pepper. Cook until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the vinegar, maple syrup, and thyme. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions and apples are very soft, about 50 minutes. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with oil and bake until lightly golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place the gorgonzola squares on top of the warm toasts. Spoon the confit on top of the cheese. Sprinkle with chopped thyme and serve. Cook&#39;s Note: Freeze the gorgonzola for 20 minutes for easier slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 39661,&quot;Kyoto-Style Cold Brew Coffee 2 (3-liter) plastic soda bottles, cleaned 1 utility knife (box cutter) with a locking blade<br> 1 thumbtack<br> 1 (10- by 2 1/2-inch) piece cheesecloth<br> 1 large glass pitcher<br> 2 rulers or paint stirring sticks<br> 2 medium rubber bands<br> 1 large (9 1/2-inch) paper coffee filter<br> 1 small (7 3/4-inch) coffee filter<br> 110 grams (1 1/2 cups) coarse-ground coffee 125 grams (1/2 cup) filtered water, at 200 degrees F (see Chef\\u2019s Note)<br> 900 grams (about 7 cups) ice cubes, plus more for serving (optional)<br> Instructions: I\\u2019m just going to say this once: BE CAREFUL. We\\u2019re hacking soda bottles with a box cutter here so take precautions, go slowly, and always cut away from anything that can bleed. There, I said it. Also (and I hope obviously), don\\u2019t let kids attempt this. Set the blade of the utility knife so that it\\u2019s sticking about a quarter of an inch out of its handle and cut the bottom 3 inches off both soda bottles. Discard the bottoms. Remove the bottle lids. Cut an asterisk-shaped hole in the first lid. (Try doing this with the cap upright rather than upside down. AND BE CAREFUL.) Use the thumbtack to poke a tiny hole right in the middle of the second cap. Screw both caps back onto the bottles. Wad up the cheesecloth and stuff it into the neck of the bottle with the asterisk-shaped hole. Place the bottle with the asterisk-shaped hole on top of the pitcher with the cap facing down and secure with the rulers and rubber bands. Place the coffee grounds into the large paper filter and set inside the bottle. Set this entire apparatus on top of a digital scale. Zero the scale, then slowly pour the water in a spiral over the grounds to bloom the coffee. This step should take about 30 seconds. Top with the small coffee filter, which will act as a diffuser. Nestle the bottle with the tiny hole, cap-down, onto the bottle holding the coffee. Zero the scale again and weigh the ice into the top bottle. Set your tower out of direct sunlight until all of the ice has melted and passed through the coffee, 10 to 12 hours. If you\\u2019re keeping an eye on the coffee-brewing process, you should see one drop of water moving through the coffee about every 7 seconds. Once the coffee is done brewing, remove the rig from the pitcher and discard or compost the coffee grounds.

Lightly butter 2 baking sheets.<br> Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer equipped with the paddle attachment-the one that looks like the peace sign-and beat until creamy and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg yolks and almond extract and beat for another minute or so, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.<br> In another large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and chopped almonds.<br> Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter-sugar mixture. When combined, the dough should be soft and homogeneous. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, until firm.<br> When you&#39;re ready to bake, take the dough out of the fridge and roll it into 3/4-inch balls. Place the balls about 1 inch apart on a prepared baking sheet. Using the tip of your thumb, make a hole as deep as you can in each doughball without actually poking through the bottom. Roll your thumb around a little bit to widen the hole-this is your thumbprint!<br> Bake the cookies for 16 to 18 minutes or until they begin to turn golden around the edges. Remove from the oven and cool. While the cookies are cooling, repoke each one with your thumb to create a really nice spot for the caramel. Repeat with the remaining dough.<br> For the caramel: In a medium saute pan, combine the sugar, lemon juice, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup water. Bring the pan to medium-high heat. Be careful not to swish the pan around as that can cause the sugar to recrystallize. As the mixture boils, the water will evaporate and the sugar will begin to turn brown, or \\caramelize.\\ This is the point when you DO NOT want to take your eyes off it! Things can take a turn for the worse here and there will be no recovery. As the sugar begins to turn gold and move toward golden brown, remove it from the heat and add the heavy cream. As you do this it will bubble up like crazy. Be sure to use a pan large enough to accommodate the bubbling-this stuff is molten and can cause a very severe burn. Whisk the cream until things settle down and the bubbles subside, then add the butter 2 pats at a time, making sure each addition is thoroughly incorporated before adding more.<br> Let the caramel cool slightly, then spoon it into the hole of each cookie and let cool. You&#39;ll most likely have leftover caramel sauce, so save it for something yummy-like pouring over vanilla ice cream! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39716,&quot;Mystery Rolls 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter 4 ounces crumbled blue cheese.<br> 1 can flaky biscuits Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a pie pan or other shallow, large dish, pour out the corn flakes. Crush the cereal up with your hands. Mix in bread crumbs, sugar, salt, pepper, and allspice - your SECRET ingredient. Do not tell anybody what your secret ingredient is - ever! If they ask how you make your special chicken toes, tell them about everything EXCEPT the secret. Drizzle about 3 tablespoons vegetable oil evenly over the breading, tossing and turning it to mix the oil all through the bread crumbs and crushed-up corn flakes. Have the GH pour the oil out slowly. A vegetable oil bottle has a big opening so, 3 tablespoons will pour out pretty quickly, probably by the time you can count to 5, so watch the GH closely and count really loudly! Have your GH cut the chicken fingers into toes, 2-inch pieces. Turn the chicken in flour, eggs and then in the special crunchy breading. Arrange the chicken toes on a nonstick baking sheet. Make your GH go and wash their hands. Place the chicken toes in the oven and cook 15 minutes or until crisp and brown all over. Mix together honey mustard and barbecue sauce in a small bowl. Serve hot chicken toes with honey mustard and barbecue sauce for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39725,&quot;Seared Five-Spice Duck Breast with Plum Wine Sauce 10 ounces boneless duck breast with skin 1 teaspoon five-spice powder 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger root 3 scallion heads white part only, finely chopped Salt and pepper 4 ounces sesame oil 2 cups duck stock or canned chicken stock 1 cup plum wine 1 ounce unsalted butter Instructions: Marinate the duck breast with 5 spice powder, ginger root, scallions, salt, pepper and sesame oil for at least 6 hours or overnight.

Place the potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with the olive oil and sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Bake until a knife inserted into the potatoes goes in with little to no resistance, about 1 hour. Allow to cool slightly. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over medium-low heat until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain well and place half of the bacon into a bowl. Add the panko, 2 tablespoons chives and 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Mix to combine and set aside. In another bowl, combine the sour cream, butter, heavy cream, the remaining bacon, 1/4 cup Parmesan, 2 tablespoons chives and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Set aside. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle but still warm, cut off the top third of each potato. Remove the skin from the tops. Using a 1 teaspoon measure or a melon baller, scoop out some of the insides of the cooked potatoes, leaving 1/4-inch borders around the edges. This creates little boats. Place the scooped insides and the peeled tops of the potatoes in a medium bowl and mash using a potato masher or the back of a fork. Add the reserved bacon and sour cream mixture. Using a rubber spatula, mix together the filling until well combine. Spoon the filling back into the potato boats until slightly overfilled and mounded on top. Top with a sprinkling of the panko mixture and a drizzle of olive oil. Bake until the filling is heated through and the topping is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.

Taste and add more orange liqueur if you think your margaritas need more sweet oranginess to balance the other flavors. Remember, you&#39;re tasting it warm and undiluted; when chilled and diluted, the flavors will be mellower and the lime&#39;s tartness will be more attractive. Pour several tablespoons of lime juice onto a small plate and several tablespoons coarse salt onto another. Have martini glasses at hand (chill them for an extra special touch). As your guests ask for their margaritas, invert a glass into the plate with the lime juice to moisten rim, then lightly dip into the plate with the salt. For each drink measure 2 ounces (1/4 cup) of the margarita mixture into a cocktail shaker. If you have a 2-ounce ladle that you can keep in the pitcher, measuring goes much faster. Add ice cubes (5 cubes for 1, 8 for 2, 10 for 3). Secure the lid and top and shake vigorously for 10 to 15 seconds.

Line the bottom of two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment and grease the parchment and the sides of the pans with oil. Stir together the cocoa powder and boiling water in a small bowl and let sit to bloom for 5 minutes (this step intensifies the chocolate flavor in the cake). Whisk together the granulated sugar, flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the bloomed cocoa, oil, milk, eggs and vanilla in a medium bowl. Pour the cocoa mixture into the sugar mixture and stir until smooth (the batter will be thin). Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the cakes bounce back when pressed in the middle and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely in the pans on a rack. For the filling and frosting: Heat the cream in a double boiler over low heat, whisking occasionally, until it begins to steam. Whisk in the cocoa powder, chocolate, espresso powder, vanilla and salt until the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the butter until melted. Whisk in the confectioners&#39; sugar until incorporated. Let the frosting cool completely. To assemble: Put 1 cake, bottom-side up, on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread about 1 cup of the frosting over the top but not all the way down the side. Top with the other cake, bottom-side up, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting. For the spider web or mummy decoration: Microwave the marshmallows in a microwave-safe medium bowl until they swell and are soft enough to stir, about 1 minute. Let sit a few minutes until cool enough to touch. Spray your hands with cooking spray. For a spider web, pick up a tablespoon-sized blob of the melted marshmallow and stretch it over and around the cake; repeat so that the strings of marshmallow crisscross one another in many directions, and continue until you have what looks like a spider web. For a mummy, stretch the marshmallow so that all the strings on the top of the cake run in the same direction, leaving a small gap between strings for the mummy&#39;s eyes to peek out. Garnish with a candy spider or several candy spiders for the web cake or candy eyes for the mummy cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 39775,&quot;Red Velvet Whoopie Pies 1 ounce semisweet chocolate, chopped 1/2 ounce milk chocolate, chopped 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup sour cream 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon red food coloring 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise and seeds scraped Instructions: Make the cookies: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Combine the flour, almonds, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger and allspice in a food processor and pulse until the almonds are finely ground. Whisk together the grated carrots, granulated sugar, oil, vanilla and eggs in a large bowl until combined. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes, then remove the cupcakes from the pans to cool completely. For the vanilla American buttercream: Combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer) and beat on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until smooth. Adjust the consistency with milk or cream as desired. Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 3 days. (If refrigerated, allow to come to room temperature and then beat on medium-high speed until smooth before using.) For the chocolate frosting: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa into a large bowl. In another large bowl, combine 1 cup of the sugar mixture with the butter and 1 tablespoon of the milk or cream, beating with an electric mixer until smooth. Add another cup of sugar mixture and another 1 tablespoon milk or cream, beating well. Add the remaining sugar mixture and another 1 tablespoon milk or cream and beat until the frosting is fluffy. Beat in the vanilla. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon milk or cream if needed for desired consistency. For the assembly: Use some red food coloring to tint 1/2 cup of the vanilla American buttercream pink. Scoop the pink buttercream into a pastry bag fitted with a no.6 straight tip. Scoop the remaining white buttercream into a pastry bag fitted with a no.4 straight tip. Scoop the chocolate frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a no.15 fluted tip. (You may use resealable plastic bags in place of pastry bags.) Using the chocolate frosting, create the fur: Pipe around the edge of each cupcake by pulling a dollop of frosting to a point over the edge of the cupcake (this is the same method used to pipe a shell). Layer the frosting as needed to cover any missing spots. Pipe a second circle of fur slightly overlapping the first, covering almost the entire cupcake. Then create the ears: Toward the edge of each cupcake, pipe a triangle shape with the chocolate frosting, layering it so that it is higher than the fur frosting. Fill in the center of the triangle with the pink buttercream. Repeat to make a second ear. Place two candy-coated chocolates in the center of the cupcakes to create eyes. Use the chocolate frosting to fill around the eyes so that they look set into the face. Underneath the eyes, create the cheeks: Pipe two circles with the white buttercream. Pipe a smaller circle underneath and between the cheeks for the mouth. Using the pink buttercream and centering between the cheeks and above the mouth, pipe three dots in a triangle shape to make the nose. Using the frosting of your choice, pipe two lines along the center of the face from the nose, between the eyes and between the ears. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39792,&quot;Vodka Mojito 1 1/2 cups Mint Simple Syrup, recipe follows 1 cup vodka, chilled 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 to 3 large limes) 1 cup club soda, chilled Ice Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish 1 cup sugar 1 cup water 1 packed cup fresh mint leaves Instructions: In a pitcher, combine the Simple Syrup, vodka, lime juice, and club soda.

(This recipe can be made up to a day ahead and reheated over very low heat or in a microwave oven.) &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Garnacha]&quot; 39794,&quot;Haunted Gingerbread House 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup molasses (not blackstrap and preferably golden, mild or sorghum molasses) 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 12 ounces white candy melting wafers 1 cup ready-made chocolate frosting 12 cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed to fine crumbs 2 cups woven corn cereal squares<br> 2 tablespoons cocoa powder 12 ounces black candy melting wafers Candy buttons Black food color marker 3 ounces green candy melting wafers 1/4 cup green sanding sugar Chocolate sprinkles 2 chocolate chews 3 to 4 round gumballs 3 ounces orange candy melting wafers 3 chocolate-filled rolled wafer cookies Black sanding sugar 4 pretzel sticks 3 chocolate snack cake cupcakes 2 mini break-apart chocolate bars Instructions: Make the cookies: Sift 3 cups of flour, the ginger, cinnamon, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Beat the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the brown sugar and molasses. Mix until combined. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix until a thick dough forms. If the dough is sticky, mix in the remaining flour a little at a time until the dough can easily be handled without it sticking to your fingers. You may not have to use all of the flour. Gather the dough into a ball; divide in half. Roll each dough piece flat to 1/4-inch thickness between parchment paper sheets. Transfer the dough inside the sheets to the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Position a rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Print the Haunted Gingerbread House Walls and Roof Template (link below) and cut the shapes out with scissors. When the dough is well chilled, remove it from the refrigerator and peel back the top sheets of parchment. Lay the templates on the dough and cut around them using a flat-edged knife (do not discard the templates). Transfer the dough shapes to the prepared baking sheets. Leftover dough can be re-rolled and cut into cookies, or you can shape it into a baton and store it in your freezer for up to 1 month. Bake the shapes for 15 minutes, or until lightly golden around the edges. While the cookies are still warm, lay the templates on top of the baked cookies and re-cut them using a knife. This will help the shapes fit together perfectly when you are assembling the house. Assemble the house: Place the white candy wafers in a heatproof bowl and cook at 100 percent power in the microwave at 30-second intervals. Stir well after each interval until the candy is smooth (this should take about 1 minute total cook time). Transfer the candy to a disposable piping bag with a small hole in the end snipped (you may also use a zip-top bag with the corner snipped). Use cans from your pantry to help prop the house pieces up as you work. Glue the sides, front and back of the house together using the white melted candy. Let stand until dry, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the landscape: Spread half of the chocolate frosting over a 14-inch cake board or serving platter. Sprinkle the surface with the cookie crumbs and press them down slightly with flattened palms. Save leftover cookie crumbs and frosting for later use. When the candy holding the gingerbread walls together is dry, gently lift the assembled house and place it in the center of the prepared board. Pipe white melted candy along the top edges of the house and attach the roof; hold the pieces steady with your hands until they hold on their own, about 2 minutes. Pipe extra candy around the roof edges and walls to fill in any visible gaps. Place the corn cereal in a bowl or zip-top bag and add the cocoa powder. Mix together until the cereal pieces are well coated with cocoa. Pipe a line of candy on the bottom edge of a roof piece and place cereal pieces end-to-end in a single layer to make roof tiles. Pipe another line of candy just above the first row of cereal and add another row, slightly overlapping the first. It&#39;s okay to use broken cereal pieces, as this will add to the character of the haunted house. Cover the entire rooftop with cereal. Pipe candy on the front and back top edges of the house and line with cereal squares. Allow the house to stand at room temperature until the candy is set, about 15 minutes. Make the windows and door: Print the Haunted Gingerbread House Windows Template (link below). Place the template on a flat work surface and cover it with a large sheet of parchment or waxed paper. Melt the black candy wafers in a heatproof bowl and cook at 100 percent power in the microwave at 30-second intervals. Stir well after each interval until the candy is smooth (this should take about 1 minute total cook time). Transfer the candy to a disposable piping bag with the tip snipped. Pipe the candy over the black boxes (windows and doors) on the template. Use a toothpick to push the candy into small corners and to fill in gaps. Make as many windows as you wish for your haunted house by moving the template under a new sheet of parchment paper. Place candy buttons in each of the smaller windows before the candy is set. Use a food color marker to draw on eyeballs. Allow the candy to stand until set, about 15 minutes at room temperature or 5 minutes in the refrigerator. Peel the candy boxes with eyes off of the parchment and use a little melted candy to attach them to the top front of the house. Position each window tilted inward slightly. Attach the larger candy rectangle below the 2 windows to create the door. Use the white melted candy (reheat if necessary) to pipe dots on the top and bottom edges of the door. Use a toothpick to pull the melted candy into points to create fangs. Make the monster arms: Melt green candy wafers as previously directed with the white and black candy wafers. Transfer the candy to a disposable piping bag with the tip snipped. Lay a sheet of parchment on a work surface. Pipe a 4-inch L shape on the parchment paper with the green candy. Use a toothpick to smooth the candy into an arm shape. Use the toothpick end to pull the bottom of the L shape into fingers. Pour green sanding sugar over the top portion of the arm, leaving the hand uncovered. Place a chocolate sprinkle on each finger to create long claws. Allow the shapes to set until firm. When the candy is firm, peel it off of the parchment and shake the excess sugar off of the arm. Repeat this process with a backwards L shape so that you have 2 monster arms. Attach a candy window with melted candy to each side of the house and hold until set, about 2 minutes. Attach an arm to each window and hold until set. Further decorate the sides and back of the house with more windows.<br> Create boards for the windows: Knead 2 chocolate chews together and roll flat with a rolling pin (if the chews are too firm to flatten, heat them in the microwave for 5 seconds). Cut small board shapes (about 1/4 inch by 1 inch) from the candy using a knife. Use the end of a toothpick to striate the pieces. Use the pointed end of the toothpick to poke 2 small holes in each end, creating nail holes on the boards. Attach the pieces over the windows using melted candy. Make candy pumpkins: Carefully poke holes in the gumballs using a metal skewer or knife, and thread them onto the pointed ends of toothpicks. Melt the orange candy wafers as previously directed. Dip the gumballs into the candy and place them on parchment paper. Remove the toothpick. Use leftover chocolate chews to fashion small pumpkin stems. Place them standing upright on top of the pumpkins. Allow to stand until set, about 15 minutes. Make scary trees: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use the black melted candy (reheat as needed) to pipe 3 well-spaced lines on the cookie sheets. Place a rolled wafer cookie on top of each line. Use the black candy to completely cover the wafers. Draw tree branches with the candy coming off of both sides and the top ends of the wafers. Cover with black sanding sugar. Let stand until firm, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the pretzel ladder: Break 2 of the pretzel sticks in half. Place 2 whole pretzel sticks parallel to each other. Attach the broken pretzel rungs to the whole pretzel sticks using melted candy. Let stand until set. When firm, lean the ladder against the house, preferably leading up to a window with eyeballs peering out. When the trees are firm, lift them from the parchment and shake away excess sugar. Place each snack cake on the cake board upside-down and press a candy tree in its center. Cover the snack cakes with leftover cookie crumbs, if desired. Make tombstones: Place leftover chocolate frosting in a piping bag. Break the chocolate bars at their perforations. Pipe a small dot of frosting onto the crumb-covered cake board and press an upright turned chocolate piece into the frosting. Repeat with remaining chocolate pieces to create a graveyard. Finishing touches: Use melted white candy to pipe spider webs onto the house. Use the food color marker to draw cracks on the house, and spiders near their webs. Place the pumpkin decorations on the landscape and around the house as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>These four wines are a great match for the flavors and textures described in the recipe.

In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, or in a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and warm water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes. If you&#39;re using a mixer, turn the mixer on low, add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and let it go until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 5 minutes. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you&#39;re making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water, if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep the sausages from sticking. Grill the sausages until cooked through, turning with tongs. Set aside. Keep the grill hot to make the pizza. Roll or pat the dough into a rustic, oblong shape, about 1/4-inch thick - do this directly on a lightly floured pizza paddle for ease. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and lay oil side down onto the hot grill. Once the dough looks set, in about 2 minutes, turn the crust over. Now prepare the topping. Cut up the tomatoes and add to a large mixing bowl. Add the garlic and basil. Crumble in the sausage. Rip the mozzarella into pieces with your hands and add that too along with some extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, add the salad mix and toss to combine. Once the crust is set and cooked, transfer it to a platter. Scoop up the salad mix in your hands and spread it evenly over the top. Sprinkle with a good dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 39801,&quot;Stuffed Peppers 4 red, green or yellow bell peppers, tops sliced off and chopped up 2 cups leftover rice or couscous 1 cup leftover chopped or ground sausage, ham, turkey, chicken or beef 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley 1/2 cup chicken stock 2 scallions, chopped Instructions: Slice off tops of bell peppers, remove seeds and discard. Chop up the bell pepper tops and place into a large bowl. Add rice or couscous, chopped meat, dried basil, parsley, chopped pepper tops, chicken stock and scallions.

Using the tip of a small, sharp knife, split the vanilla bean and scrape the insides of the vanilla beans into the milk mixture. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Remove from the heat and set aside for 30 or 40 minutes to allow the vanilla to infuse into the milk. Pour through a fine sieve and strain into bowl and set aside. Preheat griddle to medium heat. In a medium bowl, combine the egg yolks, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and mix together well with a wooden spoon. Little by little add the milk mixture, stirring well with the wooden spoon to blend. Pour mixture through a fine sieve and strain into a clean bowl. Cut bread into 1 to 1 1/2-inch wide strips. Melt 2 tablespoons butter on the griddle. Dip bread sticks into creme brulee mixture. Cook a few at a time for 2 to 4 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown. Add additional butter as needed to keep pan greased. Sprinkle French toast sticks with powdered sugar and serve with syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39803,&quot;Goat Cheese and Red Pepper Frittata 4 tablespoons olive oil 2 shallots, finely chopped 1 small red bell pepper, chopped 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus a pinch<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus a pinch<br> 10 large eggs<br> 3 tablespoons heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br> 4 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled<br> 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley<br> Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Beat the eggs, heavy cream, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Stir in the shallot mixture. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in the nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture and spread the vegetables evenly throughout the pan. As the eggs set, lift the edges to allow the liquid egg mixture to run underneath. Cook until the eggs are mostly set but the center is still a little runny, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle the Parmesan and goat cheese over the top and broil until the top is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully remove the skillet from broiler and loosen the edges of frittata. Cool for 10 minutes in the skillet, then serve slices from the pan or slide onto a serving platter, slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 39804,&quot;Grilled Pizza Quattro Stagioni 1 pound pizza dough, at room temperature 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 cup jarred pizza sauce 1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices and patted dry 3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto cotto<br> 1/2 cup marinated artichoke hearts, well drained 1/2 cup sliced cremini mushrooms (about 1 1/2 ounces)<br> 1/2 cup pitted black olives, drained and roughly chopped 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh basil leaves, optional Instructions: Prepare a gas grill for medium heat or prepare a charcoal grill for medium indirect heat.

Reserve. Coat a large, wide pot with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Sprinkle the boar generously with salt and add to the hot pan. Cook the boar until it is VERY brown on all sides. Remove the boar from the pan and reserve. Ditch the excess oil in the pan. Add a few drops of new oil and add the pureed veggies to the pan. Season them with salt, and brown them until crud forms on the bottom of the pan. Scrape the crud off the bottom of the pan (don&#39;t let the crud burn- it adds A LOT of flavor). Return the browned boar to the pan and add the tomato paste and cocoa powder. Stir to combine and cook the tomato paste for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Toss in the chopped juniper berries. Add the wine and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and let the wine reduce by half. Add water to the pan so it covers the boar by about 1-inch. Toss in the bay leaves and thyme bundle. Taste the liquid and season with salt if needed (it will). Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce to a simmer and let cook for 3 hours, adding water as the liquid level reduces. Taste frequently and re-season as needed. During the last 30 minutes of cooking time, let the cooking liquid reduce and the sauce get thick. Also during the last 30 minutes of cooking, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat to cook the pappardelle. Pasta water should ALWAYS be well salted. Salty as the ocean! TASTE IT! If your pasta water is under seasoned, it doesn&#39;t matter how good your sauce is, your complete dish will always taste under seasoned. When the water is at a rolling boil add the pappardelle and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. While the pasta is cooking, remove 1/2 of the ragu from the pot and reserve. Drain the pasta and add to the pot with the remaining ragu. Stir or toss the pasta to coat with the sauce. Add some of the reserved sauce if needed to make it about an even ratio between pasta and sauce. Add the reserved pasta cooking water and cook the pasta and sauce together over a medium heat until the water has reduced. Turn off the heat and give a generous drizzle of the big fat finishing olive oil. Toss or stir vigorously. Divide the pasta and sauce into serving bowls or one big pasta bowl. Top with grated Parmigiano. Serve immediately. Wine Pairing Suggestion: Chianti Place the flour on a clean, dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, salt and 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water (or more if needed) and salt. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture, be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately, do not refrigerate. To roll the pasta: Cut off 1/3 of the pasta dough, reserve the rest and keep it covered. Squash the pasta with the heels of your hands to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Dust with flour. Put the pasta through the roller set on number one. Roll the dough through 2 times, dusting it with flour if it feels sticky or tacky. Fold the pasta into thirds and put it through the machine on number one again. Change the setting on the pasta roller to number two and run the pasta through. Continue to roll the pasta through the machine, changing the setting each time to a larger number (this will make the opening on the pasta machine smaller). When you get to the desired thin-ness (I recommend number six), cut the pasta into 10-inch lengths. Flour the dough generously and stack them in a pile. Cover the stack with plastic or a clean tea towel and proceed rolling the rest of the pasta. When the pasta is all rolled, take 3 sheets of pasta and fold both ends of the pasta over each other until they meet in the middle. Using a sharp knife, cut the pasta rolls into 1-inch widths. Unroll the pasta \\ribbons\\ and dust with semolina and reserve on sheet trays. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Montepulciano, Dolcetto]&quot; 39810,&quot;Turkey Patty Melt 1 1/4 pounds ground turkey 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta 2 tablespoons minced fresh sage 2 teaspoons soy sauce 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard Salt and freshly cracked black pepper Salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons canola oil 8 slices Swiss cheese 8 slices light rye Caramelized Onions, recipe follows 4 tablespoons salted butter, softened Yellow mustard, for serving 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 large, yellow onions, 1/4-inch slices Salt and freshly cracked black pepper Salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1/4 cup dry sherry 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme Instructions: For the turkey patties: In a large bowl, combine the turkey, ricotta, sage, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon and sprinkle with some salt and pepper.

Combine the flour, butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with some pea-sized pieces. Add the egg and pulse until the dough comes together, about 1 minute. Remove 1/3 cup of the dough and set aside. Press the remaining dough into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch tart pan. Prick the dough all over with a fork.<br> To form the star, start by folding a 40-inch-long-by-2 1/2-inch-wide piece of foil into an accordion (there should be about 24 folds, each 1 1/2-inches long); this will become the support for forming your star inside the tart pan. Let the foil open like an accordion and place it in the tart pan in a circle; connect and overlap the end points so that you have an 11-point star.<br> Roll the reserved 1/3 cup dough into a 27-inch-long rope. Use a rolling pin to flatten the rope into a 34-inch-long-by-1-inch wide strip (if the dough sticks to the surface, use a small offset spatula and quickly run it underneath the strip to loosen it). Carefully transfer the strip to the tart pan and form it around the inside of the foil to create the star shape with the dough (if the dough breaks, just use your fingers and the support wall to form it back together). Once formed, press the bottom of the star shape to adhere firmly to the bottom crust (it will feel like playdough and can easily be molded).<br> Bake until the crust is set and turns a light golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly, about 30 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and discard.<br> Meanwhile, for the lemon curd: Whisk the sugar, lemon juice, eggs, yolk and milk in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until combined. Add the butter a few pieces at a time and whisk continuously until the mixture is thick and coats the back of a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Strain the curd through a sieve if any lumps form. Pour the curd into the center star of the tart.<br> For the blueberry filling: Mix the blueberries, preserves, sugar, flour, lemon zest and lemon juice in a medium bowl until well combined and the berries look glossy. Spoon the mixture around the perimeter of the star where there is no curd.<br> Bake until the curd is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate to cool completely, 4 hours and up to overnight.

Whisk together the flour, baking powder, 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and the salt in a medium bowl. Using a bowl scraper or your fingers, mix in the butter until the mixture resembles a coarse meal (using your fingers will yield a more cake-like texture). Make a well in the center, pour in the milk and stir until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead 5 or 6 times. Roll into a 10-by-14-by-1/4-inch rectangle. Mix together the mascarpone, cinnamon and the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl until well combined. Gently spread the mixture onto the rolled-out biscuit dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle with the raisins and then roll the dough into a long cylinder. Transfer to a baking sheet and freeze for 20 minutes. Set the dough cylinder on a floured work surface and slice into 8 equal pieces. Place cut-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced 1 1/2-inches apart. Use the palm of your hand to gently press the biscuits into 1-inch-thick disks. Bake until the tops start to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. For the caramel: Whisk the cream and the instant tea together in a small bowl until the tea has dissolved (or add to a Mason jar and shake). Without stirring, heat the sugar in a dry pan over medium heat until liquefied and starting to brown, 6 to 10 minutes.

On each sheet, trace a 9-inch circle. Turn paper over so that you can see the tracings. Preheat oven to 225 degrees. Mix together 1 cup sugar, finely chopped nuts, and sifted cornstarch. Place egg whites in bowl of electric mixer. Using the whip attachment, start whipping at slow speed until whites are foamy, add the cream of tartar and salt, continue whipping at fast speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the 3 tablespoons of sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks form. Add the vanilla extract. Remove bowl from mixer stand, fold in the nut mixture by hand, a small amount at a time. Divide mixture between 3 circles and spread into even layers. Bake for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour or until meringues are lightly coloured and dry. Place the 3 meringue layers on work surface, turn 1 layer over to the smooth side (for top layer). Spread a very thin layer of caramel sauce on top layer and chill. Lay 2 remaining meringues on work surface and brush with melted milk chocolate. Chill until set. Remove all layers from refrigerator and place the bottom layer on serving plate, spread 1/2 of the toffee cream over the first layer, place next layer on top and spread the remaining 1/2 of the toffee cream over layer. Place top layer gently on top. Fill a piping bag with a 1/2-inch plain tip and pipe 8 rosettes around the outside border of the layer, leaving space between the rosettes. Fill the spaces with broken pieces of toffee. Drizzle caramel lightly over the whipped cream rosettes. Chill 4 hours before serving. In a small saucepan, scald the cream and set aside. Combine the sugar with 1/2 cup water in a large saucepan. Stir to moisten the sugar. Bring to a simmer, swirling the pan gently to dissolve the sugar. Increase heat and continuing simmering without stirring until syrup begins to color. Once the syrup turns a deep amber or caramel color, remove from heat and add the cream in a steady stream, stirring with a wire whisk. Caramel and cream will bubble up and steam, but keep stirring and continue to whisk until caramel is completely dissolved and combined with the cream. Stir in pieces of butter until melted and combined. Stir in vanilla and salt. Set aside to cool. Coat a cookie sheet with vegetable oil and set aside. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.

Don&#39;t reheat the sauce over direct heat in a saucepan, it will separate. Combine the oregano and the paprika in a small bowl and rub the herb mixture into the Canadian bacon. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the seasoned bacon slices Cook until their edges begin to turn golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Warm the arepas in a large skillet over medium-high heat 10 to 15 seconds on each side until they&#39;re heated through. Fill a large skillet with 1 1/2 inches of water. Add the vinegar and bring the liquid to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium. One at a time, crack the eggs into a ramekin or small bowl and gently slide them into the hot water. Poach the eggs until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Measure out 580 grams (1 1/4 pounds) of the peeled and cubed pieces and transfer to a medium saucepan. (Save any remaining pieces for another use.) Cover with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are soft, 10 to 12 minutes. While the potatoes are boiling, deposit the flour, milk, 1 tablespoon of the oil, yeast, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Drain the potatoes very well, then return them to the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring and breaking up large pieces, until the potatoes are dry and crumbly, about 3 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to the stand mixer bowl and mix on low speed until the dough begins to come together, about 30 seconds. Swap out the paddle for the dough hook and knead on medium speed until somewhat smooth, about 4 minutes. Inspect the dough. If it\\u2019s very sticky, tearing, and smearing around the bottom of the bowl, add 1 tablespoon of flour and mix on low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Keep checking the dough; you may have to add up to 4 tablespoons of flour depending on the moisture level of the potatoes. Return to medium speed and continue kneading until the dough is smooth, another 3 minutes. Transfer to a lightly floured counter and knead by hand for a final minute. If the dough sticks heavily to your hands, work in a bit more flour. The dough should be soft, but not overly tacky. Shape the dough into a ball and move to a tall 2- to 4-quart container or 8-cup liquid measuring cup. Add about 1 teaspoon of oil and rotate the dough in the oil to coat it evenly. Press down to flatten the top of the dough, then mark the dough height on the outside of the bowl with tape or a rubber band. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to rise at room temperature until the dough has doubled in size, 20 to 40 minutes. Once risen, punch down the dough to work out any large gas bubbles. Transfer to a lightly floured counter and divide into eight 175- to 180-gram pieces. Form each into a smooth ball, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a towel and rest for 10 minutes. When 5 minutes remain, heat 1 inch of the oil in a wide Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with a wire rack. (See Cook\\u2019s Note.) One at a time, flatten each dough ball into a circle, then stretch or roll it into an 8- to 10-inch disc. Cut three slits across the center of the disc to help prevent large bubbles from forming during cooking. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and top with a second sheet of parchment. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. When the oil is ready, fry the discs, one at a time, until puffed and golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side. (Although a spider or slotted spoon can be used for flipping, I manage much better with wooden chopsticks.) Transfer the golden-brown beauties to the wire rack as they come out of the oil to drain. Keep an eye on the oil temperature and adjust the heat as needed to maintain 350 degrees F. Continue to stretch out the remaining dough discs while frying. Consume the breads warm, if possible.

Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes over low heat to dissolve the sugar, evaporate the alcohol and let the flavors mingle. Next, pour the contents through a sieve to drain. Repeat a few times and use a paper towel or coffee filter to make the final \\ready for reduction\\ sauce very smooth and silky.<br> When ready to serve, pour about 1 cup sauce into a saute pan over medium-high heat and let reduce or bubble until your desired color and thickness, about 5 minutes. It should be dark crimson in color and coat the back of the spoon. Taste for salt and spice; add more Harissa if you&#39;d like to turn up the heat. Keep warm until ready to plate fish.<br> For the halibut: Halibut is very delicate and will turn into sawdust if overcooked. It only takes a few minutes to cook and is very flaky and juicy when cooked accurately. The longer you let the halibut sit after cooking, the dryer it will become. Have your plates ready for when you start cooking the halibut.<br> Pat the halibut dry and then sprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper. Add the oil to large saute pan over medium-high heat (use anything other than nonstick for a nice golden sear). When the oil is just about to start smoking, lay the fillets gently in the pan as it drops in, falling away from your body, and immediately give the pan a shake. If the pan is hot enough, the fish will not stick. Let the fish cook until brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently flip the fillets over and deglaze with the white wine. Cover and let cook 3 more minutes.<br> To serve, ladle the huckleberry sauce on the plate first, and then put the fish on the sauce; don&#39;t cover up all of the sauce as it shines like a jewel. Place a dollop of Caramelized Shallots on top of the fish. Serve Crispy Oyster Mushrooms alongside; lay the mushrooms on the plate, like a bouquet of flowers with the round part of the mushroom facing up. Place a few of the fresh huckleberries on the plate to garnish. Serve with risotto or rice if desired.<br> Add the garlic to a food processor and pulse until chopped. Add the chipotle peppers, cumin, paprika, mint, oregano and salt. Puree until smooth. Slowly add the olive oil to emulsify. Yield: about 1 1/2 cup. In a small saute pan over low heat, melt the butter and add the salt. Add the shallots and cook until soft and brown, about 20 minutes. Make sure to achieve the brown color, which is the caramelization of the shallots and gives the great flavor. Save on the back burner on low until the fish is finished. Yield: about 1/2 cup. In a small saute pan over medium-low heat, melt the butter and add the salt. Add the mushrooms, reduce the heat to low and cook until the mushrooms turn brown and crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. You can do this at the beginning of your dinner and keep them crispy over low heat. Before plating, add the basil leaves and toss a few times. Doing this just before you plate will help keep the basil leaves bright green.

For the crust: Pulse the cookies, sugar and zest in a food processor until fine. Pulse in the melted butter until the crumbs are moist. Press into a 9-inch pie pan and bake until golden and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. For the filling: Whisk together the sugar and egg yolks in a heavy-bottomed pot until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir in the lemon juice. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and 1/2 cup water and set aside. Cook the lemon mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until just beginning to thicken. Whisk in the cornstarch slurry and cook until it thickens. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Fill the pie crust with the filling, spreading it out evenly. For the meringue: Using a stand or electric hand-held mixer, whisk the egg whites until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and whisk again. Whisk together the sugar and cornstarch in a separate small bowl. With the machine running, add the sugar mixture a little at a time and whisk until the meringue forms stiff peaks.

Spray a 9-inch-diameter springform pan with cooking spray. For the crust: In a food processor, grind the cookies until finely ground. Blend in the sugar and salt. Add the melted butter and process until well blended; it should be the consistency of wet sand. Press the crumbs evenly onto the bottom (not the sides) of the prepared pan. (Or just place the cookie crumb-sugar mixture in the pan, pour the melted butter in and combine.) Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake just until set, about 7 minutes. Allow it to cool while preparing the filling. For the filling: Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until melted, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring every minute until the chocolate is completely melted. In a medium bowl, whisk the sugar and cocoa powder together, smoothing out any lumps of cocoa powder. In a stand mixer, beat the cream cheese until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, and then add the sugar-cocoa powder mixture. Add the orange zest, prepared coffee or espresso powder at this time, if using. Beat until fully incorporated, scraping down the sides and bottom with a rubber scraper when necessary. Blend in the eggs, 1 at a time. Mix in the lukewarm chocolate and stir until combined. Pour the filling over the cooled crust, tap the pan on the table top to remove any air pockets, and then smooth the top to even out. Bake until the center is just set (jiggles like set gelatin) and looks just dry, about 1 hour 10 minutes, rotating halfway. Cool 5 minutes. Run a knife around sides of the cake to loosen, but do not remove from the springform pan. Chill the cake in the refrigerator overnight. For the glaze: Stir the heavy cream, chopped chocolate, honey and prepared coffee in a heavy, medium saucepan over low heat until smooth. Cool slightly. Pour over the center of the cheesecake, spreading to within 1/2-inch of the cheesecake&#39;s edge and filling any cracks. Chill until topping is set, about 1 hour. Transfer the cheesecake to a platter and release from the springform pan. Serve cold, or allow to come to room temperature, about 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 39927,&quot;Prosciutto-Wrapped Halibut with Brussels Sprouts and Kale Couscous Four 4- to 6-ounce halibut fillets Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 slices prosciutto<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> Zest of 1 lemon<br> Pinch cl flakes<br> 2 cups shredded Brussels sprouts<br> 1 cup shredded kale<br> 1 cup whole wheat couscous<br> 1 cup hot chicken stock or water<br> 1/4 cup dried currants or chopped dried cranberries<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle the halibut with salt and pepper. Lay 2 slices of prosciutto on a flat surface, slightly overlapping each other. Place a halibut fillet at the end of the slices and roll up (like a mini burrito). Repeat with the remaining prosciutto and halibut. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the halibut just until the prosciutto gets browned, about 1 minute per side. (If your pan is hot enough, this will happen quickly. This is just for color and crisping the prosciutto; the fish will cook later in the oven!) Transfer the fish to a plate. Quickly stir the garlic, lemon zest and cl flakes into the skillet. Add the Brussels sprouts and kale and saute until tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the couscous, hot stock and currants. Place the fish on top of the mixture and transfer to the oven. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove the fish from the skillet, fluff the couscous with a fork and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 39928,&quot;Filet Mignon over Lobster Boursin Mashed Potatoes with a Merlot Reduction 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 tablespoon (1 to 2 cloves) chopped fresh garlic 2 finely diced shallots, or 1 white onion finely diced Any meat trimmings you may have from the beef (see beef ingredient below) 1/2 (750-ml) bottle Merlot wine 1/2 pint (1 cup) strong beef stock or demi-glace 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme leaves 1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary leaves 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter 4 medium to large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks 2 bay leaves 1 pound lobster meat 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter (to saute lobster) plus 1/2 cup butter (1 stick), for the potatoes Salt and freshly ground white pepper 3 ounces soft herbed cheese (recommended: Boursin) 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives 6 (4-ounce) beef tenderloins (filet mignon) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/8 cup grapeseed oil Instructions: Heat the 3 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan, and saute the garlic and shallots over a gentle heat until translucent. (If you have any trimmings of meat, you would add them at this time). Deglaze the pan with the wine, and add the beef stock and the thyme and rosemary. Allow this mixture to reduce. It could take 20 to 30 minutes (sometimes longer) at a rolling boil, uncovered. You want the liquid to evaporate to about 1/3 of what you started with (in order to intensify the flavor). Once you have reduced the liquid to the required volume, remove from the heat, strain through a chinois (a conical strainer) or some cheesecloth (so you can remove all the vegetables and herbs), return the sauce to the pan and stir in the butter to finish the sauce.<br> For the potatoes: Boil the potatoes with the bay leaves until the potatoes are tender. While the potatoes are cooking, saute lobster meat in oil and butter until it is no longer translucent, and set aside. Drain the potatoes well and discard the bay leaves, then mash the potatoes. Using a beater, add in 1 stick of butter and salt and white pepper. Fold the lobster meat into the potatoes and set aside in a warm place.; Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Season beef with salt and pepper. In a heavy bottomed, oven-safe saute pan, add just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and heat on medium high heat on the stovetop. When the saute pan is hot, cook each side of the filets for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes or so. Turn the filets and continue the searing process on the other side of the filets for another 2 to 3 minutes. Place the pan of steaks into the preheated oven. Allow the filets to cook a further 6 to 8 minutes in the oven (depending on the thickness of the steaks and the heat of your oven). While the steaks are in the oven finish the potatoes by crumbling the Boursin cheese into the lobster mashed potatoes which you have been keeping warm and gently stirring it in to allow cheese to melt. Remove the pan of steaks from oven and allow them to rest. (Remember to use an oven mitt; the handle of the pan will be hot!) If necessary, briefly re-heat the Merlot sauce, then remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the whole stick of butter. Plate a portion of mashed potatoes in the center of serving plate. Top with the filet mignon, spoon the Merlot sauce over and around and garnish with chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Barolo]&quot; 39929,&quot;Lemon Tea Bread 2 extra large eggs Finely grated zest of 1 large lemon 3 tablespoons lemon juice Pinch of salt 1 scant cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup creme fraiche (or sour cream or plain yogurt) 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 lemon, juiced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line with a piece of parchment paper, allowing the sides to hang over the edges of the pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, cardamom, ginger, salt, cloves and nutmeg in a medium bowl until well combined. Whisk together the pumpkin, butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until well combined. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl and stir until completely incorporated. Pour into the prepared loaf pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist crumbs sticking to it and the cake springs back when gently pressed, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool for 30 minutes before unmolding and cooling completely on a wire rack. For the glaze: In the meantime, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, chai tea, cream and cinnamon in a small bowl.

On a floured surface, press out Pizza Dough balls. After dough is pressed out flat, begin stretching by hand to desired size and thickness. Place on baking sheet or preheated pizza stone. Spread San Marzano Crushed Tomato Sauce on the dough, leaving 1/2 inch all the way around free from sauce. Put basil on first (making sure to lay other ingredients over it so basil does not burn in the oven), then prosciutto, onions and cheese. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Bake for at least 10 minutes, or until pizza dough edges look browned and mozzarella has some browned spots. (Best results will be achieved by using a pizza stone that is placed in the oven at least 15 minutes before placing dough on it. Pizza can then be built directly on the pizza stone.) In a small cup, combine 2 tablespoons of the water and the yeast and stir until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside for about 10 minutes. In a mixer with a dough hook, combine the flour and yeast mixture and mix until incorporated. Add the salt and the remaining water. Mix until dough feels and looks smooth. You may have to add a bit more flour or water to achieve this consistency; do this in very small increments, like 1 teaspoon of either flour or water at a time. Let each incorporate and check for desired consistency. When the dough is smooth, and the bowl is free from dry flour, add the oil. Mix until well incorporated. With slightly oiled hands, remove the dough, divide into 2 balls and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest in the fridge anywhere from 2 hours to 4 days. Put tomatoes in a medium bowl with the salt and basil leaves. With an immersion blender, blend until basil is well incorporated and tomatoes are completely crushed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 39937,&quot;Campfire Beans 4 strips bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces 1/2 medium white onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cups pinto beans, soaked overnight, drained Instructions: Heat a cast-iron pot over medium-high heat.

Stir together the granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a small bowl. Let the dough rounds soften at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes, then unroll onto 2 baking sheets. Brush both sides of the dough rounds with the melted butter, and sprinkle the tops with the cinnamon sugar. Bake the dough rounds, rotating the baking sheets halfway through, until they are light golden brown and crunchy, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. While the dough bakes, spread the walnuts out on another baking sheet, and bake until toasted, about 8 minutes. Let cool, then finely chop. Meanwhile, beat 3 cups of the heavy cream, the pumpkin pie puree and 3 tablespoons of the confectioners&#39; sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Put 1 of the baked dough rounds on a cutting board, and center a 9-inch round cake pan on top of it. Use the cake pan as your guide to trim the dough with a knife into a 9-inch circle. Reserve the scraps in a bowl. Repeat with the remaining dough round. Crumble the scraps into bite-sized pieces. Line the cake pan with plastic wrap, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Spread a third of the pumpkin mixture on the bottom of the pan, followed by 1 of the baked dough rounds. Top with half the remaining pumpkin mixture, then the crumbled dough scraps. Finish with the remaining pumpkin mixture and dough round. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 12 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, unwrap the plastic wrap, and invert the cake onto a platter. Remove the cake pan and plastic wrap. Press the chopped walnuts into the sides of the cake. Beat the remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together until soft peaks form; slather the mixture on top of the cake.

Make sure you show this beauty off at the table before you carve it. Garnish your serving platter with fresh herb sprigs and citrus wedges.; Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 475degreesF. Remove giblets and neck from turkey cavities and reserve for making gravy. Place the turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan; pat dry with paper towels. Mix minced herbs, oil, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub the herb mixture all over the turkey, under the skin and onto the breast meat. Place aromatics and 10 of the herb sprigs in the cavity. Tuck the wing tips under the turkey. Tie the legs together with kitchen string. Add 3 cups water and the remaining 10 herb sprigs to the pan. Roast the turkey until the skin is golden brown, 45 minutes. Remove the turkey from the oven. If using a remote digital thermometer, insert it into the deepest part of the thigh, close to the joint. Cover the breast with a double layer of foil, cutting as necessary to conform to the breast. Reduce oven temperature to 350degrees and continue roasting for 11/4 to 13/4 hours more. If the pan dries out, tilt the turkey to let juices run out of the cavity into the pan and add 1 cup water. The turkey is done when the thermometer (or an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh without touching bone) registers 165degreesF. Transfer the turkey to a serving platter and cover with foil. Let the turkey rest for 20 minutes. Remove string and carve.
