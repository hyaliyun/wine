Toast the walnuts on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature. Heat the maple syrup in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When the syrup begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium and allow the syrup to continue to boil and thicken for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a metal spoon. Remove the very hot syrup from the heat. Immediately add the walnuts to the syrup and stir to combine. Transfer the glazed walnuts to a baking sheet with sides. Use a metal spoon to spread the walnuts evenly over one half of the baking sheet. Set aside. Place the sugar and lemon juice in a 3-quart saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar by heating for 10 to 10 1/2 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wire whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it caramelizes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the unsweetened chocolate and stir to dissolve. Immediately and carefully pour the caramelized mixture over the walnuts, covering all the nuts. Allow to harden at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Invert the praline onto a clean, dry cutting board (it should pop right out of the baking sheet), this will keep the shiny side looking shiny after cutting. Use a sharp serrated slicer to cut (use a sawing motion) the praline into desired size pieces. Store the pralines in a tightly sealed plastic container until ready to devour. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Port, Tawny Port, Madeira]</li></ol><p>&quot; 13662,&quot;Crab Cakes 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 1 teaspoon ground ginger powder 1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 1 egg 1 pound lump crab, picked Flour, for dusting 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil, 1 ounce at a time Juice of one lemon Instructions: In a mixing bowl, mix the mayonnaise, panko, seafood seasoning, ground ginger, pepper and egg until thoroughly mixed.

Let the cupcakes cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The cupcakes can be made 1 day ahead and stored at room temperature in an airtight container.) For the frosting: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat, swirling occasionally, until the milk solids have turned golden brown and the butter smells toasty, about 10 minutes. Pour the butter into a shallow baking dish, and refrigerate until it&#39;s solid but still soft enough that your finger leaves an indentation, about 25 minutes. Scrape the cooled butter into a large bowl (be sure not to leave any brown bits in the skillet), and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth. While continuing to beat, add the corn syrup, and beat until incorporated. Scrape down the side of the bowl. Adjust the speed to medium-low, add the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt, and beat until smooth. Use right away or keep for up to 2 hours at room temperature in an airtight container. To assemble: Divide the frosting evenly among the cupcakes, and use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to swirl. Top each cupcake with a teaspoonful of dulce de leche and 1 of the reserved toasted pecans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 13682,&quot;Chicken Stock 3 5-pound roasting chickens 3 large yellow onions, unpeeled, quartered 6 carrots, unpeeled, halved 20 sprigs fresh dill 4 celery stalks with leaves, cut in thirds 4 parsnips, unpeeled, cut in half (optional) 20 sprigs fresh parsley 15 sprigs fresh thyme 1 head garlic, unpeeled, cut in half crosswise 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns Instructions: Place the chickens, onions, carrots, celery, parsnips, parsley, thyme, dill, garlic, and seasonings in a 16- to 20-quart stockpot.

Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Saute the garlic, leeks and shallots until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach and scallions and cover the pot for a few minutes until spinach has wilted significantly. Uncover and simmer on medium-low heat to allow the liquids to evaporate (be sure not to let spinach mixture to burn). When the majority of the liquids have evaporated, transfer to a large bowl. Mix the feta, ricotta, kefalotiri, dill, mint, pepper, nutmeg and eggs in a large bowl. Gently fold the cheese mixture into the cooled spinach mixture. Brush a 15-by-10-inch rectangular pan with olive oil. Gently place one sheet of number-10 phyllo in the bottom of the pan and brush with olive oil, making sure to coat well. Repeat this step eight times. This creates a nice strong base for serving. Pour in the spinach filling. Use the entire box of number-7 phyllo on top of the spinach, making sure to coat each layer of dough very well with olive oil. Also make sure to tuck in edges of the phyllo around the pan to make it look pretty. Score the pie in appropriate portion sizes. Brush the top with the beaten eggs; this gives it the beautiful golden brown color that is achieved after approximately 1 hour of baking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 13710,&quot;Redder Than Red Cranberry Sauce 1 (12-ounce) bag fresh cranberries 7 ounces caster sugar 3 tablespoons cherry brandy 4 fluid ounces water Lemon juice, optional Instructions: Place all the ingredients in a pan and cook until the liquids have reduced to a thick cranberry sauce. The pectin-rich nature of the fruit means that it solidifies briskly as it cools, so take the pan off the heat to stop it from cooking and reducing when you still think there&#39;s too much liquid. Once the berries have burst, which should be after about 10 minutes, it should be ready. Taste to test whether the sauce needs more sugar (if you find it too sweet just add some lemon juice). &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Pinot Noir, Merlot]&quot; 13711,&quot;The Sergeant Pepper 2 tablespoons butter 1 head cauliflower, cut in small pieces Salt and pepper 1/2 cup flour 1/2 cup rice flour 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 cup cold seltzer water (club soda) Vegetable oil for frying 2 yellow onions, thinly sliced 8 slices sourdough bread 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 4 slices Wisconsin Pepper Jack cheese 4 slices Wisconsin Cheddar cheese Instructions: Heat large saut pan over high heat.

Add the sugar, mustard seeds and coriander seeds. Simmer until the liquid reduces to a syrup consistency and the seeds become tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Heat the oil in the same pan over medium heat until it smokes lightly. Add the onions and red pepper and cook over high heat until slightly tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt. Remove from the heat and add to the reduced vinegar mixture along with the hot sauce and pickles. Stir to blend, then transfer to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 48 hours. For the crispy onions: Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a medium pot. Stir together the flour and paprika in a medium bowl, then add the onion slices and toss to coat. Test the oil by dropping in one onion slice. It should fall to the bottom, begin to bubble, rise to the top and fry gradually. Prepare a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel, and get a slotted spoon ready. Shake the excess flour off half of the onions and drop them in the oil. Gently swirl them with the spoon so they fry more evenly on all sides, until they are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove them with the spoon and lay them out on the kitchen towel to cool. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining onions. For the hot dogs: Boil or pan-fry? Your choice. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) If you want to boil the dogs, place the dogs in a pan with enough simmering water to cover them and gently cook over medium-low heat until fully hot, 8 to 10 minutes. To pan-fry, add them to a little hot oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat until they are golden brown on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Toast the buns in the toaster or a hot (350 degree F) oven until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread a layer of mustard down the length of the dogs and place them in the buns. Top with hearty helpings of the relish and even layers of the onions all the way down the bun. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 13738,&quot;Shredded Beet and Carrot Salad Juice of 1 lemon Juice of 1 orange<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 large carrots<br> 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and quartered<br> 1 large jarred pickled red beet, sliced into matchsticks<br> Instructions: Whisk the lemon juice, orange juice, olive oil and some salt and pepper together in a large bowl.

Place the ricotta into the bowl of a mixer and beat with the paddle attachment until the curds smooth out. Mix the drained and beaten ricotta with 1 cup powdered sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, chocolate chips and half the candied fruit. Set aside. Lightly oil a 10-inch springform pan with canola oil. Slice the sponge cake very thinly so that the springform may be lined with it in an even layer. Line the sides and bottom of the pan with the sponge cake. Pour the ricotta filling into the cake-lined pan. Place a final layer of cake over the ricotta filling; this now creates the bottom to the cassata. Before serving, the cassata will be inverted onto this cake bottom. Refrigerate the cassata overnight to firm the filling. Invert the springform pan on a wide platter. Open the hinge and remove the springform sides and bottom.

Place the bread in 2 shallow baking dishes in a single layer. Pour the egg mixture over the bread; let soak for 10 minutes. While the bread is soaking, preheat a grill to medium. Place a flat cast-iron skillet on the grill. Brush the bananas with the melted butter; cook in the skillet until they are browned on all sides and beginning to release their juices, about 3 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer the bananas to a plate, then wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel. When the bananas are cool enough to handle, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Remove a piece of bread from the egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off. Place on a cutting board, top with four or five banana slices, then cover with another piece of bread. Brush the skillet on the grill lightly with vegetable oil. Add the sandwich to the pan; place a grill press or heavy pan over the sandwich to weigh it down. Cook until the bread is nicely toasted and golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, press and cook on the other side until golden. Keep warm; repeat with the remaining bread and bananas, adding more oil as needed. Transfer the panini to plates and slice in half diagonally; top with confectioners&#39; sugar and plenty of maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 13749,&quot;Florentine Scallop Scampi with Fettuccine 1/2 stick unsalted butter, (4 tablespoons) 5 cloves garlic, minced Juice of 2 lemons (1/3 cup) 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound sea scallops, tough muscles on the side removed 12 ounces fresh fettuccine 2 cups baby spinach 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped Instructions:</p><ol><li>Position a rack closest to the broiler and preheat to high.

Lightly grease and flour a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and set aside. In the bowl of a mixer, beat the egg whites on low speed until soft peaks form. Add the sugar gradually with the mixer running and peak to stiff peaks. Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after the addition of each. Sift together the flour and baking powder and add to the egg mixture, alternating with the milk. (Do this quickly so the batter does not lose volume.) Add the vanilla. Bake until golden, 25 minutes. To make the cream topping: In a blender, combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream and blend on high speed. Remove the cake from the oven and while still warm, pour the cream mixture over it. Let sit and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight. To make the icing: Once the cake is completely chilled, in a saucepan combine the water and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Cook until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, 235 to 240 degrees F. Remove from the heat. In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. While beating, add the hot syrup in a stream. Beat until all the syrup has been added, the mixture cools, and a glossy icing forms. To assemble: Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the icing evenly across the top. Arrange the mango and papaya slices over the top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 13757,&quot;Tablescape Centerpiece: Fortune Bush 4 (3-ounce) boxes fortune cookies 2 (12-ounce) bags white chocolate chips 4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons meringue powder 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/3 to 3/4 cup warm water<br> Instructions: Line 2 sheet pans with wax paper, unwrap all the fortune cookies, and pour the sanding sugar into a shallow bowl. In a glass bowl in the microwave, melt 1 bag of white chocolate chips in 30 second intervals, being sure to stir the chocolate frequently. When completely melted, dip half of the fortune cookies from the pointed end and the other half from the rounded end. Dip in the bowl with purple sanding sugar while still wet. Place on the wax paper-lined sheet pans and allow to set up. To make the royal icing, beat together the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder with the lemon juice. Slowly add in the water until smooth and thick (the icing should not be runny). To assemble, cover the styrofoam cone with craft paper, using tape to secure. Start on the bottom row with the cookies dipped from the rounded end. Put a dollop of royal icing on the back of a cookie and press gently against the cone. Hold for a few seconds. Repeat around the base. Allow icing to set 5 minutes before continuing to the next row. (To help secure each cookie you can also use toothpicks inserted into the cone through the fold in the middle of each cookie.) Using cookies dipped from the pointed end, adhere around the cone above the first row in the same manner. Repeat, alternating rows between cookies dipped on the rounded and pointed ends, allowing each row to set for 20 minutes in between. Don&#39;t worry if they don&#39;t line up perfectly, the spaces will be covered later with ribbon. When complete, stick 2 cookies together with icing and place on the very top. Allow to dry for a few hours. To finish, using purple satin ribbon, start at the top and make loops by securing into the empty spaces with the pearl-topped pins. Scatter the violets throughout, securing to the cone in the same manner.

Use the olive oil to smear a patch in the center of the foil, large enough to hold the chicken. Make a bed of the tomato slices, in the center, then top with the chicken breasts, salt and pepper to taste, the Parmesan, and thyme leaves. Add the olives and thyme sprigs. Fold the foil over the chicken onto itself and crimp the edges as tightly as possible by making 1- or 2-inch folds, one after the other, each sealing the other. Seal the package very tightly, but leave plenty of room around the chicken. (You can prepare the recipe up to 3 hours in advance to this point; refrigerate the package.) Place a skillet large enough to hold the package over high heat. A minute later, add the remaining oil, then pour out all but a film. Put the package in the skillet; it will sizzle. About 2 minutes later, the package will expand like a balloon; be careful of the escaping steam. Cook for 5 minutes longer from that point. Remove the package from the heat, again taking care to avoid any escaping steam. Let rest for 1 minute, then cut a slit down the length of the top with a knife.

Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. For the garlic butter: Place the garlic in a small saute pan and set over medium heat. Add the butter and warm through. Cook the garlic until fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Then place the garlic butter in the fridge to firm up again. For the blistered cl: Toss the poblano with olive oil to coat. Place the pepper under the broiler or char on the grill over a direct flame until the skin blisters. When done, remove the seeds, stem and roughly chop. Reserve. For the onions and peppers: Set a large saute pan over high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and saute the onions and bell peppers until wilted, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with the paprika and some salt and pepper. For the turkey burgers: In a large mixing bowl, combine the turkey, mustard, Worcestershire, cumin, white pepper and the reserved blistered cl.

Push the veggies into the meat until everything is mixed well. All of the veggies should bind together with the meat. If you have any loose veggies hanging out keep mixing and binding. Set aside until ready to build pasties. For the crust: In a separate large mixing bowl, add the flour and salt. Combine together, and then add the 2 types of shortening. Break up the shortening while working it in with the flour. You want to have small, pea size pieces of shortening and flour combined yet not over mixed. In a separate bowl, blend the eggs, water, and vinegar. Add to the flour and mix and fold the contents together, gently pushing the flour and liquid mixture until they are together in a large dough consistency. Pick up the mix and continue to turn it over on top of the liquid and just push it down into the liquid not to over mix the dough. Cover the dough and chill it before rolling. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Take a portion of the dough and lay on a floured counter. Roll out the dough to no more than 1/4- inch thickness. Roll out as big of a sheet as you are comfortable with; we use an 8-inch plate and cut out crusts for each pastie. After cutting the crust, work the scraps back into the next sheets. Do this as many times as it takes to use up all the dough. With a consistent thickness you should get about 25 crusts. Once you have your crusts rolled out you can begin filling. Lay out your crusts and egg wash half of the inside crust. Lay 1 cup of filling in the center of each crust. Fold in half gently, careful not to tear the dough. After folding, use a fork to crimp the crusts. Place pasties on a lined baking sheet, poke fork holes on top to create air pockets, egg wash the top, and place in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and an internal temperature is reached of 160 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 13774,&quot;Flambe Oranges and Cream 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon minced ginger 2 oranges, zested and juiced, reserve some zest for garnish, plus 4 oranges peeled and segmented 1 star anise 8 crepes, folded into triangles 1/4 cup orange liqueur (recommend: Grand Marnier) 1 pint best-quality vanilla ice cream Instructions: In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add butter and melt.

Pour 2 inches of oil into a large high-sided skillet or a Dutch oven and set over medium heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F. While the oil is heating, dredge the tofu. Remove one piece from the brine and toss in the flour mixture to coat, shaking off the excess. Dip in the Dijon mixture, making sure all sides are coated, then dredge in the flour again, pressing to adhere the flour. Transfer the coated tofu to a plate while coating the rest. Add all four pieces of tofu to the hot oil, leaving space between each piece. (Fry in batches if the skillet is getting crowded.) Fry until the coating is a deep golden brown, flipping the tofu halfway, about 5 minutes. Transfer the fried tofu to paper towels or a baking sheet lined with a wire rack to drain. Spread some Vegan Buffalo Mayo on the burger buns, add a piece of tofu to each and layer with some lettuce and dill pickles. Add the tofu, hot sauce, Dijon, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon salt to a blender or food processor. Blend on high, stopping to scrape the sides as needed, until the mixture is smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a pint jar or airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 13835,&quot;Shrimp and Oyster Gumbo with Okra 1 1/2 pounds jumbo shrimp, with heads and shells 1 blue crab 1 onion, halved 2 bay leaves 5 sprigs fresh thyme 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 2 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning 2 lemons, halved and squeezed 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 yellow onions, chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 1 green bell pepper, chopped 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 pound okra, cut into 1/4-inch slices 1 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning 1 (15-ounce) can chopped tomatoes, drained 3 bay leaves 3 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves striped from the stem 2 quarts Shrimp Stock 1 1/2 pounds reserved peeled shrimp 1 pint raw, shucked oysters (about 20 pounds unshucked) 3 cups cooked long-grain white rice Chopped flat-leaf parsley and green onions, for garnish Crusty French bread Fire Water, recipe follows Instructions: To make the shrimp stock: Peel the shrimp, and toss the heads and shells into a large stock pot; refrigerate the peeled shrimp until ready to cook in the gumbo. Add the crab, onion, bay leaves, thyme, cayenne, Old Bay, and lemons to the pot. Cover with 2 1/2 quarts of cold water. Allow the liquid to slowly come to a boil, and then lower the heat. Gently simmer for 45 minutes, uncovered, skimming any foam that rises to the top. Strain the stock into a heatproof container or another pot to remove the chunky solids; at this point you should have about 2 quarts of flavorful broth to use in the gumbo. Cool until needed. To make the gumbo, you must start with a roux base: Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot. Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps - it may lock-up like cake frosting but just keep stirring through it. Cook the roux until it&#39;s the color of a walnut and smells equally as nutty, this should take about 15 minutes. Add the onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic, and okra (if it ain&#39;t got okra, it ain&#39;t gumbo!); season with salt, cayenne, and Old Bay. Mix in the tomatoes, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring now and then, until the vegetables are soft. Pour in the cooled shrimp stock and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then reduce the heat. Simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gumbo is dark and thick. Toss in the shrimp and oysters, cook about another 15 minutes; adjust seasoning. To serve: Ladle the gumbo into shallow bowls and pile some rice in the center. Sprinkle the parsley and green onions over the top. Pass the French bread and hot sauce at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 13836,&quot;Flash Fried Oysters \\In Tuxedo\\ with Black and White Truffles 1/2 gallon peanut oil 8 ounces yellow cornmeal Salt and pepper 1-ounce cayenne 1-ounce paprika 24 oysters, shucked 1 tomato 1/2 bunch watercress, trimmed and cleaned 3 ounces favorite vinaigrette 4 slices pullman loaf bread Truffle mayonnaise, recipe follows 1 small black truffle, very thinly sliced 1-ounce white truffle oil 2 ounces black truffle ends and pieces 6 egg yolks 1-ounce white wine vinegar 5 ounces canola oil 2 ounces truffle oil Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat the oil in a large deep pot to 325 degrees F.

Season generously with salt and pepper. In a large heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over medium/high heat. Brown the chicken pieces evenly on all sides, then transfer to a covered heatproof casserole. Add the onions and carrots to the hot skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until golden. Transfer them to the casserole with the chicken. Place the potatoes around the edges of the casserole and again season with salt and pepper. Add the bay leaf. Pour off most of the fat from the skillet and, over high heat, deglaze it with the white wine. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom and sides of the pan to release all the flavorful bits into the liquid, for about 3 minutes. Pour the wine over the chicken, add the stock and bring up to the boil. Reduce the heat to very low, cover and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, until the chicken thighs test done. Check the pan occasionally to make sure the liquid is kept at a slow simmer. If it boils the chicken will be tough. Transfer the chicken and vegetables to a platter with a slotted spoon and discard the bay leaf. To make the picada: combine the almonds and garlic in a food processor and process them to a fine paste. Add the saffron and the hardboiled egg yolks only, process again and add enough of the liquid from the casserole to make a smooth paste. Return the casserole to mediumhigh heat and whisk the picada into the cooking liquid. Simmer until the sauce is reduced to about 3 cups, and taste for seasoning. Return the chicken and vegetables to the pan and turn to coat them with the sauce and heat through. Serve in the pan, sprinkled with the egg whites. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 13839,&quot;Grilled Shrimp with Spicy Veg Noodles 6 tablespoons fish sauce 1/4 cup lime juice (from 2 limes)<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 jalapeno or serrano, thinly sliced<br> 1 pound (16-20) shrimp, peeled and deveined, tail on if desired<br> 3 large carrots, cut into spiral noodles<br> 3 mini cucumbers, cut into thin half-moons<br> 2 zucchinis, cut into spiral noodles<br> 1 medium beet, peeled and cut into spiral noodles<br> 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, torn<br> 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves<br> 3 scallions, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 cup roasted salted peanuts, chopped<br> Instructions: In a measuring cup, combine the fish sauce, lime juice, oil and vinegar and whisk together.

Stir and set aside. For the all-butter lemon pie crust: Combine the flour, salt and lemon zest in a large bowl. Add the butter and use a pastry cutter to gradually work it into the flour, until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. This step should take 3 or 4 minutes. Lightly beat the egg with a fork in a small bowl, then add it to the mixture. Next, add the cold water and vinegar and stir together until just combined. Divide the dough into 2 halves, form the halves into dough balls and place each ball into a resealable plastic bag. Using a rolling pin, slightly flatten each ball of dough (to about 1/2 inch thick) to make rolling easier later. Seal the bags and chill for at least 20 minutes (or freeze if not using immediately). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking sheet with parchment, overhanging the parchment 3 inches on opposite sides of the baking sheet to resemble a sling (so you can lift the pie out). With a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface, begin rolling each piece of dough into a 9-by-13-inch rectangle. Roll the dough from the center outward. Be gentle and patient; it&#39;ll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out. Place one rectangle in the bottom of the prepared baking sheet. Spread out the fruit mixture evenly on top. Place the second crust on top of the fruit. Press and fold the edges together and crimp. Cut several vents in the top of the pastry in a flower pattern. Bake until the crust is golden brown, about 1 hour 10 minutes.

For the veal: To pound the veal chops, line a cutting board with plastic wrap and place a chop on top. Place another piece of plastic wrap over the chop making sure it&#39;s completely covered. Use a meat mallet to pound the veal evenly, making sure the middle and the edges are the same size, about 1/2 inch in thickness. Remove plastic from the top and set the pounded chop aside; repeat with the rest of the chops. Set up 3 shallow baking dishes, one with the flour, one with the beaten eggs, and the third with the breadcrumbs, parsley and Parmesan. Season the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs generously with salt and pepper. Season each veal chop with salt and pepper on both sides. Dredge a chop in the flour. Shake off any excess flour and then dip it into the egg mixture and then into the breadcrumbs. Once the chop is in the breadcrumbs, use your hand to scoop the crumbs up and over the meat and press to make sure it adheres and evenly coats the chop. Repeat the breading procedure with the remaining chops. Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat and add 1/4 cup blended oil. When the oil is hot, add two of the breaded chops to the pan. Cook for 3 minutes or until golden brown, then turn the chops gently with tongs and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes on the other side. Lower the heat and add 2 tablespoons of butter. When the butter is almost brown, drizzle the juice of 1 lemon into the pan and over the crisp veal. Remove the chops and place them on a sheet pan. Drizzle the pan drippings over the veal. Repeat with the remaining 1/4 cup oil, remaining veal chops, remaining 2 tablespoons butter and remaining lemon juice. For the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, garlic and vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the salad: In a medium bowl, combine the fennel, radishes, olives and tomatoes. Toss with a few spoonfuls of vinaigrette. Add the arugula just before serving and toss again. To serve: Place a veal chop on a serving plate and add some salad on top. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and some Parmesan shavings.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the onions are tender. Remove from oven and toss with 2 more tablespoons balsamic vinegar and cool to room temperature. Whisk together the shallots, mustard, red wine vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. While whisking, add 3/4 cup olive oil until emulsified. To assemble, toss enough lettuce for 6 people with dressing, to taste. Place the lettuce on 6 plates and arrange the onions on top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 13909,&quot;Caramel Pecan Sundaes 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 1/4 cups heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 pints vanilla ice cream 2 pints butter pecan ice cream Toasted pecans Instructions: For the caramel, mix 1/3 cup water and the sugar in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook, without stirring, over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium and boil uncovered until the sugar turns a warm chestnut brown (about 350 degrees on a candy thermometer), 5 to 7 minutes, gently swirling the pan to stir the mixture. Be careful; the mixture is extremely hot! Watch the mixture constantly at the end, as it will go from caramel to burnt very quickly. Turn off the heat. Stand back to avoid splattering and slowly add the cream and vanilla. The cream will bubble violently and the caramel will solidify; don&#39;t worry. Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits. To assemble the sundaes, place one scoop of vanilla ice cream and one scoop of butter pecan ice cream in each dish and sprinkle with toasted pecans. Drizzle with caramel sauce and serve extra sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Port]</li></ol><p>&quot; 13910,&quot;Grilled T-Bones with Chipotle Chili Rub and Cilantro-Lime Compound Butter 2 sticks butter 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves 1 lime, juiced and zested 2 tablespoons steak seasoning blend for the grill (recommended: Montreal Seasoning by McCormick) 1 tablespoon chipotle (smoky) ground chili powder or dark chili powder 1 tablespoon sweet paprika 4 T-bone steaks, 1 1/2 inch thick Instructions: Preheat a two-burner grill pan over high heat or a table-top electric grill to high or preheat the outdoor grill. Cut butter into chunks. Place butter in a bowl. Place bowl in microwave and cook on high for 15 seconds. To chop herbs super-fine, hold the tip of your knife on a cutting board and move the back of your knife up and down very fast going over the herbs again and again. Stir in chopped cilantro and lime zest and juice into the butter using a rubber spatula. Transfer the butter onto a large strip of plastic wrap. Gather the ends of the plastic wrap in on 1 hand and use a straight edge, like a small cookie sheet pan, to push the butter back and away from your body making the butter take on a log shape. Gently roll the log wrapped in plastic back and forth on the countertop to evenly round out the shape. Twist up the extra wrap on the ends and place the compound butter log into the freezer to make the butter cold enough to slice again. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and unwrap. Combine the steak seasoning blend with hot chipotle pepper and sweet paprika. A tablespoon is about a palm full of powdered or ground seasonings. Rub the seasoning blend into the steaks, distributing the spices evenly among them. Go wash up. Using tongs, place steaks on screaming-hot grill, carefully place the thin tip of 1 steak facing the wide end of the next so that all 4 steaks fit onto the grill pan or grill grate at the same time. Cook steaks 6 to 7 minutes on each side for medium doneness. Remove steaks and let them rest so that the juices can redistribute, 5 minutes. When ready to serve, top steaks with disks of sliced compound butter and serve with salad or vegetables on the side. The smashed cheesy potatoes and sauteed sliced vegetables make especially tasty side dishes for these steaks. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 13911,&quot;Grilled Mahi-Mahi Sandwiches 1 large red onion 1 tablespoon pickling spice<br> 1 cup white vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons paprika<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 mahi-mahi fillets, thawed if frozen<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the grill grates<br> 4 ciabatta rolls 1 cup baby arugula<br> Instructions: For the pickled red onions: Thinly slice the red onion, then pack into a 16-ounce mason jar.

Whisk together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add the butter, 1 cup of the granulated sugar, brown sugar and egg to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer). Beat on medium speed just to combine, about 30 seconds. Add the flour mixture in 2 parts and beat on low until just combined. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Whisk together the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Form the dough into 1 1/4-inch balls (about 1 tablespoon dough per cookie). Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar and coat well; arrange on two baking sheets, 2 inches apart. Do not flatten the balls, as they will spread a lot in the oven. Bake one sheet of cookies at a time until the tops look cracked and the center still feels soft, about 9 minutes. Let the cookies cool in the pan for 3 minutes; they will continue cooking during this time. Once they&#39;ve firmed up a little, transfer them to a rack to continue cooling.

In a large casserole heat the oil over medium-high heat. Season the meat with salt and pepper and brown on all sides. Remove the short ribs and set aside. Add the onion, carrot, paprika, caraway, and thyme to the pan and cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Pour in the honey, red wine, and stock and bring it to a boil. Return the meat to the pan; the liquid should just about cover the meat. Place the pot in the oven and put on the lid loosely to allow the steam to escape and the sauce to thicken. Cook until the meat is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Place the meat on a platter and keep it warm. If necessary, cook the liquid over high heat until it is thick and syrupy. Remove from the heat and return the meat to the pan while you make the scallops. For the scallops: In a saucepan over high heat, add the chicken broth, cream, orange zest, and saffron, if using. Cook until the liquid is reduced and thick, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, pat the scallops dry with paper towels. Season them well with salt and pepper. Put a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 3 tablespoons olive oil. Sear the scallops without moving them for 1 to 2 minutes. When nicely browned, turn them over and sear them on the other side. Remove the scallops and set aside. Pour out any excess oil and add the cream mixture to the pan. Let this reduce over high heat for about 2 minutes. Return the scallops to the pan and cook until they are heated through, about 1 more minute.

While stone is heating, brush olive oil evenly over shell and bake 5 to 7 minutes or until oil bubbles. (If using thin crust pizza, you can eliminate pre-baking of the pizza crust.) While shell bakes begin cooking the mushrooms. Heat saute or fry pan on high heat, add the oil, garlic and shallots and quickly saute for approximately 30 seconds. Do not allow the garlic/shallot mixture to burn. Add mushrooms to hot pan, saute quickly until most of the mushroom juices have evaporated (3 to 5 minutes), then add wine. Continue to saute until wine completely evaporates and mushrooms have turned a darker shade or brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove mushroom mixture from heat. Remove shell from oven (leave stone in oven to keep it hot) and allow to cool slightly. Spread the gorgonzola cheese evenly over the warm crust so that it melts slightly. You can dip your fingers in olive oil to spread the gorgonzola. Spread the mushroom mixture evenly over the crust. Add the Fontina cheese, distributing it as evenly as possible. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place on hot stone in oven and bake 12 to 15 minutes or until cheese is lightly browned and bubbly. Cool and cut into small rectangles for hors d&#39;oeuvres or into pie-shaped pieces for first course or main course portions. Serve warm or at room temperature. This recipe can be adjusted to suit personal taste such as adding dried, red hot pepper or use different cheeses; however you should not eliminate the gorgonzola.

Place ribs in a sealable container and pour the sauce over, turning to coat the meat with the sauce. Refrigerate and marinate at least an hour, or up to 24 hours. On the SolaReflex 900, use a low black 3 quart pan with a clear glass lid that has a removable knob. You can also use a toaster oven size grill with drip pan inside our optional Clear box oven. Always wear sunglasses when solar cooking. Consider the focal point hot spot the same as an open flame, so use the same common sense and caution. When in direct alignment with the sun, it will reach over 900 degrees F, but normal cooking temps with the diffused hot spot directed on your pan will heat in the 350 to 500 degree F range, depending on sun angle and sky conditions. Center the cooking container on the support stand, then standing behind your cooking reflector, turn the SolaReflex 900 towards the sun and direct the reflected bright hot spot down to the support stand and center it on right 2/3 of the meat. The hot spot will track right to left as sun moves, so realign the 900 to the same starting position in 25 to 30 minutes, or when the hot spot falls on the left 2/3&#39;s of your meat. Reduce heating levels by moving the pot closer to the reflector, which makes a larger hot spot. The smaller the hot spot, the higher the heat level. Push a probe thermometer through the hole left by the vacant knob, into the bottom of the thickest part of the meat. Normal cooking time on sunny days will be about 45 to 60 minutes. Bright sunny days provide the fastest cooking between 9 am and 2 pm. Partial clouds will slow cooking times and lower temps, so confirm doneness with a meat thermometer. If the meat starts browning too much on top, open the lid and turn the meat only once to brown the other side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 13930,&quot;Vanilla Genoise 6 large eggs, separated 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup hot water 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted 1 cup all-purpose flour Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In the food processor (or, alternatively, in a bowl), blend the flour, sugar and salt. Add the butter and pulse to blend (or mix in with your fingers) until the mixture is crumbly. Add the yolk, blend it in. If the dough does not hold together when pressed between 2 fingers, add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it does. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured flat surface. Knead the dough until smooth, flatten it and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate. Put the mangoes on a flat surface and, one by one, hold the mangoes upright and cut one slice off each \\side. It&#39;s like quartering apples only you are avoiding the large pit in the center of each mango. Make each slice as deep as you can to extract the maximum flesh from each mango. Slice the smaller piece off the top and bottom of each fruit as well. In a skillet over low heat, melt the sugar until it becomes golden brown. Add the butter (it will bubble up). Remove the skillet from the heat and pour equal amounts of the caramelized sugar mixture into each ramekin. Divide the mango pieces among the ramekins and press the fruit into the caramel sauce. Roll the dough on a floured surface (or, alternatively, between 2 pieces of waxed paper) and cut out circles that fit the tops of the ramekins. Tuck the dough edges inside the ramekins so it covers the fruit. It is as if you are tucking the fruit into a pastry bed. Place the ramekins on a sheet pan and into the center of the oven and bake until the pastry browns, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Unmolding: Don&#39;t be afraid of failure. A tarte tatin is nice when imperfect! Place a plate over the pastry topping and flip the tart on to the plate. You can do it! Pour the reserved caramel back over the tart. If any fruit remains in the bottom of the skillet, simply dislodge it and insert it any fruit gaps before serving. Serve warm with ice cream or a dollop of sour cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 13948,&quot;Torta di Pasta 8 ounces spaghetti 1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped 4 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup grated Parmesan 3/4 cup grated fontina 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. All these ingredients can be made in advance. Be sure they&#39;re room temperature when you assemble the salad. If you&#39;re nervous about raw egg yolks, substitue 2 tablespoons of real mayonnaise. Pancetta is Italian bacon. You can find it in your Italian grocery or a specialty food store.

Pile the ricotta in a large (12-inch) round shallow bowl or oval platter. Using a slotted spoon, place the tomatoes around the ricotta, discarding any liquid. Drizzle the tomatoes and ricotta with olive oil, sprinkle with the reserved basil and fleur de sel, and serve at room temperature. Set a fine-mesh sieve over a deep bowl. Dampen 2 pieces of cheesecloth with water and line the sieve with a double layer of the cheesecloth. Pour the milk and cream into a medium stainless-steel or enameled pot, such as Le Creuset, and stir in the salt. Bring to a full rolling boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and pour in the vinegar. Allow the mixture to stand for one minute, until it curdles. It will separate into thick parts (the curds) and milky parts (the whey). Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl at room temperature for 20 minutes (for soft ricotta) to 25 minutes (for firmer ricotta), occasionally discarding the liquid that collects in the bowl. Transfer the ricotta to a bowl, discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining liquid. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The ricotta will keep, refrigerated, for 4 to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 13997,&quot;Steak Pizzaiola 1 1/4 pounds boneless sirloin steak (about 1 inch thick), excess fat trimmed Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, smashed 1 large onion, sliced 1/4 inch thick 2 bell peppers (1 red, 1 yellow), sliced 1/2 inch thick 4 jarred pepperoncini, drained and thinly sliced 1 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch of red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Focaccia, for serving (optional) Instructions: Sprinkle the steak all over with 1/4 teaspoon salt.

Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Cook the oil, tomato paste, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring, until the oil turns yellow, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes. Rinse the can with about 1 1/2 cups water, and add the tomato water and basil to the skillet. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the sauce thickens, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, put the almond flour in a medium bowl. Whisk the eggs and 3 tablespoons water in another medium bowl until frothy. Lay out the eggplant on a clean surface, and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Dip the eggplant in the egg, press into the almond flour to coat, then place on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the eggplant is tender and the crust is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets if the top one is browning too quickly. Turn the oven to broil. Spread a little of the sauce on the bottom of a broiler-safe 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange half the eggplant in the dish in as close to an even layer as you can without overlapping too much. Spread half the remaining sauce on top, then 1/4 cup of the mozzarella. Top with the remaining eggplant, sauce and mozzarella and the Parmesan. Broil until the cheese is melted and browned, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the parsley over the top, and serve immediately, while the cheese is still warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 14001,&quot;Shrimp with Black Bean Sauce 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 2 large red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and diced 1 cup white wine 1/2 cup chicken stock, mixed with 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup cooked black beans 2 1/2 pounds large raw shrimp, peeled and deveined 10 green onions, trimmed and sliced thinly on the diagonal 1/2 small bunch cilantro, coarse stems removed Instructions: In a medium heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.

When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the pancetta and 6 sage leaves over medium heat until the pancetta renders its fat and gets crispy, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sage and pancetta to a plate lined with paper towels and set aside. Add the pork shoulder to the pancetta fat and brown the pork on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Set aside. Add the garlic, carrots, rutabaga, turnips and onion and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste, miso paste, rosemary sprigs and sage sprigs and cook for 1 minute more. Add the beer and chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Return the pork to the pan and add the reserved pancetta and sage. Cover and braise in the oven until fork-tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Allow the pork to rest for 30 minutes in the liquid. For the fried parsley: Put 1/2 inch of oil in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat until 350 degrees F. Add the parsley leaves and fry until crispy, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. For the fried onions: Put 1/2 inch of oil in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat until 350 degrees F. Mix together the flour and cayenne in a shallow bowl. Dredge the onions in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Fry in batches until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. For the fried capers: Pat the capers dry with a paper towel. Fill a small saucepan with 1/2 inch of oil. Add the capers to the cold oil and turn the heat to medium. Cook until the capers are fried and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Remove the pork from the liquid and transfer to a cutting board. Slice the pork into 1-inch-thick pieces and transfer to a serving platter. Stir the vinegar into the braising liquid. Pour the sauce over the pork and top with the fried capers, fried onions, fried parsley, mint and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 14003,&quot;Cheesy Garlic Babka Muffins 1/2 cup lukewarm whole milk One 1/4-ounce envelope active dry yeast<br> 1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 large eggs<br> 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting<br> 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes, at room temperature Nonstick cooking spray, for the bowl and muffin tin 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons red cl flakes<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 1/2 cups shredded Gruyere<br> 1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano<br> 1 large egg Flaky salt, for sprinkling<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Freshly grated Parmesan, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: For the dough: Whisk together the warm milk, yeast and 2 teaspoons sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Allow to sit until it begins to bubble, about 5 minutes. Turn the mixer to medium and add the salt and eggs. Mix until the eggs are incorporated. Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, then reduce the speed to low and add the flour in batches, allowing the flour to fully incorporate with the dough between additions. Continue to mix until well combined. Add the butter in small pieces, allowing each addition to become fully incorporated before adding more. Turn the mixer to medium and let the mixer knead the dough for 10 minutes. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Place the dough in the bowl, cover with a towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the filling: Spray a 12-cup muffin tin and set aside. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 12-by-18-inch rectangle. Brush the olive oil over the dough and sprinkle with the cl flakes, garlic, Gruyere, pine nuts and oregano. Starting from the longer side, roll the dough up tightly, similar to how you make a cinnamon roll, and pinch the edges to seal, placing it seam-side down. You should have an 18-inch log. Cut into 24 slices, then smush two slices into each muffin cup, cut-side up and overlapping. (This whole process is a little messy and rustic but when they bake and rise they will look beautiful.) Cover with a kitchen towel and set aside for 30 minutes.<br> To finish: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Beat the egg together in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the tops of the muffins with the egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt, pepper and Parmesan. Bake until puffed and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow the muffins to cool slightly, then use a sharp paring knife to run around the edges to release them from the tin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 14004,&quot;Vegan Sunflower Seed Tuna Salad 1 cup raw hulled sunflower seeds Juice of 1/2 lemon (about 2 tablespoons) 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard Kosher salt 2 tablespoons fresh dill, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons parsley leaves, coarsely chopped 1/4 teaspoon paprika 1 stalk celery with leaves, chopped 1 small shallot, chopped Freshly ground black pepper Serving suggestions: whole wheat wraps, lettuce, tomato and avocado Instructions: Cover the sunflower seeds with at least 1/4 inch of water and soak, at room temperature in an air tight container, for at least 24 hours.

Transfer each type of mushroom into its own separate bowl and add enough water to just cover, about 3/4 cup in each. Let set until the mushrooms are pliable and soft, about 45 minutes. Trim the ends of the shiitakes with scissors. Squeeze out extra liquid and reserve for later use. Thinly slice the shiitakes. Trim the hard parts off the ends of the wood ears, then thinly slice the mushrooms. Discard the wood ear liquid. Transfer both mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.<br> Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in an extra-large nonstick skillet (see Cook&#39;s Note) over high heat. Once shimmering, add the carrots and celery and cook, stirring, until just softened, about 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and stir until combined. Add 1 tablespoon of the oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon of the soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of the ground white pepper and 1 tablespoon water; stir until everything is coated. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. Wipe the skillet clean and reserve.<br> Meanwhile, lightly wet a paper towel with water and keep it on the side. Transfer 2 tablespoons of the reserved shiitake soaking liquid to a small bowl. Reserve the rest for later use.<br> Remove the bean curd skins from the package and work quickly with them so they do not dry out and crack or lose flexibility. Fold the skins in quarters and trim off about 1 inch from the rim using scissors; the rim is very dry and will not give a smooth texture to the finished dish.<br> Gently wipe both sides of 2 bean curd skins with the prepared paper towel and stack them directly on top of each other. If there are rips in either skin, don&#39;t worry; when you stack them, rotate the skins so the rips are not on top of each other. Cut one of the remaining skins in half, then cut one of the halves into quarters (reserve the remaining half for another use). Wipe both sides of one of the quarter skins and lay it on top of the stack in one quadrant. Put half of the vegetable filling, about 2 cups, directly on the quarter skin. Form the filling into a roughly 3.5-inch rectangle. Fold the right side of the large skins towards the center, then the left side and finally the bottom. Dip your fingers into the small bowl of reserved shiitake soaking liquid and brush all the sides. This will act as \\u201cglue\\u201d and help the bean curd stick better. Fold it as if you were rolling a burrito, tucking it tightly and rolling until you have formed a 10-inch-long by 4-inch-wide rectangle. Brush the seam with additional shiitake soaking liquid to seal well. Repeat with the remaining bean curd skins and filling.<br> Heat the reserved skillet with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the rolls side by side. Fry until golden brown on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and fry until golden brown again on the bottom, an additional 1 minute. Gently fry the sides, about 15 seconds each. Remove to a plate. Let cool slightly. Pour out excess oil and wipe the skillet clean.<br> Add 1 cup water, 1/2 cup of the reserved shiitake mushroom soaking liquid (if there isn\\u2019t enough, replace with water to make up the difference), a pinch of salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper to the same skillet over high heat and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the bean curd rolls to the mixture. Poke holes all over the rolls with a toothpick. Soak one side for 15 minutes, then flip and let the other side soak for an additional 15 minutes.<br> Fill a large wok or wide pot with 2 inches of water and a steamer rack.

Add egg and salt and beat until combined. Stir together flour and almonds and add to butter mixture. Slowly mix just until flour is evenly moistened. Do not let it form a ball. Remove dough from bowl onto a lightly floured work surface and form into 2 balls. Flatten each ball into a disk, wrap well, and refrigerate a minimum of four hours or as long as 4 days. These two different pastry doughs have very different textures. The first is flaky due to the incorporation of butter in small pieces: as the dough cooks, the butter melts and the water in it turns to steam and puffs up the dough. The second dough is tender and crumbly: the butter is well creamed as for a cookie; the confectioner&#39;s sugar adds tenderness due to the cornstarch it contains; the ground almonds, which can be substituted for some of the flour in any pastry dough recipe, add an interesting graininess. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 14048,&quot;Napa Picnic 1 pound Soppressata Loaf of rustic bread, sliced Bunch of radish Bunch of baby arugula Hothouse cucumber Pint of cherry tomatoes Creamy cheese Firm cheese Jar of roasted peppers Jar of whole grain mustard Instructions: Arrange the ingredients on a large cutting board. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 14049,&quot;Almond Blueberry Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter 1 cup sugar 1 large egg<br> 1/4 to 1/3 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon almond extract 2 teaspoons lemon zest, about 1 lemon 1/2 cup chopped almonds, toasted 1 cup frozen blueberries, thawed and drained Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Combine 2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon pepper and the coriander and allspice in a small bowl. Squeeze the orange halves all over the turkey and rub the juices into the skin, then stuff the squeezed oranges into the cavity along with the shallot and parsley. Brush the turkey all over with the melted butter, then sprinkle all over with the spice mixture. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wings under the body. Pour the broth into the roasting pan. Microwave the pineapple preserves in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute; strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Stir in the vinegar. Set the glaze aside. Roast the turkey until the skin is golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, brushing with the pineapple glaze twice during the last 30 minutes of roasting; use about two-thirds of the glaze. (Tent the turkey with foil if the skin gets too dark.) Remove from the oven and brush with the remaining glaze. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest at least 30 minutes before carving. Pour the pan drippings into a fat separator and let stand until the fat rises to the top. Discard the fat (or drizzle on your stuffing).

Remove the seeds and stems from the chiles, soak them in hot water for 20 minutes, drain and place them in a blender jar. Add the oregano, garlic, cumin, vinegar, oil and salt. Blend the mixture for 1 minute. (if the mixture is too thick to blend properly, add a little water and continue). Pour the cl sauce over the ribs and marinate, refrigerated for 2 hours. Cook the ribs at 2 to 2 1/2 feet from mesquite coals for 1 to 2 hours or until they are tender. If your barbecue will not accommodate this distance cook the ribs over very low direct heat, or in a Texas style smoker. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 14112,&quot;Chocolate-Orange Brown Butter Flavored Popcorn 3 cups popped popcorn, recipe follows 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons grey salt 1 orange 1-ounce bittersweet chocolate 1/4 cup olive oil 1 1/2 cups popcorn Instructions: Heat a 10-inch saute pan over medium-high heat on stovetop.

Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Add the eggs, vanilla, yeast mixture, lemon zest and nutmeg; stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead until soft and smooth, about 5 minutes. Knead in the butter in three additions, dusting the dough with flour if it&#39;s too sticky. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. For the filling: Combine the heavy cream, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until scalding. Pour over the chocolate chips, butter and vanilla in a medium heatproof bowl. Let sit for a minute to melt, then whisk until smooth and shiny. Let cool to room temperature. For the topping: Meanwhile, whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder and salt in a separate medium bowl. Work in the butter with your fingers until the mixture is sandy and chunky. Stir in the mini chocolate chips. Set aside. For the assembly: Cut the dough in half with a bench scraper or chef&#39;s knife. Using a rolling pin, roll each half into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Using an offset spatula, spread the filling on both dough rectangles, all the way to the edges. Starting from the long side, tightly roll each rectangle into a log. Wrap each log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Unwrap the logs and cut each in half lengthwise with a bench scraper or chef&#39;s knife. For each babka, twist the 2 halves together a few times, starting from the middle. Coat two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray and line each with parchment, leaving an overhang on the 2 longer sides so you can pull the babka out of the pan after baking. Place a babka snuggly in each pan. Brush each loaf with the melted butter and sprinkle with the topping. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the babkas until browned, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make simple syrup: Combine the sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan; simmer, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Let cool, then pour into a squeeze bottle. Pull the loaves out of the oven and immediately poke a bunch of holes into the babkas and squeeze some simple syrup into the holes. You will use 1 1/4 cups simple syrup evenly for the two loaves. Let sit 10 minutes, then remove the babkas from the pans and remove the parchment. Let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14115,&quot;Beer-Battered Cremini Mushrooms 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (from 1/2 large lemon) 1 tablespoon whole grain Dijon mustard, such as Maille 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 clove garlic, minced Zest of 1 large lemon 1 1/2 cups self-rising flour 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper One 12-ounce bottle dark beer, such as Negra Modela, chilled 4 cups vegetable or canola oil 8 ounces (16 to 18), small cremini mushrooms, cleaned Instructions: For the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, chives, lemon juice, mustard, thyme, cayenne, salt, pepper, garlic and lemon zest together to blend. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) For the mushrooms: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, chives, thyme, salt and pepper. Pour the chilled beer into the flour mixture and whisk until the batter is smooth. Pour the oil into a heavy large wide saucepan. Attach a deep-fry thermometer to the side of the saucepan. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until the temperature registers between 330 and 350 degrees F. Working in batches, dip a few mushrooms at a time into the beer batter to coat generously, allowing any excess batter to drip back into the bowl. Drop the mushrooms, a few at a time, into the hot oil and fry until the batter is deep golden brown and the mushrooms are tender, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain the oil temperature between 330 and 360 degrees F, 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, remove the mushrooms and drain on paper towels. Mound the mushrooms on a serving platter and place the dipping sauce alongside. Serve while the mushrooms are still hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 14116,&quot;White Chocolate Cranberry Fudge 4 cups large marshmallows (about 36) 2 cups sugar 1 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Pinch kosher salt 3 cups white chocolate chips (18 ounces) 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 2/3 cup dried cranberries, roughly chopped Instructions: Line a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with foil.

(Make sure your oven is clean!) Place three (6-inch) gratin dishes on a sheet pan and set aside. Boil a large pot of water, add a tablespoon of salt, and add the pasta. If you&#39;re using one type of pasta, cook it for 1 to 2 minutes less than the directions on the package. If you&#39;re using two kinds of pasta, start with the one that cooks longest and add the second later so they finish at the same time. You want the pasta to be quite al dente. Drain. Pour the Tomato and Eggplant Soup into a large bowl, add the cooked pasta, the mozzarella, 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper and toss well. Divide the mixture evenly among the three gratin dishes, dot the tops with the butter, and bake for 10 minutes, until hot and bubbly and the pasta begins to brown. Sprinkle each dish with 1 tablespoon of the remaining Parmesan, bake for another 4 minutes, and serve hot. Heat 1/2 cup olive oil in a medium (10 to 11-inch) pot or Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset, over medium heat. Add the eggplant and saute for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until tender. Add a little more olive oil if the eggplant is sticking. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to the pot, add the onions and fennel, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender but not browned. Add the garlic and cook for one minute, stirring often. Add the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, fennel seeds, oregano, thyme, red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Pour the can of whole tomatoes, including the liquid, into a food processor and pulse until the tomatoes are coarsely chopped. Add the tomatoes and the liquid to the pot. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasonings.

Butterfly the chicken: Remove any innards from the chicken. Put the whole chicken breast-side down on a flat surface. (I like to put a kitchen towel underneath the bird to prevent the chicken from sliding around as I work.) Find the backbone running down the center. Use a pair of sharp poultry shears or scissors to cut up along the backbone on one side and then cut along the other side. Remove the backbone and save it to add to chicken stock. Flip the bird over, breast-side up. Gently press down on the breast meat to open the chicken up and flatten it. The breastbone will break as you press. The chicken should now sit almost flat. Cook the chicken: Season the chicken on all sides with salt. Put the chicken skin-side up on a rimmed baking sheet lined with a rack, put the pan in the center of the hot oven and cook undisturbed for 20 minutes. Then lower the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and cook for an additional 30 to 35 minutes. The chicken is ready when an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the bird registers 155 degrees F to 160 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the mustard vinaigrette: Whisk the dijon and grainy mustards with the vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl.

Melt the butter with a turn of the pan of EVOO in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, fennel (reserving the fronds) and onions, sprinkle with some salt and pepper and cook until the vegetables soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Deglaze with the wine, transfer to a bowl and let cool completely. Drain and chop the raisins, and then combine with the fennel, onions, ground pork, pine nuts and thyme. For the prosciutto-wrapped pork roast: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butterfly the meat by thirds: Measure one-third from the bottom of the loin, and make a lengthwise cut along one longer side (not going all the way through to the opposite side). Continue to make long cuts to open up the meat. When you have reached almost to the opposite side of the roast with your lengthwise cuts, stop and roll the top two-thirds of the roast over. Measure the height of the rolled-over portion and make a lengthwise cut to butterfly this in half. Continue slicing and opening up the meat until the loin has been butterflied into a single slab. Pound the meat with a meat mallet to 3/4-inch thick, and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the stuffing over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll up the pork, cover with overlapping slices of the prosciutto, and tie in intervals with twine to secure. Heat 2 turns of the pan of EVOO in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the pork and brown evenly all over. Toss the potatoes and onions in a roasting pan together with the rosemary, garlic, about 1/4 cup EVOO, and some salt and pepper. Set the browned roast on top and deglaze the Dutch oven with the wine, scraping up the bits from the bottom. Pour the liquid over the pork. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees, up to 2 hours, then let rest 30 minutes under a foil tent. Before serving, place the roasting pan on a burner, deglaze with the stock and then stir in the fennel fronds and butter. Slice the roast, spoon the fennel butter jus over top and serve alongside the potatoes and onions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 14132,&quot;Thyme Creme Brulee 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 6 sprigs fresh thyme 3 egg yolks 3 1/2 tablespoons sugar, plus additional sugar for brulee tops Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl. Place the mixing bowl on top of a towel to keep it from wobbling while whisking in hot liquid. Gently whisk 1/3 of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks, to temper the yolks and prevent lumps take care not to make an excessive amount of bubbles. While gently whisking, slowly pour the remainder of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. With a spoon, skim off any bubbles that may have come to the surface. Evenly space the ramekins on a paper towel-lined baking dish to prevent ramekins from sliding. Fill each ramekin to just below the top. Place on the extended middle rack of the oven. Carefully pour hot tap water into the baking dish until 3/4 of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Be careful not to get any water on the custard mixture. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and very gently slide it towards the center of the rack. Bake for about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven. Uncover and let the custards cool in the water bath until they are cool enough to handle. Remove. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (see Cook&#39;s Note**). Evenly top each custard with 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar. Burn the sugar with a blowtorch or hot branding iron. It is important that the sugar layer is thick enough and goes all the way to the edge of the ramekin; any exposed custard can burn and curdle. Serve shortly after burning the sugar so that the burnt sugar doesn&#39;t soften. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14133,&quot;Strip Steak with Pepper Cream Sauce 4 (6 to 8-ounce) strip steaks, 3/4 to 1-inch thick Kosher salt 2 teaspoons black peppercorns, coarsely crushed 2 tablespoons clarified, unsalted butter 3/4 cup beef stock or broth 3 tablespoons cognac 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon green peppercorns in brine, drained and slightly crushed Instructions: Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Sprinkle steaks with kosher salt and crushed black pepper. Heat butter in a 12-inch, heavy bottomed saute pan over medium heat. Once butter is hot, add steaks and cook until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare and 3 minutes per side for medium. Remove steaks from pan and place on a rack set on a sheet pan; place in oven to keep warm. Add the stock to the saute pan and whisk until the crispy bits release from bottom of pan. Allow the liquid to reduce for 3 to 4 minutes over medium-high heat. Add cognac, heavy cream, and green peppercorns to the pan. Increase heat to high and cook, whisking continually, until sauce thickens slightly, just enough to coat the back of a spoon; this will take 5 to 7 minutes. Season the sauce, to taste, with kosher salt. Place steaks on plates, top with sauce, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Malbec]&quot; 14134,&quot;Chicken Salad with Fennel Spice 1 chicken, about 3 1/2 pounds 3 tablespoons Fennel Spice Rub, recipe follows, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus 6 tablespoons 1 large celery rib, halved 1 large carrot, halved 1 large yellow onion, quartered 2 bay leaves 1/4 cup thinly sliced celery heart 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced 2 to 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice Sea salt, preferably gray, and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves 1 cup fennel seeds 3 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons white peppercorns 3 tablespoons kosher salt Instructions: Lay out the chicken, spreading out the parts as much as possible. Cover generously with 3 tablespoons of the fennel spice, rubbing it into the skin. Place a large pot over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 6 tablespoons of the oil and heat to almost smoking. Add the chicken and brown on all sides, about 5 to 6 minutes per side. Add the celery, carrot, onion and bay leaves and saut for a few minutes. Add 4 cups of water to the pot, or enough to cover the chicken. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook just until the chicken is almost fully cooked, about 40 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover and let cool. When pan has cooled, place in the fridge overnight. Lift out the cooled chicken and strain the stock, discarding the solids. Refrigerate or freeze the chicken stock for another use. Remove the skin and bones from the chicken. Shred the meat by hand into rough bite-size pieces. In a large bowl, combine the shredded chicken, celery heart, red onion, 6 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons Fennel Spice Rub, and salt and pepper, to taste. Add more oil, lemon juice, or Fennel Spice Rub, if desired. Add the basil and serve. Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat. Watch carefully, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly. When light brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool. They must be cool before grinding, or they will gum up the blades. Pour the seeds into a blender and add the salt. Blend to a fine powder, shaking the blender occasionally to redistribute the seeds. Store in a tightly sealed glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 14135,&quot;DIY Yogurt Flip Cups Three 4.4-ounce fruit bowls, such as grapefruit, peach and pineapple 1 1/2 cups yogurt<br> 9 tablespoons assorted toppings, such as chia seeds, pistachios, chopped candied ginger, granola, white chocolate chips, dried cherries, almonds, goji berries and coconut flakes<br> Instructions: Drain the liquid from the fruit bowls and divide the fruit among 3 wide-mouth mason jars.

Combine marinade ingredients in a shallow non-reactive dish large enough to hold the salmon. Place the salmon in the marinade and turn to coat; let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat a grill to medium heat. Place the cedar plank on the hot grill. Once the cedar plank starts to smoke, place the salmon fillet on top of it, skin side down. Arrange the sliced onions on top of the salmon. Pour the marinade over all. Cover the grill and cook for 15 minutes. If the plank catches on fire, it can be lightly sprayed with water. The cooking time will vary based on the thickness of the salmon; allow 10 minutes per inch of thickness. The salmon may be served on the cedar plank, but be careful not to overcook as the salmon will continue cooking while resting on the hot cedar plank. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 14157,&quot;5 Minute Ode to Napoleons 12 butter lace cookies, store bought from bakery counter 24 strawberries, sliced 1 canister real whipped cream, from the dairy aisle Chocolate sauce, with a spout top, from dessert topping section Instructions: Line up 6 butter lace cookies.

Spread the ice cream in the pan in an even layer with an offset spatula. Freeze until very firm, about 4 hours. Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and cloves into a large bowl. Beat the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until smooth. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined. (If the dough seems dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water.) Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap, shape into a disk and wrap tightly. Refrigerate until chilled, about 20 minutes.<br> Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut the dough into 2-by-4-inch rectangles (a pizza cutter is great for this); you\\u2019ll get about 24. Arrange on the prepared pans, about 1 1/2 inches apart, and prick each cookie with a fork a few times down the center. Freeze until firm, 15 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bake the cookies, one baking sheet at a time, until golden on the bottom but still soft in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 5 minutes on the pan, then transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely. Lift the ice cream out of the pan using the plastic wrap and invert onto a cutting board; discard the plastic. Working quickly, cut the ice cream into twelve 2-by-4-inch rectangles. Sandwich the ice cream between the cookies, place on a baking sheet and return to the freezer. Put the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Stir in the vegetable oil. Dip each sandwich partway in the white chocolate, then sprinkle with nonpareils. Return to the baking sheet and freeze until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14159,&quot;Poached Eggs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 English muffin 2 tablespoons white vinegar 3 large eggs 2 slices cooked ham 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Lightly coat a 12-cup nonstick muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray. Mist a large nonstick skillet with more nonstick cooking spray and put over medium heat. Add the turkey bacon and cook turning frequently until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and coarsely chop. In the same skillet, heat the oil. Add the mushrooms, shallot, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook until shallots are soft and the mushrooms are dry and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the baby spinach and nutmeg until the spinach is just wilted, but still bright green, 2 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, egg whites, milk, and salt and pepper until well combined. Stir in the cheese. Divide the egg mixture evenly between the muffin tins, filling them about halfway. Top evenly with the mushroom and spinach mixture and then the chopped bacon. Bake until the quiches are well risen, golden brown and set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with greens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14163,&quot;Potstickers 1/2 pound Napa cabbage 2 teaspoons kosher salt 3/4 pound coarsely-ground pork 1 tablespoon finely-minced fresh ginger 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1/3 cup coarsely-chopped scallions 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1/4 teaspoon freshly-ground pepper 24 round wonton wrappers Up to 1/4 cup oil, for pan-frying Up to 2 cups stock 1/3 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons white vinegar 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 teaspoon Chinese chili sauce 1/3 teaspoon sugar 2 tablespoons thinly-sliced scallions Instructions: Make filling: Chop cabbage to small pieces, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt and toss well. Let stand 10 minutes, drain, then squeeze firmly to wring out excess moisture. In a large mixing bowl scatter cabbage and add pork. Sprinkle remaining filling ingredients on top. Using chopsticks, stir briskly in one direction until well-blended. Throw mixture against inside of bowl 5 to 6 times to compact it. Press plastic wrap on surface of filling and set aside 30 minutes at room temperature, or refrigerate up to 24 hours for flavor to develop. Bring to room temperature before using. Fill one wrapper at a time, keeping remaining covered. Heap 1 level tablespoon filling off-center in wrapper and shape into a half-moon, about 2 inches. Run a moist finger lightly around edge of wrapper. Pleat and press dumpling closed. Transfer dumplings as they are made to a lightly-floured baking sheet and keep them covered with a towel to prevent drying. Make sauce: About 20 minutes before serving, mix dipping sauce ingredients and season to taste. Heat a heavy 12-inch cast-iron skillet with a tight-fitting cover over high heat. When very hot, add enough oil to coat bottom with a scant 1/4-inch, swirl skillet to coat bottom and sides, and reduce heat to medium. When oil is hot, pick up dumplings by their tops and quickly arrange them, smooth side down, in concentric rings starting from outside of pan and working into center. You will be able to cook about half of dumplings at a time. Dumplings should hug each other tightly in a pretty spiral; they will stick together. Adjust heat so they sizzle mildly. When all dumplings are in place, raise heat to brown bottoms. Check frequently, and when bottoms are browned, add enough stock to come halfway up sides of dumplings. Adjust heat to simmering and cover. After about 7 minutes, check to see if almost all stock has been absorbed. Check bottoms of dumplings -- they should be crisp enough to \\clink\\ against a fingernail. If needed, add a little more oil down side of pan, swirl to distribute under dumplings and continue frying until crisp. Loosen dumplings from bottom with a spatula and invert them onto a warmed serving platter, browned bottoms up -- they should cling in a spiral. Spoon dumpling sauce into individual saucers or dipping bowls and serve immediately. Do this in two pans at once, or repeat to cook remaining potstickers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14164,&quot;Smokehouse Brisket Sandwich 1 small onion, sliced julienne 2 ounces olive or vegetable oil or bacon fat 1 diced fresh jalape?o 10 to 12 ounces chopped or pulled Smokehouse Brisket, recipe follows 1/4 cup Rube&#39;s BBQ sauce, recipe follows 2 slices smoked Gouda 1 toasted hoagie roll<br> 1/2 cup mesquite powder 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> 1/3 cup smoked paprika<br> 1/3 cup kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup au jus powder mix<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoons chili powder<br> 2 tablespoons ground cumin<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 2 tablespoons mustard powder<br> 2 tablespoons onion powder<br> 2 tablespoons ground black pepper<br> One 8- to 12-pound brisket 1/2 cup liquid hickory smoke<br> 20 ounces dark coffee 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar<br> 5 ounces molasses<br> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 tablespoons hot sauce 2 quarts ketchup<br> 1/4 cup liquid hickory smoke 2 tablespoons yellow mustard<br> 2 tablespoons garlic powder<br> 2 tablespoons onion powder<br> 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper<br> 1 teaspoon chili powder<br> 2 teaspoons mustard flour<br> 2 teaspoons ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Cook onions in hot oil until caramelized.

Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, lemon zest, nutmeg, egg, milk, and 1 1/2 cups flour; mix on medium speed until combined. Add the butter; mix until incorporated. Add 1 3/4 cups flour, and mix until the dough comes together. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in the remaining 1/4 cup flour by hand until the dough is smooth, about 5 minutes. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let stand in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Remove the dough from the bowl and punch down. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out circles with a 1-inch round cutter; place on a floured baking sheet. Let rise in a warm, draft-free spot for 30 minutes. Heat the oil in a medium pot or deep fryer until it registers 350 degrees F on a deep fry thermometer. Fry the beignets in batches, rolling them around constantly with a slotted spoon, until golden brown all over, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the beignets with the slotted spoon to a platter lined with paper towels and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve warm with the jam. Jam: Put the blackberries in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. Transfer the mixture to a large skillet and stir in the sugar and lemon juice.

In metal bowl, combine sugar and flour. In another bowl, lightly beat the eggs and add them to the sugar mixture, combining well. Blend the butter into the mixture using the back of a spoon. Add the buttermilk and blend with a whisk. If the butter has not incorporated by this step set the bowl over a pan of simmering water to help soften the butter. Add the lime juice, vanilla and nutmeg. Blend well. Slowly pour the custard filling into the pie crust. Set the pie on a baking sheet and place it in the oven for 1 hour. Remove pie and let it cool before cutting. Combine the butter, shortening, 2 cups of the cake flour, and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Blend together. Stop mixer, scrape the sides and add remaining 2 cups of cake flour and remaining 1 cup of all purpose flour. Blend to combine completely. Mix sugar and salt into 1/4 cup of the water and add it to the flour mixture. Blend briefly and add the remaining water if needed. The dough should not be overworked and should make a solid piece when held in your hand. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured smooth surface and knead it several times. Divide the dough into portions and flatten it. Wrap unused dough in plastic. Roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Reserve any unused dough in the freezer for another use.

Add the steaks, stir to coat, and let sit 10 minutes. In a paper bag, combine the flour, cornstarch, a few pinches of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove the steaks from egg mixture and put into the paper bag. Roll the top of the bag to close, and shake until the steaks are evenly coated. This may be done in batches. Let the coated steak rest on a sheet tray lined with a rack for 10 minutes. In a deep, heavy-bottomed skillet add enough oil to reach 1/2-inch up the sides. Heat the oil over medium heat to 370 degrees F. (When a wooden spoon inserted into the oil creates tiny bubbles, the oil is ready.) Fry the steaks, in batches if necessary, flipping only once when color is golden and a poke releases no red juices, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove to a serving platter and serve with Diced Potato Gravy. In a large straight-sided skillet heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and saute until tender, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the flour, stirring to combine with the butter. Add the bay leaf and broth and bring to a simmer.

Butter and flour a bundt pan or tube pan. (You can use a mixture of cocoa powder and flour instead of flour, to prevent white spots on the cake.) In a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or using a hand mixer, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Mix in the sugar. One at a time, mix in the eggs, then the vanilla, occasionally scraping down the mixing bowl. Meanwhile, in another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Add 1/3 of the flour mixture; then 1/3 of the ice water. Repeat, mixing after each addition. Transfer the batter to the pan and bake until springy and dry, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a rack, then carefully turn the cake out. Just before serving, sift confectioners&#39; sugar over the top. Serve with very cold milk! Notes about the recipe: When I developed this recipe I was just looking for a good, reliable dark cocoa cake that could sit on the counter over the weekend and be enjoyed in slivers, craving by craving. This cake is really moist and keeps for days. I just finished one that&#39;s been hanging around the kitchen for 6 days! You could frost it with creamy white icing but it hardly needs it. My friend Lana&#39;s mom June was one of the best cooks I knew as a kid in the &#39;60s and she did a cake by the same name, though the recipe handed down to me from her daughter is a bit different. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 14182,&quot;Grilled Flank Steak with Salsa Cruda 5 or 6 vine-ripened tomatoes 1 onion, sliced into thick rings 1 large red bell pepper 2 jalapeno chiles 6 to 7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for brushing bread Gray salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons minced garlic 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano leaves Gray salt and cracked black pepper 1 flank steak, about 1 pound 4 ounces Gorgonzola, crumbled 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano 4 large slices bread, cut from a good, crusty loaf Instructions: Prepare the grill and let it burn down to medium coals. Core the tomatoes and cut an X through the skin on the bottom of each.<br> In a bowl, toss the tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, and chiles with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Secure the chilies with metal or soaked wooden skewers so they won&#39;t fall through the grill grate. Place the tomatoes on the grill, X-side down and away from direct heat, with the other vegetables. Cover the grill and cook, turning the onions, bell pepper and chiles to char evenly all over, until the tomatoes have softened but are still firm enough to stand on their own and the onions, bell pepper and chilies are blistered, about 15 minutes. Put the pepper and chiles in a bowl and cover to steam and loosen the skins. Let the tomatoes cool to room temperature. In a large, shallow bowl, combine 4 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, vinegar, oregano. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside.<br> Peel the grilled vegetables. Cut the tomatoes in half horizontally and squeeze out the seeds into a sieve suspended over a bowl to catch the juices. Finely chop the onions and tomatoes. Return the tomato pulp and any juices from the chopping board to the bowl holding the tomato juices. Seed and chop the chiles. Cut the bell pepper into small dice. Mash the chiles and taste to determine their heat.<br> Add all vegetables with garlic olive oil mixture. Mix well before topping pasta or flank steak.<br> Season the flank steak with salt, pepper, and brush with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Grill, turning once, until done to your taste, about 10 minutes for rare meat (to cook indoors try a cast iron, skillet or bistecca pan). A minute before removing steak from the heat, top with oregano and Gorgonzola. Transfer to a cutting board, drizzle with another 1 tablespoon olive oil, and crumble the remaining 1/2 teaspoon oregano over the top. Let rest for about 5 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, brush the bread on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the bread on both sides until brown and crunchy on the outside but still soft within.<br> Carve the meat on the diagonal into thin slices and arrange on a platter or plates, on top of crusty bread. Top with about 1/4 cup of the Salsa Cruda, per slice of bread drizzled over each portion.

When almost smoking, add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated from the mushrooms, about 6 minutes. Add spinach and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and place mixture into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until you get a coarse texture. Place in bowl and stir in mascarpone and Parmesan cheese. Check for seasoning and set aside. Line up 3 wrappers on a cutting board. Brush with the egg and water mixture. Using a tablespoon, arrange 4 dollops of the filling on each wrapper ? 2 on the first row and 2 on the second ? 1-inch apart. Place another wrapper directly on top, pressing around the filling and sealing the edges. Using a fluted ravioli cutter, cut out squares of ravioli. Each filled wrapper will yield 4 raviolis, giving you a total of 12 ravioli. Place ravioli onto a floured baking sheet and keep covered with a linen towel. In a large pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts of salted and oiled water. Carefully add small batches of ravioli, about 3 to 4 at a time. This will prevent them from crowding in the pot and sticking together. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer, carefully remove the ravioli and place on the plate. Tent with foil to keep warm and continue cooking remaining ravioli. In a saute pan, heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. When almost smoking, add chopped mushrooms and saute until soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Carefully pour in tomato sauce and simmer for 5 minutes. Divide ravioli between 2 serving plates. Top with mushroom tomato sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and bay leaves and simmer uncovered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning.

Butter and flour baking sheet. In a saucepan combine water, butter, cut into pieces and a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat; butter should melt just as water boils. Reduce heat to medium and add flour all at once, beating with a wooden spoon until dough pulls away from sides of pan and forms a ball. Transfer dough to bowl of an electric mixer, begin beating on high speed and add 3 eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Batter should be elastic and just stiff enough to hold soft peaks. If batter is still stiff, break fourth egg into a small bowl, whisk well and add just enough of the egg to the batter to thin to proper consistency. Transfer warm dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip. Pipe 18 1 1/2-inch puffs at least 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Brush with egg wash, gently smoothing tops of puffs. Bake in upper third of oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 degrees F and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, or until puffed and golden. Remove sheet, turn off oven and piece sides of each puff several times with the tip of a sharp knife. Return sheet to turned-off oven and let puffs stand 30 minutes, with oven door ajar, to dry. Transfer to racks to cool completely. Soften ice cream to scooping consistency. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Use a small ice cream scoop to scoop out 18 1 1/2-inch ice cream balls. Freeze until solid. In a double boiler or in a bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, melt chocolates with cream and coffee, stirring occasionally, until smooth and warmed through. Add cognac or rum, to taste. Keep warm over warm water until ready to serve. To serve, slice puffs in half, fill bottom of each with an ice-cream ball and replace top. Arrange 3 on each plate and serve immediately. Pass a warm sauceboat of hot fudge sauce for each person to pour over their own dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 14221,&quot;Leg of Lamb Stuffed with Apple Wood Smoked Chevre and Golden Chanterelles 1 boneless leg of lamb (about 3 pounds) 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 pound golden chanterelle mushrooms, sliced 3 ounces shallots, minced Salt and ground black pepper 1 pound Apple Wood Smoked Chevre (or plain chevre), sliced into pieces Butcher&#39;s string or twine 4 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pound the lamb with a meat mallet until it is 1 1/2-inches thick. In a large saute pan with butter on medium heat, add the chanterelles and saute until dark brown in color. Set the mushrooms aside until needed. Season the interior of the leg with the shallots, salt, and pepper. Lay the chevre and Sauteed mushrooms evenly down the center of the pounded out leg. Roll the leg into the shape of a log and tie with butcher&#39;s string to hold the round shape. Season the exterior of the leg with salt and pepper. In a large saute pan with the olive oil on medium-high heat, sear all sides of the lamb. Place the seared leg onto a wire rack with a baking tray underneath. Place the leg in the oven and roast for approximately 1 hour, or until desired internal temperature has been reached. For rare lamb, roast to an internal temperature of 140 degrees F. and 170 degrees F. for well done. When the pan is removed from the oven, let the lamb rest for 10 minutes at room temperature before slicing. This will prevent the juices from leaving the lamb and drying out the meat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 14222,&quot;Loaded Mediterranean Cauliflower Fries One 12-ounce bag frozen cauliflower fries 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons za&#39;atar<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1/2 cup fresh parsley, leaves torn with your hands<br> 1/4 cup finely diced red onion 1/4 cup chopped kalamata olives 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 3 tablespoons chopped pickled pepperoncini 1 medium cucumber, finely diced 1/3 cup crumbled feta 1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt 1/2 cup fresh mint, chopped<br> 3 tablespoons chopped capers 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander Zest of 1 lemon plus juice of up to 2 lemons Hot sauce, to taste<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> Instructions: For the loaded fries: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Place molds in freezer for at least 10 minutes before filling. Cook the sugar, corn syrup and water to light caramel color (about 320 degrees F). Divide the caramel into 2 heatproof glass bowls. Add a few drops of food color to each bowl. You can use any color that you like. Dip the flower mold into the hot sugar. I dipped the flower molds in the red sugar and the leaf mold into the green. Set the sugar coated mold onto a silpat lined baking sheet. Repeat this process using the other molds. After a few minutes, the sugar will set and cool. To remove the sugar flower from the mold, gently push at the edge of the flower. It should pop off from the mold. Repeat the same process until you have made as many flowers as you want for your centerpiece. If you want to stick different shapes together, use more melted sugar to \\glue\\ the pieces into place. Remember, the sugar is very hot and will burn if it comes in contact with your skin. It is a good idea to keep a bowl of cold water readily available. If you get any sugar on your skin, dip your skin in the cold water to stop the burn and easily remove the sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 14226,&quot;Blood Sucker Cocktail 1 1/2 ounces Bacardi \\0<br> 1/2 ounce Cointreau 2 ounces pineapple juice 1 tablespoon strawberry or raspberry puree Instructions: In a shaker with ice pour rum, Cointreau and juice.

When the water is thoroughly boiling, add the pasta and cook according to the package directions until al dente. Meanwhile, in a large skillet or shallow Dutch oven over medium-low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and cook the pancetta to render the fat and crisp it, about 8 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon fat from the skillet. Raise the heat to medium and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Stir quickly and often so the garlic does not burn, 2 minutes at the most. Stir in the shrimp and continue to cook until just barely pink, another 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Fresno chiles, half of the lemon zest and the pancetta. The shrimp should be slightly undercooked. Drain the pasta directly into the skillet and stir everything together, letting the shrimp finish cooking and the pasta absorb some of the sauce. Add the remaining zest, 1 tablespoon butter and a drizzle of olive oil. Remove from heat and add the cheese and basil. Do not stir.

Meanwhile in a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the sugar, the salt and yolks until smooth. Whisking constantly, add half of the reduced orange juice to the yolk mixture to temper. When it is all incorporated, return the tempered yolk mixture to the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula to prevent the eggs from scrambling, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 7 minutes. Strain the mixture into a clean bowl and whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, and the zest. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the mixture and refrigerate until chilled through, at least 5 hours. Pour the heavy cream into a medium bowl, and add the vanilla and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.

Let cool to room temperature. Place the rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter 2 (8 by 2-inch) round cake pans, line the bottoms with circles of parchment and butter the parchment. Dust them with flour, shaking off excess flour. Set aside. In the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment, add the cold butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla. Beat on slow to combine and raise to medium-high speed for 8 to 10 minutes until the butter is almost completely incorporated into the mixture. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the flour mixture and the cocoa liquid in 2 additions of each, stopping to scrape the bowl occasionally, mixing just until combined. Evenly divide the batter between the 2 cake pans (I weigh them to get them even.) Bake for 45 to 55 minutes until the cake springs back when gently pressed and a toothpick in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pans 10 minutes, then place on wire racks to finish cooling completely. Make the frosting: Put the chocolate chips in a heat proof bowl and place over a saucepan of simmering water, do not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl. Stir the chips occasionally until melted, and remove from the heat to cool. In a medium mixing bowl, sift together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cocoa and salt and set aside. In the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and the cream cheese until it is light and fluffy. On low speed, slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture to the butter mixture, combining well. Add the melted chocolate and the sour cream and vanilla, mixing just until combined. It&#39;s best to use it as soon as soon as it is made. To assemble the cake: If the layers are a little uneven, then level the top of each layer. Using a serrated knife, split the first layer in half and place on a cake plate. Spread 1 cup of the frosting on top of the layer and spread to the edges. Add the next layer and spread another cup of frosting over it. Split the other layer in half, spread with another 1 cup of frosting, turn the top layer upside down so that the bottom is on top, and pile on the rest of the frosting, evenly spreading it all over the top and the sides, swirling as you go.

Taste and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use. Soak the wood chips in water at least 30 minutes; drain. Heat a charcoal grill and prepare for indirect grilling: Bank the coals to one side, leaving the other side empty. Set up a drip pan on the empty side. Let the fire burn off to a low heat (250 degrees F). Meanwhile, prepare the Blue Smoke Slaw: Using a small sharp knife, carefully remove the core of the cabbage, creating a cavity for stuffing. (Make the cavity deeper than it is wide to keep the leaves attached.) Combine the vegetable oil, garlic and barbecue rub in a small bowl; mix well. Stuff some of the mixture into the cavity in the cabbage; let soak in for a minute, then add a little bit more. Scatter a handful of the drained wood chips over the hot coals. Transfer the cabbage to the cooler side of the grill, over the drip pan, cored-side up. Cover the grill and cook until the cabbage is slightly softened and taking on color from the smoke, 2 to 3 hours, adding more wood chips halfway through and more charcoal as needed. Cut the cabbage in half and let cool for a few minutes, then thinly slice. Transfer the sliced cabbage and garlic mixture from the cavity to a large bowl. Combine the mayonnaise, red onion, scallions, vinegar, mustard and granulated sugar in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss to coat.

When it is full, empty the excess back into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated. Wipe the lip of the plastic mold clean and place upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the mold clean again with a paring knife. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When set, gently push on one side of the mold and the chocolate cup will release. Repeat to make as many cups as you would like. For the Saucer: Spread 1/4-inch thick layer of white chocolate onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Let the chocolate set until firm yet pliable but not hard. Use the tip of a paring knife to cut a 4 1/2-inch circle. If you are making more than one saucer, make all of the cuts now. Place it in the refrigerator and allow the chocolate to set completely. When set, remove from the refrigerator, and peel off the parchment paper. Set the chocolate saucer aside. Place some of the white chocolate in a small piping bag. Draw a small handle shape onto a parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Let the chocolate set until firm. If you are making more than one handle, make all of them at this point. Place the sheet pan in the refrigerator and allow the chocolate to set completely. When set, remove from the refrigerator. Gently lift the chocolate handle from the parchment paper. Set the chocolate saucer aside. To assemble, use white chocolate to \\glue\\ the handle to the cup, then \\glue\\ the cup to the saucer. Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.

This will help tenderize the meat. For the spiced milk gravy: Like any good gravy, we are starting out with a simple roux of equal parts butter and flour. Melt the butter in a medium saucepot over medium heat, then whisk in the flour. Cook the flour and butter until it&#39;s a light blond color (just enough to cook the raw taste out), about 2 minutes, and then whisk in the broth and milk. Bring the gravy to a simmer and cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in the Worcestershire sauce, peppercorns, brine, hot sauce and salt to taste and bring back to a simmer. Check for seasoning and set aside until ready to use. For the chicken-fried steaks: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Add the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, baking soda, cayenne and onion powder to a shallow baking dish. Remove the steaks from the buttermilk and place each steak in the flour mixture, coating all of the sides and shaking off the excess. Next, dip the steaks back into the buttermilk, coating them on all sides and allowing the excess to drip off. Return to the flour mixture once again, shaking off the excess. Reserve the flour mixture for dredging the steak a third time for an extra-crispy crust after resting. Let the steaks sit on a wire rack in the fridge 30 minutes (this will help the coating to really adhere to the chicken-fried steak). Then re-dredge in the seasoned flour just before frying. Heat 1-inch vegetable oil in large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Working in batches of two at a time, place the steaks in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, using tongs to turn once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat the process with all the steaks. Transfer the chicken-fried steaks to individual plates. Spoon the Spiced Milk Gravy over the steak and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 14294,&quot;Rhubarb and Apple Pie with Walnut Crumb Topping Basic Sweet Piecrust, recipe follows 2 pounds fresh rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 1-inch thick pieces 2 pounds McIntosh apples (6 to 8 apples), cored, peeled, and each cut into 12 equal slices 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons apple, cherry, or grape brandy 1 cup bleached all-purpose flour 1 cup chopped walnuts 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup solid vegetable shortening 6 to 7 tablespoons ice cold water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 370 degrees F. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface into an 11-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan. Trim off any overhanging dough to make a 1/2-inch wide overhang around the edge of the pan. Flute the edges of the dough with your fingertips. In a large bowl, mix the rhubarb, apples, sugar, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, the cornstarch, lemon juice, and brandy, and toss to coat the fruit evenly. Pour the mixture into the piecrust. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, walnuts, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and nutmeg and mix well with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle evenly over the filling. Bake until the top is golden brown and the juices are bubbling, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Mix well. Add the shortening and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water and let sit 1 minute. Using either a fork or your hands, carefully press the mixture together to form a soft ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll out the dough on the floured surface into a circle about 12-inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Gently fold the circle of dough in half and then in half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9-inch by 2-inch deep-dish pie pan. Crimp the edges and place in the oven. Bake until golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 14295,&quot;Good Brew 4 gallons plus 1 pint spring water 1 (7-pound) bag of ice 1/2 pound crystal grain, milled 7 pounds light liquid malt extract 1-ounce Cascade hops 1 3/4 ounces Kent Goldings hops 1/2 teaspoon Irish moss 1 vial British Ale yeast 3/4 cup Priming sugar, boiled with 1 pint water for 5 minutes<br> Instructions: It is very important to sterilize all equipment that will come into contact with the beer. Also the hops, yeast, and Irish moss need to be kept refrigerated until use. Begin by sterilizing your equipment that you will use to boil the mash; the pot, metal spoon, probe of the probe thermometer, colander and strainer, including the fermenter. To sterilize everything put 2 ounces of non-scented household bleach and 3 to 4 gallons of water into the fermenter. Place other smaller items in the solution to soak. The items that are too large to fit into the fermenter can be sterilized by pouring the solution in the fermenter into and over these items and then thoroughly rinsing all equipment, including the fermenter.<br> After sterilization is complete you can begin brewing beer by adding 2 gallons of spring water as well as the 1/2 pound milled grain to your pot and turn the burner on to medium high. Place the probe thermometer into the pot and set the temperature to 155 degrees, once the liquid reaches 155 degrees set a timer for 30 minutes. In the meantime soak the container of liquid malt extract in warm water; it will aid in removing it from the container. After the grain has cooked for 30 minutes add 1 gallon of water and the liquid malt extract and bring to a boil stirring so that the extract does not burn on the bottom until dissolved. The liquid will foam up to the top; when it does this, turn the heat off and let it settle then turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Let it foam again and turn the heat off, let it settle and turn the heat back on and add the hops. Add 1-ounce of the Cascade hops and 3/4-ounce of Kent goldings hops and boil for 10 minutes. Next add 1/2 teaspoon Irish moss and boil for 5 minutes. Now add the last hops, 1-ounce Kent Goldings, cover, turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Meanwhile put the last gallon and 1 pint of water as well as the bag of ice into the fermenter and fit the top with the colander and mesh strainer. Strain the mash into the fementer and allow to cool to 80 degrees before pitching the yeast. Once the mash is cooled to 80 degrees it is now safe to add the yeast, shake the vial until the liquid is well mixed and then add to the fermenter. Cover with the lid and put airlock in place. Put into cool dark place to ferment for 7 to 10 days.<br> Attach the siphon on the spigot and transfer beer from one fermenter to the second one. Add the sugar/water mixture. Bottle using the wand. Cap and place into a cool dark place for another 10 to 14 days.<br> Open and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14296,&quot;Pizzettes with Caramelized Onions, Goat Cheese, and Prosciutto 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 large onions, sliced (about 4 cups) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon herbs de Provence 1 teaspoon sugar 1 ball purchased pizza dough (about 12 to 16 ounces) 3 ounces goat cheese, crumbled (about 1/2 cup) 2 to 3 ounces prosciutto (about 5 large slices), cut into 2 by 2-inch pieces Parsley or rosemary sprigs, for garnish Instructions: In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over low heat. Add the onions, salt, pepper, herbs de Provence, and sugar. Stir to combine. Continue cooking over very low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized and dark golden brown, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.<br> Roll out the pizza dough into a 1/4-inch-thick round. Using the cookie cutter, cut out 24 dough circles. Arrange the circles on a large heavy baking sheet. Place a small spoonful of the caramelized onions on each dough circle.
