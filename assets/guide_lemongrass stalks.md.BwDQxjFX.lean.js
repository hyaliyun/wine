Bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Add the flour all at once to the boiling mixture. Stir with wooden spoon or heatproof spatula until a smooth mass forms. Keep cooking and stirring all around over medium heat to dry out the dough as much as possible, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to the mixing bowl of a stand mixer. With the paddle attachment, beat at medium speed to release steam and cool it down, about 1 minute. At low speed, beat in the whole eggs and yolks one at a time, beating until incorporated between additions. Turn the speed up to medium and beat for 1 minute to fully incorporate. The dough should look smooth and glossy. When you lift some of the dough with a spatula, it should take 5 seconds to fall back into the bowl (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> When the dough is ready, fill a pastry bag with a plain tip with a 1/2-inch opening and transfer the dough to the bag. Twist and tie the top of the bag with plastic string or twine to prevent the dough from spilling out when piping. Let the bagged dough rest at room temperature until it firms up enough to pipe, about 1 hour.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Pipe out 1-inch circles onto baking trays lined with a nonstick baking mat, leaving 1 inch of space in between the circles. Dab the top of each circle with a little water using your finger.<br> Bake for 8 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake until the tops are golden, 12 to 14 minutes more. When done, the puffs should feel weightless when lifted and the middles should be hollow. Let rest by placing the baking tray on a baker\\u2019s rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.<br> For the green tea sauce: Put the egg yolks in a heatproof bowl. Bring the milk, cream, sugar, and salt to a scald in a saucepan over medium heat (heat until you see the first sign of bubbles or to a very gentle boil). Pour the mixture into the egg yolks and whisk together to break up the yolks and combine.<br> Return the custard to the saucepan and cook over low heat with a flat edge wooden spoon or heatproof spatula, stirring and scraping the bottom constantly to prevent curdling. When the mixture is thickened and the temperature of the custard reaches 156 degrees F, about 6 minutes, remove from the heat, whisk in the matcha powder and process with a stick blender until foamy, breaking up any lumps. Keep the sauce refrigerated until serving.<br> For the macerated strawberries: In a bowl, toss the strawberries with the sugar and lemon juice and zest. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Keep refrigerated until serving.<br> Gently cut 12 to 18 profiteroles in half crosswise (3 profiteroles per serving), keeping the top and bottom of each together so they match up. Make sure the centers of the profiteroles are hollow so they can be filled with ice cream. If you come across one that is not hollow, cut more until you find one. You can freeze any additional profiteroles for later (see Cook&#39;s Note). Use a 2-ounce scoop to portion the strawberry ice cream on the bottom half of each profiterole. Place the top half of each profiterole on top. Arrange them so they are close to each other. Sift matcha powder on top of the profiteroles.<br> Arrange some of the strawberries in the center of each serving bowl. Place 3 ice cream-filled profiteroles on the strawberries. Serve each plate with 3 tablespoons of green tea sauce on the side or pour it straight onto the profiteroles.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 66234,&quot;Steakhouse Deviled Eggs 6 large eggs 1 teaspoon baking soda, optional<br> 6 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice<br> Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 slices thick-cut bacon<br> 2/3 cup fresh breadcrumbs<br> 1 sheet nori (dried seaweed)<br> Instructions: Put the eggs in a saucepan and cover with water by 2 inches. If you&#39;re using farm-fresh eggs, add 1 teaspoon baking soda to the water (see cook&#39;s note). Set the pan over high heat and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Then remove the pan from the heat and let the eggs sit in the water for exactly 10 minutes. Pour off the hot water and cover the eggs with fresh cold water. Crack the eggs gently and return them to the cold water. When cool enough to handle, peel the eggs underwater. Slice each egg in half lengthwise and drop the cooked yolks into a medium mixing bowl. (Refrigerate the whites if making ahead.) With a rubber spatula or a wide wooden spoon, paddle the yolks until smooth. Add the mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and a pinch of salt, and stir until light and fluffy. Transfer the yolk mixture to a clean quart-size plastic bag. (Refrigerate if making ahead.) Cook the bacon until lightly crisp in a skillet set over medium heat, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the bacon from the skillet, reserving 2 tablespoons of the fat, and finely mince. Add the breadcrumbs to the pan, season with a pinch each of salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat, stirring, until they turn golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Combine the breadcrumbs with the bacon. Holding the nori sheet with tongs, toast it over an open flame (or if you have an electric stove, over a burner set on high) until it shines and becomes brittle, about 30 seconds. With scissors, cut the nori into a thick stack and then into tiny pieces, as small as the bacon. Add 1/3 cup of the nori to the bacon mixture. When you&#39;re ready to serve the eggs, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Arrange the egg white halves on an oven-safe platter. Push the filling to the bottom of its bag and snip a 1/2-inch opening in one of the bottom corners. Squeeze the yolk filling into the egg whites. Warm the eggs in the oven until the yolk mixture turns soft and luscious, about 5 minutes. Cover the eggs with a dense smattering of the bacon-nori crumbles, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot]&quot; 66235,&quot;Pear Pound Cake 6 to 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour Pinch of salt 1 teaspoon baking powder Pinch of ground nutmeg 1 large egg 1/2 cup buttermilk 2 small pears, peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped 1/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spray generously with cooking spray. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, and cook, stirring frequently, until they turn lightly golden, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, and stir in the lemon zest and a pinch of salt. Whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, half-and-half, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Transfer the cooked shallots to a medium bowl. Add the ham, fontina and cornstarch, and toss. Scatter the mixture over the bottom of the lined insert. Pour in the egg mixture. Cover the slow cooker, and cook on high until the middle is set and no longer jiggles, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove the lid, dab the quiche with a paper towel to absorb any excess liquid and let rest for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, wipe out the large skillet and heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat. Add a few handfuls of spinach, and cook, tossing and stirring, until wilted; repeat until all the spinach is wilted, about 8 minutes total. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt a few grinds of pepper. Use the foil to help remove the quiche from the insert. Use metal spatulas to lift it from the foil and onto a serving platter. Top with the wilted spinach, and scatter the Parmesan over the top. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 66244,&quot;Black Bean Salad 2 cans black beans, drained, about 30 ounces 1 (15-ounce) can corn, drained 2 Roma tomatoes, diced 1/4 cup diced red bell pepper 1/4 cup diced red onion 1/4 cup diced green onions 1/4 cup diced pineapple 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced 4 tablespoons sherry vinegar Juice of 1/2 lime 3 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoons salt 1 teaspoon black pepper Pinch ground cumin Instructions: Mix all ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66245,&quot;Cran Oat Scones 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup oatmeal 6 tablespoons sugar 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 10 tablespoons cold unsalted butter 1/2 cup dried cranberries 3/4 cup buttermilk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Combine the salt, sugar and peppercorns and rub the flesh of the salmon very well with this mixture. Place the dill on top. Rub the rest of the salt-sugar-peppercorn mixture into the flesh of the second piece of salmon and place over the dill, skin side up, re-forming the salmon shape. Cover salmon with foil, then put a board or a large plate on top and weigh this down with canned goods. Refrigerate for 36 to 48 hours, turning the salmon over each day so that it cures evenly and basting with the liquid that accumulated from the curing process. Each time, weigh it down again. About 4 hours before the fish is done, make the sweet mustard sauce. To make the sauce, put the mustards, sugar, vinegar and oil in a small bowl and beat with a whisk until it has the consistency of a thin mayonnaise (the mustard thickens the liquid). Mix in the dill and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours before serving to let the flavors mellow. At the end of the curing time, remove the fish from the liquid, scrape away the dill and the seasonings and dry it well in paper towels. To serve, place on a carving board and slice on the diagonal, detaching the flesh from the skin as you do.

Cut butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Occasionally reach down to the bottom of the bowl and mix all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse ground corn meal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Beat the egg(s) in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter mixture. Stir in with a fork until the dough begins to hold together, but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all. Add the egg(s) to the work bowl and pulse ten times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. Press the dough into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough). Sandwich the disk(s) of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press it into a 6 inch circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour. Storage: Keep the dough in the refrigerator up to two days, or freeze it doublewrapped in plastic. Because the dough is thin, it will defrost quickly at room temperature when you intend to use it. Variations: SPICE CRUST: Add 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon each freshly grated nutmeg and ground cloves to the dry ingredients before mixing in the butter. Double the quantities for the 2 crust recipe. COCOA DOUGH: Add 2 tablespoons sifted non alkalized cocoa powder to the dry ingredients before mixing in the butter. Double the quantities for the 2 crust recipe. If the dough seems dry after adding egg(s), add a teaspoon or two of water, no more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66257,&quot;Puff Pastry Pepperoni Pizza Roll One 9-ounce sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed 2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella (8 ounces) 4 ounces thinly sliced salami, cut into bite-size pieces 2 ounces sliced pepperoni 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling 5 tablespoons plain dry breadcrumbs 2 large eggs, beaten in separate small bowls 2 tablespoons drained banana peppers, coarsely chopped 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, plus more for sprinkling Kosher salt Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling All-purpose flour, for the work surface 1 cup prepared pizza sauce, for dipping Instructions: Position an oven rack in the bottom position of the oven, put a baking stone or a baking sheet on it and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line another baking sheet with parchment. Toss and squeeze together the mozzarella, salami, pepperoni, Parmesan, 4 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs, 1 of the eggs, banana peppers, oregano, 1/4 teaspoon salt and red pepper flakes in a medium bowl; set aside. Dust a work surface with flour, and unfold the puff pastry sheet onto it. Roll it out into a 9-by-15-inch rectangle. Transfer the pastry to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs lengthwise down the center of the pastry. Pile and pack the cheese mixture into a log on top of the breadcrumbs, leaving a 1-inch border on the 2 short ends and about a 3-inch border on the 2 long sides. Fold the 1-inch borders to overlap the filling. Use kitchen shears to snip inch-wide strips of dough along both long sides that stop 1/2 inch from the filling, like a kind of fringe. Brush the pastry all over with some of the remaining beaten egg. Starting at 1 short end, alternate folding the strips, on a slight diagonal, over the filling to make a design that looks vaguely like a braid. The filling should be mostly covered, but some will peek out from the spaces between the strips. Holding both ends of the roll, bend it into a U shape. Brush the top and sides with more egg. Sprinkle oregano, red pepper flakes and Parmesan all over the top. Put the baking sheet with the pizza roll on top of the preheated baking sheet, and bake until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the pizza sauce. Use a serrated knife to slice the roll into pieces.

Set aside.<br> In the mixing bowl of a 20-quart standing mixer set on high speed, whip together the whole eggs and 2 pounds of sugar until tripled in volume, pale yellow and forming thick ribbons, warming the bowl of the mixer with a propane torch to increase the volume of the eggs. Set aside.<br> In another mixing bowl of a 20-quart standing mixer set on high speed, whip the egg whites and remaining 1 3/4 pounds sugar until thick, glossy, and firm peaks form. Fold the flour mixture into the whole egg and sugar mixture, and then fold in the egg whites.<br> Divide the batter equally onto 6 (18-by-26-inch) parchment lined baking sheets. Bake until the corners brown and the batter doesn&#39;t adhere to your fingers when you touch the cake, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely.<br> To assemble the cake: Place a layer of the hazelnut cake on a prepared cake board or inverted sheet pan. Brush with about one-sixth of the simple syrup and spread a generous layer of the buttercream over top. Place another layer of the cake on top and soak with the simple syrup. Spread a layer of buttercream and then a layer of ganache. Place the next layer of cake and repeat the previous steps until you have used all 6 layers of hazelnut sponge cake, ending with a layer of buttercream on the top. Chill the cake completely to set. When chilled, trim the sides, and frost with a final layer of buttercream, reserving some buttercream for garnish. Return to the refrigerator again to set the top. Spread the remaining ganache over the top to make a smooth finished coat. Trim any excess ganache from the sides of the cake. Press the toasted and chopped hazelnuts onto the sides of the cake. Decorate the cake with buttercream piped from a star tip filled pastry bag, and decorate with the gilded hazelnuts. Combine all of the ingredients and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar is dissolved and the alcohol has evaporated. Cool completely.<br> Pour sugar and just enough water to moisten it in a large heavy bottomed pot. Bring sugar to a boil, stirring constantly. Brush down any sugar crystals that form on the side of the pot with pastry brush dipped in water. Once the sugar has come to a boil, stop stirring and cook the sugar to the soft ball stage or 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer. When the sugar reaches 240 degrees F, reduce the heat to low and whip the egg whites on high speed in a 20-quart standing mixer to firm peaks. While the mixer is on high, carefully pour the melted sugar into the whipped egg whites, being careful not to burn yourself on the molten sugar. Once the sugar is combined with the egg whites, reduce the mixer speed to medium, and continue to whip the egg whites and sugar until completely cool, approximately 30 minutes. When the egg white meringue is cool, turn the mixer back up to high, and gradually add the cubed butter. The butter may separate and become watery, but continue to whip on high until the water is re-incorporated. It is very important that the egg white meringue is completely cool so as not to melt the butter. When all the butter has been added, continue to beat until the buttercream is smooth and creamy. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the coffee and vanilla extracts.<br> Place chocolate pieces in a large bowl. Bring the heavy cream and Frangelico to a boil and pour over the chocolate. Let stand 3 to 5 minutes and then whisk together until smooth and all of the chocolate is melted. Allow the ganache to cool to room temperature so it reaches a spreadable consistency.<br> Lightly spray the hazelnuts with nonstick cooking spray and wipe off any excess.

Spray with cooking spray. Remove half the marshmallows from one bag and set aside. Divide the remaining 1 1/2 bags of marshmallows evenly between 2 large microwave-safe bowls. Divide the butter between the two bowls.<br> Microwave one bowl until the marshmallows begin to melt, about 45 seconds. Stir well and microwave again until completely melted, about 30 seconds more. Add green gel food coloring and stir to turn the marshmallow mixture an even, vibrant green (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add half the rice cereal (4 1/2 cups), stirring well to coat the cereal completely and evenly. Repeat the melting process with the second bowl of marshmallows and butter, tint with purple gel food coloring and mix in the remaining 4 1/2 cups rice cereal.<br> Grease your hands with cooking spray (or use disposable gloves). Using one hand for each color, dollop blobs of the cereal mixture in the prepared pan, randomly distributing it to make several mottled layers. Once you have used all of the cereal, press the mixture into the pan to even it out and smooth the top. Let cool and set completely, at least 1 hour.<br> Use the foil overhang to lift the treats from the pan. Peel back the edges, flattening the foil to create a work surface for decorating. Trim the treat edges with a serrated knife to neaten if desired and cut into 9 rectangles. Separate the treats on the foil so there is a little space between each.<br> Put the remaining half bag of marshmallows in a large microwave-safe large bowl. Microwave until the marshmallows begin to melt, about 45 seconds. Stir and microwave again until completely melted, about 30 seconds more. Stir until smooth. Set aside until the marshmallows are just cool enough to touch.<br> Wearing disposable gloves, pull out a handful of the marshmallows and rub between your hands until you can pull long web-like strings when you separate them. Pull the strings and let them drape over the treats, scooping up more marshmallows as needed. Pull from different directions over the treats to create a web-like pattern.<br> Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave at 50-percent power in 30-second intervals, stirring well with a rubber spatula between each, until completely melted and smooth. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a small, plain tip. Pipe 8 spider legs together on a treat and place a chocolate-covered peanut or jellybean, cut side down, on top of the legs to create a spider body. Make a spider on each treat.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 66267,&quot;Smoky Caprese Sandwiches 4 sandwich-sized ciabatta rolls, split through the middle 1 large red onion, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rings<br> 5 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade 1/2 cup smoked almonds, chopped<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 3 large heirloom tomatoes, preferably mixed colors, sliced 1/4 inch thick<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 pound fresh mozzarella, sliced 1/4 inch thick<br> 1 cup arugula Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small skillet. When the oil is hot, slide in a corn tortilla. To prevent the tortilla from puffing and browning unevenly, press down on the center with tongs or a metal spoon. After about 20 seconds, flip it over to the other side and hold down the center again. When golden, remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Use three tortillas per tostada. In a small saucepan, mix the black beans with just a bit of hot sauce to give a bit of a kick. Mash the beans slightly as you warm them over medium heat. Get ready to assemble: Grab a crispy tortilla and set it on a baking sheet. Now layer beans, cheese, tortilla, beans, cheese, tortilla, beans and cheese. Bake until the cheese melts. Pull it out and layer the top with a helping of the Braised Beef Brisket, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapenos, lime juice, avocado and sour cream. Combine the beef consomme, soy sauce, lemon juice, liquid smoke and garlic in a large roasting pan (a disposable is just fine). Place the brisket in the marinade, fat-side up. Cover tightly with foil. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Cook the brisket in the foil-covered pan until fork-tender, about 40 minutes per pound (6 to 7 hours). Transfer to a cutting board, slice against the grain and put the slices back into the cooking liquid. Serve immediately, spooning the juice over the slices. You may store the pan in the fridge for up to 2 days, or freeze for use at a later date.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch square metal baking pan and line with parchment paper. To make the mochi: In a medium bowl, whisk together the rice flour, sugar, matcha powder, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl or a large liquid measuring cup, whisk together the water, coconut milk and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, cover tightly with foil and bake for 1 hour (it will still be slightly jiggly). Remove from the oven, uncover and return to the oven to continue baking in 10-minute increments until the center of the mochi is set but still slightly jiggly. Allow it to cool completely in the pan. Cover and let sit at room temperature overnight to completely set. Turn the mochi out onto a cornstarch-dusted cutting board and cut small cubes with a sharp knife. Coat all over with cornstarch to prevent sticking. These will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 weeks and will get more firm as they sit.

Rub the mixture all over the pork using your fingers, and then set the pork aside, covered, and placed in the refrigerator to marinate for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.<br> Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a nonstick pan. When the oil is hot, add the onion, and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown.<br> Add the marinated pork pieces, and fry for 6 to 7 minutes, turning once, or until golden-brown on all sides. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid, and cook for 35 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the pork is tender. Add small splashes of boiling water to the pan as necessary, if the juices in the pan dry out. Add as little water as possible as the resulting sauce should be quite thick.<br> Heat the remaining oil in a separate pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds. Caution: The mustard seeds will start to pop. Keep the pan well away from your face and eyes. Be careful of the popping mustard seeds and the splatter of oil. Once the mustard seeds start to pop, add the cashew nuts, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the nuts are golden-brown.<br> To serve the dish, either divide the rice, if using, among 4 serving plates, spoon the vindaloo alongside and pour the fried cashew nuts and mustard seeds over the vindaloo, or alternatively spoon the vindaloo into the center of 4 wheat tortillas, if using, sprinkle with chopped lettuce, and sour cream and roll up into parcels. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 66279,&quot;Pylos&#39; Moussaka 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil 3 large red onions, finely chopped 1 pound button mushrooms, trimmed and coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 pounds ground beef, or combination ground beef and lamb 2 cups chopped plum tomatoes 1 cinnamon stick 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice Pinch of ground cloves 3 bay leaves 1 cup dry white wine Salt and pepper 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 7 cups milk Salt and pinch of white pepper Pinch of nutmeg 2 egg yolks 1/2 cup fresh Greek anthotyro cheese (or ricotta), drained 1/2 cup grated kefalotyri cheese (or other hard, yellow sheep&#39;s milk cheese) 2 to 3 large eggplants, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch slices 2 large zucchini, trimmed and sliced on the bias into large ovals, 1/8-inch thick 3 large potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch slices, and kept in a bowl of water to prevent oxidation Olive oil 1 1/2 cups canned chopped tomatoes, drained Salt and pepper Instructions: For the meat sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large, wide pot and saute the onions until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic and meat and stir until the meat takes on some color, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes, spices, wine, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the sauce is thick, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (You may need to add a little water to the sauce in the beginning, so that there is enough liquid to bring to a boil.) The sauce may be prepared 1 to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated. For the bechamel: Heat the butter in large saucepan over medium heat. When it melts and is bubbly, add the flour. Whisk until the flour begins to turn a light golden color. (Be careful it doesn&#39;t get too much color.) Pour in the milk and whisk until thick. This might take 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Remove from the heat and vigorously whisk the yolks into the hot bechamel. Add the cheeses and whisk until smooth. Set aside, covered with a kitchen towel to prevent a skin from forming on the top of the sauce. The sauce may be made several hours ahead, reheated, and thinned as needed. For the vegetables: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the eggplants in one layer on an oiled sheet pan. Brush the top with olive oil. (It is best to use sheet pans with a perforated rack, to let the steam circulate around the vegetables as they bake.) Bake until soft, about 12 minutes. Remove. Repeat with the remaining eggplants slices until all are cooked to tender but al dente. They should not fall apart. In a large, heavy, nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and saute the zucchini slices, turning once. Do this in batches if necessary and replenish the oil as needed. Remove and blot dry on paper towels. Remove the potatoes from the water and blot dry with paper towels. Heat 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet and saute the potatoes over medium heat for a few minutes, just to soften but not to color. You will need to do this in batches. Set aside on platters lined with paper towels. To assemble: Spread about 3 tablespoons olive oil on the bottom of a large, deep baking pan (we use hotel pans at the restaurant). Spoon the crushed tomatoes on the bottom of the pan. Place the potato slices in a single layer over the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Place a layer of eggplant on top and season lightly with salt and pepper. Mix 6 tablespoons of the bechamel into the meat sauce. (If the bechamel is cold from having been made in advance and refrigerated, warm it slightly and loosen it up with a little additional milk, if necessary.) Spread about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the eggplant slices. Spread a layer of zucchini, season with salt and pepper, and then a layer of meat sauce. Finish with a layer of eggplant slices, salt and pepper, and the last of the meat sauce, spreading evenly on top. Pour the remaining bechamel over the top, spreading evenly with a spatula. Bake the moussaka, uncovered, until the bechamel is set and lightly golden, 45 to 55 minutes.

Set aside for about 10 minutes, while the yeast \\blooms.\\ When the yeast looks frothy, add the melted butter, molasses salt, flour, and cornmeal. Slowly add up to 1 cup more warm water, mixing with the dough hook or a wooden spoon. The amount of liquid may vary, depending on the flour, so add just enough water to form a soft, but not sticky dough. Knead by machine for about 10 minutes, or by hand for about 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Lightly oil or butter a large bowl. Shape the dough into a ball, place it in the bowl, and turn it once so it is lightly greased all over. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and place in a warm, draft-free spot. (An oven that has been heated to 200 degrees and then turned off is a perfect spot). Let the dough rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Grease 2 (9 1/2 by 5-inch) loaf pans. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut it in 1/2 and shape each 1/2 into a loaf. Place each in the greased loaf pans, return to the warm spot, and let the loaves rise until they are about doubled in size, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush the top of the loaves with the egg wash and bake for 1 hour, or until deep golden brown. To test for doneness, remove the hot bread from 1 pan and knock on the bottom of the loaf: you will hear a hollow sound if the bread is done. If necessary, return to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn both loaves out of the pans and cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 66283,&quot;Veal Chops with Roquefort Butter 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 ounces good Roquefort cheese 1 tablespoon chopped scallions 8 (1-inch-thick) veal chops Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the butter and Roquefort cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed until smooth. Add the scallions and mix until combined. Cut a strip of parchment paper 4 1/2 inches wide and place the mixture on the short end of the paper.

Cover with water by 2 inches. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When meat is very tender, turn off heat and let meat cool in liquid for 20 min, remove from broth. Set aside. Discard vegetables and strain broth through a sieve. Return broth to heat, and boil to reduce by half, about 20 to 30 minutes. When meat is cool, cut off any fat and pull into shreds about 2 inches wide. While broth is reducing, heat oil in a large skillet. Over medium heat, cook the remaining half of onions, the garlic, jalapenos, green peppers and 1 tablespoon salt until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of salt. Stir in 3 cups reduced broth and tomatoes. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat. Stir in shredded meat, parsley, oregano, and cumin. Cook 10 minutes more. Serve with white rice. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 66287,&quot;Homemade Tomato Paste 5 pounds ripe plum tomatoes, cored and quartered 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for storing 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt Instructions: Stir to combine the tomatoes with the olive oil and salt in a large Dutch oven. Cover and cook over medium heat until the tomatoes give up their juices and the skins start to peel off, about 10 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, then pass the tomatoes and their juices through a food mill fitted with the finest disk into a bowl. (If you don\\u2019t have a food mill, you can press through a sieve.) Transfer the puree to the Dutch oven. Bring to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to thicken and is reduced by about half, about 1 hour. Lower the heat so the puree is barely bubbling and continue to cook, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until very thick, 30 minutes to 1 hour more, depending on how juicy your tomatoes were. Once the puree is quite thick, keep an eye on it and cook, stirring frequently, until brick red and completely dried out (but not burnt), 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool completely. Transfer to a nonreactive jar and cover with a thin film of olive oil to prevent a crust from forming. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. For longer storage, transfer to ice cube trays and freeze. Once frozen, remove and transfer the cubes to an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 66288,&quot;Spaghetti alla Carbonara 1 pound spaghetti 4 eggs 1 teaspoon black pepper 3 teaspoons Pecorino Romano, plus extra, for serving 2 teaspoons cream, optional 3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 slices pancetta Instructions: Boil the spaghetti in salted water until it is al dente.

Add the flour and salt; pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Sprinkle in the almond extract and 4 tablespoons ice water; pulse until the dough holds together when pinched, adding up to 1 more tablespoon water if the dough is too dry. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Gently pat into a disk, using the plastic wrap to help you. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edge with your fingers. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line the crust with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until the crust is lightly golden around the edge, 13 to 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 and remove the foil and beans. Continue baking until the crust is crisp and golden all over, 10 to 12 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Make the filling: Whisk the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolks and lemon zest and juice. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thick like pudding, about 8 minutes. (Reduce the heat to medium if the mixture starts to boil.) Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time; whisk vigorously until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Whisk in the limoncello. Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours. Make the topping: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine the crushed amaretti cookies, almonds, sugar and melted butter in a large bowl. Spread on a baking sheet and bake until crisp and golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool completely.

Add the kale and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper to the soup, return to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the leaves are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the shredded chicken to the soup and return to a simmer.<br> Divide the soup among 6 bowls and serve topped with several pieces of the reserved chorizo. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 66294,&quot;Shrimp Gumbo 4 ounces vegetable oil 4 ounces all-purpose flour 1 1/2 pounds raw, whole, head-on medium-sized (31-50 count) shrimp 2 quarts water 1 cup diced onion 1/2 cup diced celery 1/2 cup diced green peppers 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1/2 cup peeled, seeded and chopped tomato 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 bay leaves 1/2 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and browned 1 tablespoon file powder Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the vegetable oil and flour into a 5 to 6-quart cast iron Dutch oven and whisk together to combine. Place on the middle shelf of the oven, uncovered, and bake for 1 1/2 hours, whisking 2 to 3 times throughout the cooking process. While the roux is baking, de-head, peel and devein the shrimp. Place the shrimp in a bowl and set in the refrigerator. Place the heads and shells in a 4-quart saucepan along with the 2 quarts of water, set over high heat and bring to a boil. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour or until the liquid has reduced to 1-quart. Remove from the heat and strain the liquid into a container, discarding the solids. Once the roux is done, carefully remove it from the oven and set over medium-high heat. Gently add the onions, celery, green peppers and garlic and cook, moving constantly for 7 to 8 minutes or until the onions begin to turn translucent. Add the tomatoes, salt, black pepper, thyme, cayenne pepper, and bay leaves and stir to combine. Gradually add the shrimp broth while whisking continually.

Top each slice with the 1 slice of Gouda and 1 slice of turkey each. Put the third slice of bread on top of one stack, and flip the remaining stack on top, cheese-side down, to make a triple-decker sandwich. Using a knife, cut the crusts off the sandwich (this helps to pinch and seal the ends). Wrap the sandwich tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours. (Wrapping the sandwich in plastic wrap, compacts it, and prevents the egg batter from seeping in.) Combine the eggs and milk in a bowl. Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Unwrap the sandwich and dip it in the egg batter, to coat evenly. Gently place it in the skillet, and fry, turning once, until golden brown and hot, about 5 minutes total. Cut the Monte Cristo in 1/2, transfer it to a place, and garnish with the strawberry and orange. Spoon some jam over each 1/2 and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66297,&quot;Lollipies One 12-ounce bag frozen mixed berries 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> Juice of 1 orange<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br> One 11-ounce box pie dough mix All-purpose flour, for rolling the dough 2 eggs, whisked with water to create an egg wash<br> Demerara sugar, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: In a food processor, pulse the berries a couple of times until they are in large chunks. Add to a medium saucepan with the sugar, salt and orange juice. Bring to a low simmer over medium heat and simmer gently until the berries have released their juices and the mixture has slightly reduced, about 20 minutes. Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl to create a slurry and add it to the saucepan. Cook until the mixture is combined and reduced, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes. While the berry mixture is cooling, make the full box of pie dough according to the package instructions. Separate the dough into 2 or 3 balls and roll each out on a floured surface to 1/8 inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut out dough rounds with a 3-inch round cutter and fill one round with 2 to 3 teaspoons of the cooled berry filling. Brush the rim of the dough with the egg wash, top with another round and then seal with a fork all the way around. Repeat until all of the dough rounds have been used. Brush the top of the lollipies with the remaining egg wash and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake on the prepared baking sheet until a dark golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Add the onions and cook until soft and lightly caramelized about 15 minutes. Add the mustard and a pinch of salt and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan to a small bowl and set aside. Special Sauce: In a medium bowl combine all the ingredients and whisk until smooth. Burgers: Preheat the broiler to low. Form the ground meat mixture into 6 equal patties. Do not over handle or compress the patties, keep them loose. This will help create a tender burger. Over mixing and compacting will result in a tough heavy burger. Heat the canola oil a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. In a small bowl combine the salt, pepper and garlic powder and season the burgers generously with the mixture. Put the patties in the skillet and cook for 4 minutes. Flip and let cook for 1 minute, then top each patty with a piece of cheese. Cook for another 2 minutes until the cheese is melted and the burgers are medium. While the burgers are cooking, lightly brush the buns with melted butter and put them on a sheet pan. Broil until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. To assemble, split the buns and spread each half with about a tablespoon of the special sauce. Put the burgers on the bottom half of each bun, top with caramelized onions, tomato and lettuce.

Add the onions and reduce the heat to medium. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a large pinch of pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onions are soft and beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the celery is just beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Lightly beat one of the eggs in a small bowl and add it to the bowl with the onion-celery mixture. Add the chicken, hot sauce, scallions and 3/4 teaspoon salt and stir until evenly combined. Lightly beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Working with 1 dumpling wrapper at a time on a clean surface (cover the remaining wrappers with a damp paper towel so they don&#39;t dry out), add 1 rounded teaspoon of the filling to the center of the wrapper. Brush the edge of the wrapper with the egg wash. Fold the dumpling into a half-moon shape and press the edges to seal. (Alternatively, you can seal the edge tightly by forming pleats.) Transfer the dumpling to a baking sheet and cover with a damp paper towel to keep from drying out while you finish assembling the remaining dumplings.<br> Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 3 batches and being careful not to crowd the skillet, add a third of the dumplings in a single layer. Sear each side until crisp and brown, about 30 seconds per side.

Lay the eggplant slices over in a single layer, sprinkling pinches of salt over the surface. Cover with another paper towel and repeat with another layer. Let the eggplants sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This will draw any excess water out of the vegetable, making it better for frying. Bring the tomato sauce to a boil in a pot. Reduce the heat gradually every 7 minutes until the sauce reaches a slow simmer. Mix together the breadcrumbs, basil, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder and some salt and black pepper in a large shallow container. Whisk together the eggs in another large shallow container. Dip each eggplant slice in the egg, and then coat both sides in the breadcrumb mixture. For frying and assembly: Heat a large frying pan over medium heat until hot. Meanwhile, saute the onions and green peppers for 2 to 3 minutes in a small pan and set aside. Pour 1/2 cup of the grapeseed oil into the hot pan. Watch for ribbons forming in the oil, then add the eggplant slices one at a time in a single layer. Depending on the size, it is important to only cook as many as the pan allows for. Fry until a light caramel color, then flip and fry the other side. Transfer to a flat paper-towel-lined plate. Once all of the eggplant has been fried, pour in the remaining oil and repeat the same process with the veal, transferring to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Place a spoonful of onions and green peppers on the bottom of the buns, topped with a spoonful of the tomato sauce. Cut the veal in half or in thirds to make them the same size as the buns. Add 3 layers of veal to each bun, then sprinkle with mozzarella and a bit more of the tomato sauce. Layer 3 to 4 eggplant slices on top. Sprinkle some of the mozzarella again, top with more tomato sauce and finish with a dusting of the Parmesan. Place the top buns on and voila!

Transfer to a bowl and add the olive oil, vinegar, basil, parsley and salt and pepper. Peel, seed and dice the peppers and add them to the bowl. Taste and season as needed. Let the relish sit at room temperature while you cook the broccoli rabe. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli rabe, cook for 2 minutes, then immediately plunge it into an ice water bath. Drain until almost dry but still slightly damp (a little bit of water helps the rabe steam on the grill). Brush the rabe with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the broccoli rabe until crisp-tender and slightly charred on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a platter, top with the pepper relish and drizzle with a bit of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 66332,&quot;Kona Coffee BBQ Shrimp and Coconut Grits Kona Coffee BBQ Shrimp: Shrimp 2 pounds<br> Bacon 1/2 pound<br> Red Bell Peppers 2<br> Green Bell Pepper 1<br> Medium Onion 1<br> Garlic 4 cloves<br> Cajun Seasoning 1 tablespoon<br> Sweet Paprika 2 teaspoons<br> Chicken Stock 1 cup<br> Kona BBQ Sauce 1/2 cup<br> Canned Pineapple Chunks 2 cups<br> Fresh Lemon Juice 2 tablespoons<br> Green Onions 5<br> Instructions: ASSEMBLY:</p><ol><li>Place a scoop of grits in a small shallow bowl and top with shrimp mixture.</li><li>Garnish with green onions.</li><li>For bacon - Chop bacon into 1/4? strips and fry until almost crispy in a large stock pot.</li><li>Add diced red &amp; green bell pepper, diced onion, and minced garlic and cook until softened about 8-10 minutes.</li><li>Stir in Cajun seasoning and paprika and cook until fragrant - about 2 minutes.</li><li>Add Kona BBQ sauce and chicken stock and cook until flavors come together - about 5 minutes.</li><li>Stir in shrimp and cook until bright pink about 7-8 minutes.

Once melted, reduce the heat to low and allow the butter to just barely simmer. Cook until the milk solids that sink are golden brown, about 6 minutes. Set aside to cool until the butter is still liquid, but not hot. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the brown butter, sugars and honey in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on low speed until combined and a homogenous mixture is formed, about 2 minutes. (The mixture will look grainy.) Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition, until incorporated. Add the vanilla. Whisk together the flour and baking soda in a small mixing bowl. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture and beat just until incorporated, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Using a small scooper, scoop 1 1/2-tablespoon mounds onto the prepared baking sheets, being sure to leave distance in between the cookies. Sprinkle with flakey salt.

Set aside. Combine the butter, shortening, brown sugar and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the molasses, vanilla and egg and beat on medium until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sifted flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined into a smooth dough, about 1 minute. Form the dough into a flat square, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until just firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Meanwhile, make templates for the gingerbread house. Gather 3 sheets of stiff paper or 2 manila folders (split at the seam), scissors, a ruler and a pencil. For the side panels, draw and cut out a rectangle that measures 4 by 7 inches. For the front and back panels of a house with a peaked roof, draw and cut out a template that is 6 inches wide at the base, 4 inches to the roofline and 4 1/2 inches slanted to a peak. The template for the roof panels should measure 4 1/2 by 8 inches. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Unwrap the dough and cut into 3 equal pieces (a pizza wheel is handy for this). Working with 1 piece of dough at a time and keeping the other pieces refrigerated, roll the dough into a rectangle 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Using the template, cut out the side panels and remove the scraps around the cutouts. Repeat with the remaining 2 pieces of dough, cutting out the front and back panels and 2 roof panels. If the dough gets too soft while rolling, return it to the refrigerator for 15 minutes before proceeding. (Discard the dough scraps or reroll to make cookies.) Chill the dough pieces on the prepared baking sheets for 15 minutes.<br> Bake the dough pieces until crisp almost all the way through (the very center will still be a little soft), 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans 10 minutes on a rack, then remove the house pieces to the rack to cool completely.<br> For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add the vanilla and 5 tablespoons water and beat on medium-high speed with an electric mixer, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed. Divide the icing between the 2 prepared piping bags (one fitted with a small plain tip and the other fitted with a large plain tip).<br> Decorate the side panels: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe a pea-size dot of icing onto the back of 1 of the peppermint hard candies and attach it to the top center of 1 of the side panels. Pipe icing onto the backs of 4 of the fig bar pieces and attach them to the panels as evenly spaced windows shutters. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows between the shutters. Line the frames with pretzel sticks, breaking them to fit. Pipe a pea-size dot of icing onto the backs of 9 of the butterscotch candies and press them along the bottom of the panel. Repeat this process on the remaining side panel. Let the panels rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the front panel: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe a double line of icing across the front panel where the roof starts to incline; press on about 11 French toast cereal pieces. Pipe a small dot of icing onto the back of 1 of the red sprinkle-coated gummy candies and attach it to the front panel just above the line of cereal. To make a flower, pipe a small dot of icing on the cut sides of 8 of the toasted-marshmallow jelly bean pieces and attach them in a ring around the red gummy. Pipe icing to draw a door; attach the caramel jelly bean with a dot of icing to make a doorknob. Pipe icing onto the backs of the gummy gingerbread people and place 1 on either side of the door. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows; line the frames with pretzel sticks, breaking them to fit. Let the panel rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the back panel: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe a double line of icing across the back panel where the roof starts to incline; press on the remaining French toast cereal as needed. Pipe a small dot of icing onto the back of the remaining red sprinkle-coated gummy candy and attach it just above the line of cereal. To make a flower, pipe a small dot of icing on the cut sides of the remaining 8 toasted-marshmallow jelly bean pieces and attach them in a ring around the red gummy. Create a decorative trim by piping a pea-size dot of icing onto the backs of the caramel-coated pretzels and pressing them along the bottom of the panel. Pipe icing to form 2 windows; line the frames with pretzel sticks, breaking them to fit. Let the panel rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the roof panels: Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe short lines of icing onto the backs of a few pieces of the frosted shredded wheat cereal and attach them to 1 of the roof panels in a row. Repeat until both roof panels are completely covered. Let the panels rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. For the caramel: Spread the sugar in a medium skillet (see Cook&#39;s Note). Sprinkle with the lemon juice and 1/4 cup water. Set the skillet over medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar melts, about 2 to 3 minutes. Once the sugar has melted, stop stirring and cook, swirling the contents occasionally, until the sugar syrup is a deep amber color, about 12 to 15 minutes. Assemble the walls: Carefully place the skillet of hot caramel by your work surface (you will use it like glue to attach the panels to the base and to one another). Dip the bottom of the front panel in the caramel and place it on the foil-wrapped base. Use a silicone brush to brush a line of caramel along the inside of the panel at the base to reinforce it. Prop up the panel with a can. Brush more caramel up 1 edge of the front panel so you can attach the side of the house. Dip 1 side of a side panel in the caramel and place it perpendicular to the front panel, forming a corner. Brush the inside of the panel along the base with more caramel to reinforce it. Prop up the side piece with a can. Repeat with the second side panel and the back panel. Sprinkle the seams of the house with sea salt.<br> Attach the roof: Once the walls are set enough to hold the roof panels and while the caramel in the skillet is still warm, remove the cans. Then brush the warm caramel onto the back of a roof panel along the edges (where the roof will attach to the walls); press the panel onto the house and hold it in place until the caramel sets, about 30 seconds. Repeat with the other roof panel. Use the piping bag fitted with a large tip to pipe icing along the seams of the roof to reinforce it. Landscape the yard: Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe a rectangular walkway in front of the house; line the edges with pecan halves and pave the middle with crushed sesame candy. Pipe icing snowdrifts around the walkway and the base of the house; sprinkle with popcorn, pressing it gently into the icing so it sticks.

Drizzle olive oil over the mushrooms and asparagus on a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast until a nice color is achieved, about 12 minutes. Set aside. Beat together the eggs with some salt and pepper in a bowl. (Do not over-beat; just mix until the eggs mostly come together.) Stir in the Monterey Jack, Parmesan and hot sauce and set aside. In a large ovenproof nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and golden brown, several minutes. Add the diced potatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir to cook for a couple of minutes. Finally, add the asparagus, mushrooms, olives and roasted red peppers and cook, stirring, until everything is hot. Make sure all the ingredients are evenly distributed across the bottom of the skillet, then pour in the egg mixture so that it evenly coats everything. Let it sit on the burner for 30 to 45 seconds to set the edges, then put the skillet in the oven. Cook, watching it carefully, until the eggs are set but not very brown on top, 10 to 12 minutes.

Stir it around to combine. Using a small paring knife, split the vanilla bean down the middle. Scrape out the caviar inside and add it to the pan along with the bean. Stir the mixture around and heat it up until it&#39;s hot but not boiling. Add the egg yolks to a medium bowl and whisk them vigorously until the yolks are slightly lighter in color, about 2 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean from the saucepan. Grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and drizzle it very slowly into the yolks, whisking constantly. This will temper the egg yolks so that they don&#39;t scramble when they&#39;re added to the saucepan. Add another ladle of the hot liquid, and when it&#39;s mixed in, pour the egg mixture slowly into the half-and-half mixture, stirring with a spoon until the mixture is thick and coating the spoon, 2 minutes or so. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean glass bowl and strain the custard. Don&#39;t worry if it looks a little lumpy! That just means you&#39;re perfectly imperfect. Add the heavy cream to the bowl and stir to combine. Divide the mixture into three pitchers; set aside one pitcher to work with for the chocolate ice cream layer, and chill the other two. For the chocolate ice cream layer: Melt the dark chocolate chips with the heavy cream over a double boiler. When the chocolate and cream mixture is smooth and melted, add 1 cup of the reserved custard and combine. Return this mixture back to the pitcher. (This step is to ease the mixing process to make it easier to pour back into the custard and could therefore be omitted.) Whisk the cocoa into the pitcher. Pour into an ice cream maker and churn as per the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. (This will take approximately 1 hour.) Line two 6-cup loaf pans with plastic wrap. Scoop half of the chocolate ice cream into each. Smooth them over and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour. To make the vanilla ice-cream layer, add the second pitcher of custard to the ice cream maker and churn according to the instructions. (Again, approximately 1 hour.) Remove the loaf pans from the freezer and spread half of the vanilla ice cream in each. Smooth and return to the freezer for at least 1 hour. For the strawberry ice cream layer: Combine the strawberries, sugar and red food coloring in a blender and puree until smooth (or you can stop just short of smooth if you want a little texture). Pour the pureed strawberries into the final third of the chilled custard mixtures and stir. Pour into the ice cream maker and churn. Remove the two pans from the freezer and scoop half of the strawberry ice cream into each, making the final layer. Smooth and return to the freezer for at least an hour. To serve: Remove the loaf pans from the freezer, turn them upside down onto a serving plate and remove the plastic wrap. Slice neatly with a knife that has been dipped in very hot water. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions are based on general guidelines and may vary depending on personal taste preferences.&quot; 66368,&quot;Beef Satay with Peanut Sauce 1 cup peanut oil 3 stalks lemongrass, crushed 1/2 teaspoon crushed dried cl peppers 2 1/2 tablespoons Thai curry powder 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce (can be purchased at most grocery stores) 3 pounds beef top round or flank, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips Peanut Sauce, recipe follows 1 tablespoon peanut oil 1 tablespoon minced garlic 6 slices cl pepper, minced 1 cup peanut butter 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 cup lime juice 1/4 cup soy sauce 1 tablespoon finely chopped lemongrass 12 ounces water Instructions: Combine marinade ingredients in a shallow pan or bowl.

Turn on the machine and very slowly start to drizzle in the oil (drip until the mixture starts to look like mayonnaise, then you can start adding it in a slow, steady stream). If the mayonnaise is too thick, add a few drops of water; if it is not thick enough, add a little more oil with the motor running. Make the salad: Put the potatoes and garlic in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the potatoes by 2 inches and season generously with salt. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until fork-tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the onion, celery and vinegar. Season with salt. Drain the potatoes and transfer them to a large bowl (discard the garlic). Add the bacon-onion mixture to the hot potatoes and stir to incorporate. Gently stir in 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise and the mustard and season with salt. Refrigerate until cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66371,&quot;Southern-Style Green Beans with Bacon and New Potatoes 8 small new potatoes, halved if large Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 slices bacon, cut into thirds 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 pounds fresh green beans, ends trimmed Instructions: In a large saucepan or medium Dutch oven, cook bacon over medium heat until it has rendered most of its fat and has begun to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the green beans and potatoes and enough water to just cover them. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover the pan and simmer until the beans are very tender, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally and adding more water if necessary to keep the beans covered. As the beans get close to being done they will become quite fragile, so take care when stirring. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 66372,&quot;Greek Strudel with Chicken and Rice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds), cut into 1-inch pieces Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 teaspoon paprika 1 small bulb fennel, cored and chopped, plus 2 tablespoons chopped fronds 1 red bell pepper, chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 cup basmati rice 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped (not oil-packed) 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives, chopped Finely grated zest of 1 lemon 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 4 ounces manouri cheese or goat&#39;s-milk feta, crumbled (about 1 cup) 8 sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed 1 stick unsalted butter, melted Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the chicken all over with salt, pepper and the paprika. Add to the pot and cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add the fennel bulb and bell pepper to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth and return the chicken to the pot; bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, olives, lemon zest, scallions, parsley, oregano, fennel fronds and cheese; stir to combine. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay out 1 sheet of phyllo on the parchment and brush generously with melted butter. Layer another sheet of phyllo ontop; brush with butter. Repeat with the remaining 6 sheets of phyllo; do not butter the last sheet. (Reserve about 2 tablespoons butter to brush the outside of the strudel.) Mound the chicken mixture down one long side of the phyllo, about 2 inches from the edge. Use the parchment to lift the phyllo and roll it around the filling to make a long cylinder with open ends; arrange seam-side down on the parchment. Cut several small slits in the top of the roll and brush with the reserved melted butter. Transfer to the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut into thick slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 66373,&quot;Sturgeon with Caper, Olive and Tomato Sauce 1 pound sturgeon fillet, cut into 2 pieces 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 cup sliced onion 1 teaspoon fresh chopped rosemary 1/4 cup dry-cured or brine-cured olives, pitted 3 teaspoons capers 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/2 to 3/4 cup fresh tomato sauce (or a very good canned one) 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Preheat saute pan over medium high heat (hot pan, cold oil, food won&#39;t stick) until just warm and add the olive oil. Let oil heat and place fillets in the pan. Let sides brown for 1 minute or 2, then add onion. Stir until onion starts to become translucent. Add garlic and rosemary. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until garlic just begins to brown. Flip fillets over to brown. Add olives and stir in. Then, add capers. Stir for 1 to 2 minutes, then, add white wine. Increase heat for a few minutes to reduce wine. Reduce heat to medium and add tomato sauce. Stir to combine all ingredients and let sit for a few minutes. Flip fillets so that both sides are coated with sauce. Fish is done when there is resistance to pressure. (Check also with your seafood market person about recommended cooking times for the fish.) Freshly ground pepper can be added during the cooking, but salting the dish isn&#39;t necessary since there is a lot of salt in the olives and capers. Serve with rice, pasta, or couscous. Garnish with a sprig of fresh rosemary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 66374,&quot;Duck Sate with Pomegranate Sauce 1/4 cup red onion, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced 1/2 cup celery leaves 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup pomegranate juice 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 (4 to 6-ounce) duck breasts Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil Instructions: For the salad: In a small bowl, combine the onions, celery leaves, and oil and toss well to coat. Season the salad, to taste, keeping cold until plating.<br> For the sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the pomegranate juice, vinegar, and sugar for 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the cinnamon, and cook for an additional 4 to 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken to almost a syrup consistency. Once reduced, remove the sauce from the heat, whisk in the butter, allowing the butter to fully incorporate into the sauce. Hold at room temperature.<br> For the duck: Place the duck breasts on a cutting board, skin-side down, and slice from top to bottom into 6 or 7 (1/8-inch) thick slices. Season with salt and pepper on both sides, then thread each slice onto a 10-inch wooden skewer in a ribbon fashion. Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat until wisps of smoke appear. Season the duck again with salt and pepper and add to the hot pan, searing on each side for 2 minutes, cooking in batches if necessary.<br> To serve: Place 2 skewers of duck sate over a bed of salad and drizzle with the pomegranate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 66375,&quot;Uniq Fruit Marmalade 1 lemon, lightly scrubbed in warm water 2 uniq fruits (about 1 1/2 pounds total), lightly scrubbed in warm water 3 pounds granulated sugar Instructions: Quarter the lemon and remove any seeds.

Quarter the uniq fruits. Separate the flesh from the rind with a knife and finely chop the flesh; scoop up the juice and flesh and add them to the pot. Cut the rind quarters in half lengthwise so they are about 1 inch at their widest point. Slice the rind pieces crosswise into thin strips and add to the pot. Add 6 cups of water and cook over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then refrigerate the whole pot overnight. Bring the pot back to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer, cooking until the rind pieces are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the sugar a little at a time until fully dissolved. (This will prevent burning on the bottom of the pot.) Continue to simmer until the mixture is thickened and glossy and an instant-read thermometer reads 220 degrees F, about 35 minutes more. Pour the marmalade into glass jars and cool at least 2 hours before using.

Sprinkle center with Coconut Grass. Top with the Jordan almonds. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup cupcake tins with paper liners. (To avoid cupcakes sticking if they overflow slightly, lightly spray the tops of the pans.) Put tins on a baking sheet. Set aside. Process sugar and butter in a food processor until very creamy, scraping sides as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, pulsing after each addition. Add the milk, water, and vanilla and process to blend. Whisk both flours, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients, in 3 batches to the wet, pulsing, and then scraping batter off the sides of the processor as needed after each addition. Process until the batter is very smooth, about 2 minutes. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared cups, filling them 3/4 of the way full. Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Whisk the milk and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Slowly beat the butter and sugar, in another medium bowl, with an electric mixer until incorporated. Raise the speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and scrape the sides of the bowl down with a rubber spatula.) Add the fluff and salt and reduce the speed to low. Add the milk and vanilla mixture, scrape the bowl down, and mix until fully incorporated. Raise the mixer to high and beat briefly until fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Frost cupcake immediately. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a mesh rack on top, if available. Put coconut in a shallow bowl. While tossing with a large spoon, add food coloring drop by drop until the desired color is reached (see Cook&#39;s Note). A little more green than yellow makes a pretty grass color. Add a few tablespoons water to moisten the mixture and help disperse the color evenly. If the color is too dark, add additional water, as needed, to dilute to the desired color. Drain the coconut in a sieve or strainer. Spread the coconut in an even layer on the rack, or directly on the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. Use immediately, or store in covered container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 66382,&quot;Gingerbread Birdhouse 2 cups shortening 4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter 14 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 2 cups sugar 1/3 cup ground ginger 3 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon fine salt 3 cups dark corn syrup 2 1/2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract All-purpose flour, for rolling out the dough One recipe Royal Icing, recipe follows Cornstarch and vinegar or confectioners&#39; sugar, to thicken Royal Icing<br> Cornstarch and vinegar or confectioners&#39; sugar, to thicken Royal Icing Candy for decorating, optional 2 pounds confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons meringue powder (egg white powder) Food coloring, as desired Instructions: For the gingerbread birdhouse: Melt the shortening and butter together in a medium saucepan. Let cool. Sift the flour, granulated sugar, ginger, cinnamon and salt into a large bowl. Mix the melted butter into the flour mixture with an electric mixer until sandy. Add the corn syrup and vanilla, and mix until evenly incorporated, but still crumbly in texture. Press the dough together by hand and divide into 8 equal parts. Press into rough squares about 1-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Place the dough on top of a flour-dusted sheet of parchment. Roll a square of dough about 1/4-inch thick and into an 8- by 11-inch rectangle. Repeat with all the remaining squares. Stack them up and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, click here to e-mail a link of the template to your desktop or laptop computer for printing. Print the file at 100-percent on letter-size paper and cut out the pieces. Remove the top sheet of parchment from the dough. Lay the templates on the rolled dough slabs and cut out all the pieces with a long, sharp knife or pizza cutter. (You will have a total of 8 cut panels plus 3 extra sheets for cookies. Cut out the remaining dough with cookie cutters of your choice.) Use a 1 1/2-inch circle cookie cutter to cut the hole for the door opening into one of the tall walls. Stack panels on a cookie sheet and chill 45 minutes to set. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position the oven racks so they are evenly spaced. Bake the gingerbread shapes until they are a rich tawny brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack. With a fine kitchen rasp, file the panels to make all the edges straight. Thicken about 2 cups of the Royal Icing with either cornstarch and a couple of drops of vinegar, or confectioners&#39; sugar, to get the consistency of caulk. Fit a pastry bag with a medium round tip and fill it with the thickened icing. Pipe a generous amount of Royal Icing along the bottom and the sides of a short wall. Center the wall of the base 3/4 inch from one edge. Use a box or can to help support the walls while they dry. Pipe Royal Icing along the bottom of a tall wall, and stick it to the base with an edge pressed against the icing on the first wall. Repeat with the remaining two walls in the same manner until the four walls are up, making an open box with a 3/4-inch border all around the base. (The two tall walls will face each other.) Allow the icing to dry completely, about 24 hours, before attaching the roof. Ice the sloped edges on one side of the house and attach the big roof piece. (Line up the top of the roof with the peaks of the tall walls.) Use a box or can to prop up the overhang of the roof while it dries in place. Attach the smaller roof piece on the other side of the slope (prop it up with a box or can) leaving the same amount of overhang. Leave the top open for now. The last roof panel is the lid and will go there when all is dry. Pipe Royal Icing neatly on the outside of the seams to secure them, and allow the house to dry for 24 hours. Fit tips into piping bags. Divide the remaining Royal Icing into batches and color as desired. Fill bags with the icing and decorate the house and roof with icing and candies if using. Allow to dry. Fill the house with cookies. Rest the remaining roof slab on the house to make a lid. Enjoy. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3/4 cup water in a large bowl. Mix slowly with an electric mixer until stiff enough to form peaks; the icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is over beaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, and then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting.<br> Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. Gels are best with royal icing. You don&#39;t want to thin them with liquid colors. Be careful of adding too much color, which reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days. Store the icing at room temperature, covered, with plastic wrap on the surface. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66383,&quot;No-Cook Chocolate Coconut Budino 3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk 3/4 cup coconut yogurt, such as COYO (dairy-free preferred) 1/4 cup good quality unsweetened cocoa powder 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch of kosher salt 1/3 cup chia seeds Chopped chocolate covered almonds and whole raspberries to serve Instructions: In a medium bowl whisk together the almond milk, coconut yogurt, cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla and salt.

Combine the oatmeal, flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl and make a well in the center. Add the egg and olive oil to the well and mix with a fork. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead into a smooth ball. Cover with a towel and let rest 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the beef, onion, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper to taste in a bowl and set aside. Prepare the toppings: Whisk the yogurt, garlic, cup water, and salt to taste in a bowl. Heat the olive oil in a small skilletover medium heat. Add the pepper flakes and paprika and cook 1 minute. Set the yogurt sauce and spiced oil aside. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. On a floured surface, roll each piece into a 20-by-4-inch rectangle, then cut into 2-inch squares. Place 1 teaspoon beef filling in the center of each square, fold over into a triangle and press the edges to seal. Boil the dumplings in batches, stirring occasionally, until they float, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to bowls. Top with the yogurt sauce and spiced oil.

With a sharp knife, carve out a circle in the top of the watermelon to make a lid, as you would when carving a jack-o&#39;-lantern. To prepare with an immersion blender: Set the watermelon in the sink (to avoid splashes). Remove the lid and insert an immersion blender into the flesh. Gently push and move the immersion blender down and around in the watermelon to puree the center. As more of the watermelon becomes pureed, move the blender to the sides to puree almost all of the flesh, leaving a thin wall of flesh lining the rind. Pour the pureed juice out of the watermelon; you should have between 6 and 7 cups. To prepare with a drill: Fasten one beater from an electric hand mixer to the tip of a drill and tighten the chuck. Set the watermelon in the sink (to avoid splashes) and push the beater into the flesh. Gently push and move the beater down and around in the watermelon to puree the center. As more of the watermelon becomes pureed, move the beater to the sides to puree almost all of the flesh, leaving a thin wall of flesh lining the rind. Pour the pureed juice out of the watermelon, and strain, discarding any pulp and seeds; you should have between 6 and 7 cups of strained juice. Insert a tap in the empty watermelon according to the package directions. Pour the watermelon juice, wine and vodka into the watermelon and top with the lid. Refrigerate until the watermelon and punch inside are well chilled, at least 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 66391,&quot;Coq au Vin 4 chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks kept attached, skin removed 1 bottle red wine 4 cloves garlic, smashed 2 sprigs thyme 1 bay leaf 1 bunch fresh parsley, half whole, half chopped 1/4 cup olive oil 1 Vidalia onion, chopped 1 carrot, chopped 2 celery stalks, chopped 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons tomato paste 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 cups chicken stock 1/2 pound thick-cut bacon, cut in fours 1 pound button mushrooms, halved 8 ounces frozen pearl onions, thawed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound pappardelle noodles, cooked al dente, warm 3 tablespoons butter Instructions: In a large bowl, add chicken with wine, garlic, thyme, bay leaf and the whole parsley stems.

Using a mandolin or a thin knife, slice eggplant lengthwise into thin strips. Toss the eggplant with 1/4 cup coarse salt. Transfer the eggplant to a colander and allow to sit overnight. (This will remove any excess water from the eggplant and allow it to crisp nicely when fried.) Brush the salt off the eggplant slices. Heat oil in a large skillet until approximately 350 degrees. Carefully fry eggplant slices in the oil until golden brown, approximately 30 seconds on each side. Drain the slices on paper towels, set aside until needed. In a medium bowl mix together 2 cups tomato puree, oregano and 1 tablespoon chopped garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Grease a 8 by 8-inch square pan, and layer the eggplant on the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle some of the mozzarella cheese mixed with the parmesan cheese, pepper, and drizzle the tomato sauce over the cheese. Repeat the process the pan is full. Bake the lasagna for 20 to 25 minutes until the cheese is melted and golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 66411,&quot;Thanksgiving Spoon Salad 1 1/4 pounds butternut squash (from about half a large squash), peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 3 sprigs fresh thyme plus 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 ounces Tuscan kale, tough stems removed<br> 8 ounces Brussels sprouts, root ends trimmed<br> 2/3 cup pecan halves<br> 8 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 1 shallot, thinly sliced<br> 5 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br> 2 teaspoons honey<br> 1/2 cup dried cranberries Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Add the pepperoni and oil and saute until the fat renders out and the pepperoni is slightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning and garlic and saute until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add the crushed tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste; stir and simmer for about 15 minutes. Let cool completely. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F with a rack in a lower position. Spray the insides of four ovenproof bowls or crocks with plenty of cooking spray. Shingle 6 to 8 slices cheese inside each bowl so the bottoms touch. This creates the coveted cheese bowl effect. Place 3 to 4 mushrooms on top of the cheese. Then ladle about 1/2 cup COOLED pepperoni sauce over the mushrooms. Split the dough into 4 equal portions and roll each portion out on a lightly floured surface into 6- to 8-inch rounds. (You will want a 1-inch overhang over the side of the bowl.) Drape a round of dough on top of each bowl. Spray your fingertips with cooking spray and slide them around the outside edges of the bowls so that the pizzas will slide out easily after baking. Gently pull down and press the dough around the edges to create a seal. (There&#39;s no need to vent or dock it.) Place the bowls on a sheet pan. Bake until the crust is just SLIGHTLY golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then brush the tops with melted butter to make that crust shiny! Very gently and carefully turn over a bowl into an individual bowl or plate. Take the handle end of your fork and swipe around the inside of the crust rim to help loosen and separate it from the bowl. Lift the bowl away and witness the miracle of this cheesy behemoth. Top with some giardiniera, if you like. Repeat with the remaining pot pies. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 66416,&quot;Chicken and Wild Rice Casserole Two 6-ounce boxes long-grain and wild rice mix, such as Uncle Ben&#39;s 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing dish 16 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced, or two 4 1/2-ounce cans sliced mushrooms, drained (reserve the liquid)<br> 1 small onion, chopped<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 3 cups chicken broth<br> 3 cups half-and-half<br> 4 cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, diced<br> 1 cup toasted slivered almonds, coarsely chopped<br> 1/2 cup sliced pimientos 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Cook the long-grain and wild rice mixes according to the package directions.

Make a cross-wise cut about 1/3 deep on the belly of each of the 18 shrimps, so shrimp will not curl up after being fried. Wash all 2 pounds of shrimps, then drain and pat dry with paper towel. Add seasonings (A) to the 18 tail-on shrimp and mix thoroughly, then set aside. Put the rest of the shrimps (no tail shells) into a mini food processor, add seasonings (B), except the cilantro and green onions, then blend at high speed for 90 seconds, or until it forms into a fine, smooth paste. Then add the cilantro and green onion, and continue blending for a few seconds more so they are completely mixed into the paste but still maintaining texture and color contrast. Scrape paste out, then form into 18 equal portion balls, each weighing about 1 ounce. Thoroughly wash hands. Use the corn oil to coat both palms. Put the shrimp paste ball in 1 palm then press 1 tail shell-on shrimp into center. Engulf the shrimp with the paste, turning and smoothing out until the paste is evenly wrapped around the whole length of the shrimp, exposing only the tail shell and resembling the general appearance of a whole shrimp. Put the paste wrapped shrimps on a lightly oiled pan or plate. Batter: Beat the egg well with a wire whisk. Pour batter ingredients into a mixing bowl in the following order: flour, potato starch, baking powder, egg, and about 1/2 of the water. Gently beat the mixture using a whisk while pouring the water in. Continue beating while you slowly add the rest of the water and finally the oil to form a smooth batter. Set aside. Preheat frying oil or shortening to 350 degrees F for deep-frying. Dip each paste wrapped shrimp into the batter, coat evenly then deep fry for 3 1/2 minutes, or until golden brown, turning occasionally. Then lay the shrimps on layers of paper towels to remove excess oil.

Pulse until the garlic is finely chopped. Add the lemon juice and egg yolks and pulse until combined. With the motor running, slowly add the oil in a thin stream. Do not rush this step; it should it should take about 1 minute. If the oil is added too quickly, the aioli may break. Season with more salt and lemon juice as needed. Serve cold or at room temperature. The aioli may be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days. For the shrimp stock: Combine the shrimp heads and shells and 2 cups water in a small saucepot. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the saffron. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the saffron time to infuse the stock. Strain the shrimp stock and reserve. For the fideos: Set a paella pan over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and all of the butter. Add the vermicelli and toast, stirring regularly, until light golden brown, about 5 minutes; do not walk away during this step, as the noodles can burn easily. Transfer the noodles to a bowl. Coat the paella pan again with another 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, add the chorizo and cook until the spices from the sausage begin to color the oil. Add the onions and cook until softened and aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Add the smoked paprika and red pepper flakes and season with salt. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 6 minutes. Set an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the broiler. Add the toasted vermicelli, the reserved shrimp stock and the chicken stock; it should come to 4 cups total liquid. Lower the heat to medium and cook until all liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring every few minutes. Season the shrimp with salt and toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the noodles are cooked but still have a little al dente bite to them, stir in the asparagus, then arrange the shrimp and mussels on top of the noodles. Transfer the paella pan to the oven and broil until the top is golden brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes; rotate the pan halfway through for even browning. Watch closely during broiling to prevent burning. You&#39;ll know the paella is ready when the top of the spaghetti is nicely browned, the shrimp are bright pink and the mussels have popped open. Garnish with the parsley and serve with lemon wedges and smoked paprika aioli. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Rioja]&quot; 66432,&quot;Garlic Tie-the-Knots 2 1/2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 teaspoons instant dry yeast<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br> 1 cup warm water<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for the bowl<br> Flaky sea salt, for topping<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 4 large cloves garlic, finely grated or pressed through a garlic press<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes<br> Instructions: For the dough: Combine the flour, yeast, kosher salt and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and stir to combine. Add the warm water and oil and beat until the dough comes together, about 2 minutes. If the dough is too wet, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it is still soft and slightly sticky but you can turn it out. Knead on a lightly floured work surface if the dough is still shaggy. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the garlic butter: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and wait for it to start sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the parsley and crushed red pepper flakes. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Turn the dough out onto the surface and divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Divide each of those pieces into 6 pieces. Working 1 piece at a time, roll it out into a 6- to 7-inch rope, then tie the rope into a knot. Place the knot on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough. Brush the knots generously with the garlic butter and sprinkle lightly with the flaky sea salt.

Add the garlic and onions and saute until tender, 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, red pepper flakes and some salt and black pepper and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir the basil leaves into the sauce at the end of simmering, if using. For the eggplant and pasta incaciata: Grease the bottom and insides of the springform pan with softened butter. Mix 1/4 cup of the breadcrumbs with 2 tablespoons of the Parmigiano cheese. Coat the inside of the pan well with the cheese mixture. Knock out any excess and discard. Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the ground pork and sprinkle with salt and black pepper and saute until cooked through. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Stir in the red wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add 4 cups of the red sauce and bring back to a simmer. Cook for another 5 minutes and season with salt and black pepper. Reserve the remaining red sauce for another use. Meanwhile, slice the eggplants lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick planks. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the eggplant with salt and black pepper and fry in a single layer, working in batches, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, using 3 tablespoons of oil per batch. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Combine the cooked pasta with the mozzarella and ragu in a large bowl. To assemble, line the bottom of the prepared springform pan with a single layer of eggplant, then line the sides with the eggplant planks vertically, allowing the excess to hang over the outside. Fill the inside of the lined pan with the pasta mixture, pressing down gently. Fold the flaps of eggplant over the top of the pasta, using any remaining eggplant slices to cover the top. Cover with plastic and weigh it down with a plate. Refrigerate for a few hours and up to overnight. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the top with the remaining Parmigiano and breadcrumbs. Cover the top loosely with foil, place on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until bubbling and the top is golden brown, an additional 15 minutes. Let rest for 15 to 20 minutes and cool slightly before unmolding from the pan.

Let the ham sit at room temperature for 30 minutes and trim off any skin. If your ham is not a spiral-cut ham, use a sharp paring knife to score through the fat in a diagonal crosshatch pattern without cutting through to the meat. Place the ham, flat side down, on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Pour 1 cup water into the pan. Bake until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the ham registers 130 degrees F, about 2 hours 30 minutes (about 15 minutes per pound\\u2014reduce the time to 10 minutes per pound for a spiral-cut ham). Meanwhile, make the glaze: Whisk the brown sugar, maple syrup, soy sauce, orange zest and juice, Dijon, vinegar, cinnamon, cloves, onion powder and a few grinds of black pepper in a medium saucepan until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the glaze has thickened and reduced by half (you should have 1 cup glaze), 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside until the ham is ready. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Brush half of the glaze over the ham. If the water in the bottom of the pan has evaporated, add 1 cup water. Return the ham to the oven and roast for 30 minutes, brushing with the remaining glaze every 10 minutes (two more times) before returning to the oven. Let the ham cool for 15 minutes before thinly slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 66438,&quot;Cauliflower-Chickpea Flatbread 2 cloves garlic, crushed and 1 clove garlic, chopped 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 small head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets (3 to 4 cups) 1 shallot, sliced One 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds store-bought pizza dough, at room temperature (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 medium jalapeno 1/2 small bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems roughly chopped (about 1 cup) 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more for serving (from 1 lemon) Flaky sea salt, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Heat 1/2 cup olive oil in large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the 2 crushed garlic cloves, cauliflower and shallot and cook, stirring often, until the cauliflower begins to soften and the shallots begin to caramelize slightly, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the chickpeas and continue to cook, stirring often, until everything is well combined and the chickpeas are heated through but still hold their shape, another 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Brush a rimmed baking sheet with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Gently stretch the pizza dough to fit the pan. (If the dough shrinks back, let it rest a few more minutes before stretching again.) Spoon the cauliflower mixture evenly over the dough. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cauliflower is browned in some spots, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the jalapeno in half crosswise and remove the seeds if you&#39;d like less heat. Roughly chop the bottom half and thinly slice the top half into rounds. Combine the chopped garlic clove, chopped jalapeno, cilantro, lemon juice, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and few grinds black pepper in a blender and puree until smooth.

Toothpicks (for the peppers, not your teeth silly) Instructions: Preheat the grill. Mix each package of cream cheese with chopped garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, and a dash of chopped basil. Add a pinch of salt. Mix until mixture is soft and manageable. Slice each jalapeno lengthwise on 1 side, being careful not to cut the jalapeno in 1/2. Remove the seeds if you don&#39;t think your friends can handle the heat, otherwise leave&#39;em and enjoy watching your friends shed a few extra tears. hehe... Depending on your pepper, you may have to slice around the stem of the pepper to create a manageable opening to squeeze the filling in. Fill either a pastry bag, or your choice of tools with the filling. Use something that will allow you to sqeeze the filling into the opening of the pepper with ease. I&#39;ve used a plastic frosting tool, cookie press, and even just a small spoon to squeeze the filling in. However you choose, insert a liberal amount of filling into each jalapeno. Be careful not to overfill as the filling may spurt out during cooking. Wrap each pepper with 1 to 2 strips of bacon, securing the opening in the pepper. Secure the bacon with a toothpick (best to soak the toothpicks first, to prevent burning on the BBQ). This also helps the jalapenos from falling into the BBQ (you&#39;re bound to loose at least 1, oh well). Long metal or wood skewers also work well for large amounts. BBQ the peppers until they lightly roasted, or until the bacon is fully cooked. Use some foil to cook on if your peppers are cooking or burning too fast on a HOT BBQ.

Add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the honey. When the honey has melted, stir it together with the oil. Place the lemons, cut-side down, into the honey mixture; cook until the lemons look charred and the honey has caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the lemons to a baking sheet and let cool. Set the skillet aside. Juice the roasted lemons and add 1/4 cup of the juice to a bowl; whisk in the remaining 1 teaspoon honey and the mustard. Once combined, whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil until the dressing becomes emulsified. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve. For the salad: Return the skillet to high heat. When hot, add the cherry tomatoes and season with salt. Cook until the caramelized honey coats the tomatoes and the tomatoes just begin to char, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Combine the escarole, Treviso, almonds, basil and mint in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Toss the salad with the dressing, and then gently fold in the charred tomatoes. Transfer the salad to the serving platter and, using a peeler, shave Parmesan over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 66452,&quot;Turkey Tetrazzini Crisp Vegetable oil cooking spray 1 pound short pasta, such as rotini or gemelli Kosher salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 pounds ground turkey Freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 quart whole milk 2 cups chicken stock 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 1 small bunch fresh sage, leaves chopped 1 1/2 cups panko (Japanese) bread crumbs, or regular bread crumbs 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13 by 9-inch pan with the vegetable oil cooking spray. Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, salted water until it has softened a bit but is still not quite cooked all the way through. (The pasta will absorb the liquid from the sauce as it finishes cooking in the oven.) Drain, rinse with cold water to stop the cooking, drain again, and set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the turkey. Cook, breaking up the meat into large clumps, until it is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season it with a little salt and pepper. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to drain any excess liquid from the meat. Let the pan cool a bit, then add the remaining butter and melt it over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Whisk constantly until the flour has cooked but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the milk slowly, whisking to avoid creating any lumps. Add the chicken stock, cayenne, and nutmeg and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to thicken, about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the sage and season with some salt and pepper. Fold in the turkey and pasta, making sure it is all well coated with the sauce. Pour into the prepared pan. To make the topping, combine the bread crumbs and Parmesan and moisten with the melted butter. Spread topping evenly over the tetrazzini, put the pan into the oven, and cook until the top is golden brown and the mixture is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving. You can also fill 8 individual greased 10 to 12-ounce ramekins with the tetrazzini and topping. These will bake in about 20 minutes. These can be frozen: Make sure they are cool, then add 1 tablespoon milk, chicken stock, or water to each ramekin. Wrap them well in plastic wrap and put them into the freezer. Poke a hole in the plastic wrap and microwave on defrost for 5 minutes, then microwave on high heat for about 8 to 10 minutes or until the tetrazzini is hot and bubbling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 66453,&quot;Calamari, Tomato and Caper Salad 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, minced 5 Roma tomatoes, chopped 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound calamari, cleaned, sliced into 1/4 to 1/2-inch slices 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained 1 lemon, zested Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: For the salad: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and red pepper flakes and cook for 2 minutes. Season the calamari with salt and pepper and add to the skillet. Saute, stirring frequently, until cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the mixture in a colander. For the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, oil, capers, and lemon zest until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the calamari mixture to a serving bowl. Pour in the dressing and gently toss until all the ingredients are coated. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 66454,&quot;Lemon Cream Daisies 2 eggs 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 3 to 4 lemons) 1/2 lemon, zested 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, slightly softened at room temperature 1/2 cup chilled heavy cream 1 package puff pastry (2 sheets), thawed 2 tablespoons chopped pistachios 1 flower-shaped or fluted cookie cutter, 2 to 2 1/2 inches across 1 plain round cookie cutter, 1 inch across 1 cookie sheet Instructions: Bring about 2 inches of water to a simmer in a large saucepan. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the eggs and sugar together until very light yellow and fluffy. Mix in the lemon juice and lemon zest. Rest the mixing bowl in the saucepan, with the bowl&#39;s base resting above--not in--the simmering water (pour out some water if necessary). Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thickened and custardy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, half-fill a large bowl with ice and cover with cold water. Remove the bowl with the custard in it from the hot water and whisk in the butter until melted. Rest the bottom of the bowl in the ice bath and let cool, folding the mixture occasionally to cool and thicken it. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the cream until stiff. Fold into the cooled lemon custard. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. (The recipe can be made up to this point and kept refrigerated up to 3 days in advance.) Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Flour a work surface and lay out the puff pastry. Roll the sheets lightly with a rolling pin until smooth and flat. Use a 2-inch fluted cookie cutter to cut out rounds from the puff pastry. Cut out the centers by pushing halfway down with a 1-inch plain round small cookie cutter. Do not pull out the centers yet; you&#39;ll do that after they are baked. Arrange on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. After 10 minutes, rotate the pan to ensure even cooking. When baked, immediately remove to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature. Cut around the centers with a paring knife to loosen, but don&#39;t cut all the way through to the bottom. You want to leave a thin layer of pastry to hold the filling. Pull out the centers to make a hollow in the center of each pastry round. Before serving, spoon or pipe a generous dollop of custard into each pastry round. Sprinkle the custard with chopped pistachios. Serve within 6 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 66455,&quot;Southern Fried Barbecue Chicken 4 eggs 1/2 cup water 3/4 cup milk 3 tablespoons garlic salt 3 tablespoons black pepper 5 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon mesquite seasoning 2-3 cups oil for frying, or as needed 1 4-pound chicken, cut into pieces Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup (8 ounces) favorite barbecue sauce 1 can (22 ounces) BUSH&#39;S? Bourbon and Brown Sugar Grillin&#39; Beans Instructions: An American classic with a little twist from below the South, this crisp and smoky chicken is sure to become a barbecue favorite. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, water, milk, 2 tablespoons of garlic salt and 2 tablespoons of pepper until smooth. In a large flat pan stir together the flour, remaining tablespoons of garlic salt, pepper, onion powder and mesquite seasoning. Fill a large heavy skillet or wok halfway full with oil and heat over medium-high heat to 365 degrees Fahrenheit on the barbecue grill or side burner. Use tongs to dip each chicken piece into the egg mixture, then into the flour mixture, back into the egg mixture and back into the flour mixture again. Set on a platter until all pieces are coated. Cook the chicken in batches, do not overcrowd the skillet. Brown on each side. Coat a large baking dish generously with nonstick cooking spray then arrange the fried chicken pieces in the pan. Pour the barbecue sauce over the chicken. Bake in the oven at 365 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes in the barbecue sauce, until the sauce has bubbled and caramelized and a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken breast has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Serve with one can (22 ounces) BUSH&#39;S?

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-frying thermometer. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper. Set aside. In a separate large bowl, stir together the ricotta, mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, milk and eggs until combined. Add the flour mixture to the cheese mixture and mix until a thick and sticky batter forms. Cover and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br> Working in batches, with two large spoons, scoop approximately 2 tablespoons of the batter and carefully slide it into the hot oil. Don&#39;t overcrowd the pot. Cook the fritters until deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes, turning them in the oil from time to time. (To get nice, smooth fritters, periodically dip the spoons in the hot oil; it will allow you to get a \\clean\\ scoop.) If the oil starts to gurgle and sputter, and the temperature has gone way up, you may need to reduce the heat to medium or even medium-low and gently bring it back up to 350 degrees F as needed.<br> Use a spider to remove the fritters from the oil and transfer to the prepared pan. Place the fritters in the oven to keep warm while you repeat with the remaining batter. Serve immediately, with Spicy Tomato Sauce.<br> In a large. Wide saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent, light golden, and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, red pepper flakes, pepper, and salt to taste. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce has thickened, 35 to 45 minutes. Use immediately or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate or freeze until ready to use. The sauce will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or up to 2 months in the freezer.<br> In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine the milk, cream, and salt and heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring from time to time to keep it from scorching on the bottom, until it registers 190 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat, add the lemon juice, and gently stir the mixture a couple of times. Let sit, undisturbed, for 5 minutes. The mixture will look curdled, with curds distinctly separating from the whey. Meanwhile, line a colander with a few layers of cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl. Gently pour the curds and whey into the colander and let drain for at least 1 hour. After 1 hour, the ricotta will be soft and spreadable; after 2 hours, it will be somewhat firm but still spreadable. The ricotta will firm up further in the refrigerator. Discard the whey or save it for another use. Serve right away or transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use. The fresh ricotta will keep for up to 4 days.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 66457,&quot;Roast Chicken with Radishes 1 (4- to 4 1/2-pound) roasting chicken Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon, quartered 6 sprigs fresh thyme 1 1/2 pounds radishes, preferably mixed heirloom, trimmed and scrubbed 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 66468,&quot;Poire Belle Helene Poached pears, recipe follows Chocolate ice cream, recipe follows 2 cups heavy cream, whipped Chocolate sauce, recipe follows 1 quart water 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 1/2 lemons, juiced 1 1/2 vanilla beans 4 ripe Bosc pears<br> 4 cups whole milk 7 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 8 egg yolks 1 cup whole milk 10 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/3 cup sugar Instructions: To assemble the Poire Belle Helene, place a scoop of chocolate ice cream at the bottom use a sundae glass. Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the ice cream then place a pear on top. Drizzle more chocolate sauce on top of the pear, and top it with whipped cream and another drizzle of sauce. Pour the water, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice into a non-reactive 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Using a sharp knife, slice the vanilla beans in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the skins by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside. Add the seeds and skins to the mixture and continue heating. Peel and core the pears but do not halve them. Coring the pears from the bottom will encourage the poaching liquid to seep inside the pear and help it cook evenly inside and out. Add the pears to the lemon mixture and bring to a boil. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook for about 1 hour. Do not overcook the pears; they should be soft enough to pierce easily with a wooden skewer or toothpick.<br> In order to keep the pears immersed in the liquid and help them to poach evenly, you must make a parchment paper lid to cover them. To make the lid, cut a round disk from a sheet of parchment paper that is slightly smaller than the diameter of your pan. Place the paper lid directly on top of the pears and poaching liquid. When the pears are fully poached, pour them and the poaching liquid into a clean container. You will need 1 whole pear for each serving. Heat the milk and chopped chocolate together in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan (this will keep the milk from burning) over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edge of the pan. While the milk is heating, combine the sugar and egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly incorporated and thick. Temper the egg mixture by pouring about half of the hot milk into it and whisk well. Now pour the tempered egg mixture into the remaining hot milk and chocolate. Cook over medium-high heat until slightly thickened, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. The mixture has finished cooking when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spatula, about 3 to 5 minutes. If you want to reduce the cooling time, you can cool the chocolate ice cream base over an ice bath. When the mixture is cool, spin it according to the type of ice cream machine you are using. The ice cream is ready when it is creamy and smooth, like the consistency of soft-serve ice cream. Place the ice cream in an airtight container and store in the freezer until ready to use. Pour the milk into a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. When it boils, remove the milk from the heat and make a ganache by adding the chopped chocolate. Whisk well, stirring into the edge of the saucepan to combine. The ganache should be homogenous and smooth. Set the ganache aside. In a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the heavy cream, butter, and sugar. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. The butter should be completely melted and the sugar completely dissolved. Once the mixture has come to a boil, pour the cream into the warm ganache. Place the sauce over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk. As the chocolate sauce cooks, it will begin to thicken slightly. When it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and pour it into a clean, dry bowl. Cover by placing plastic wrap directly on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Let the chocolate sauce cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator. When cold, the chocolate sauce will become thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling, Brachetto]&quot; 66469,&quot;Shepherd&#39;s Pie in a Half-Roasted Squash 3 tablespoons olive or canola oil 1 pound ground lamb 5 large russet potatoes 8 tablespoons butter, melted 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 medium red onion, diced 2 (16-ounce) cans corn, or the kernels from 6 fresh ears 1 large butternut squash 4 cups sour cream 3 large acorn squash Salt and freshly ground black pepper Brown gravy, for serving Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large pan over medium heat, add oil and onion. Saute onion until soft, but not brown. Add ground lamb to pan and continue cooking for 12 minutes or until cooked through and browned. Season with salt and pepper. In a separate, small pan over medium low heat add 2 tablespoons butter and corn kernels. Cook for 3 minutes and season with salt and pepper. Cut butternut squash in half and place skin side down on a baking pan. Roast the butternut squash for approximately 40 minutes at 400 degrees F or until very soft. When finished, cool slightly and scoop out meat from the skin with a large spoon. In a bowl, mash the butternut squash and add 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Season with salt and pepper, place aside. Peel potatoes and place in a large pot. Add enough cold water to cover potatoes by 1 inch. Put pot, covered over high heat and bring to a boil until a thin bladed knife or toothpick can be inserted easily, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash potatoes with 4 tablespoons of butter and 1/4 sour cream. Season with salt and pepper and put aside. Cut acorn squash in half the long way and remove seeds with a spoon. Cut a small piece off the back of the squash so it will lay flat on a baking sheet. Roast cut side up for 40 minutes at 400 degrees F until soft. To assemble, place equal amounts of corn in each acorn squash to form the first layer. To create the second and third layers, place a generous amount of ground lamb and butternut squash on top of the corn. Top with mashed potatoes using either a spoon or pastry bag and pipe. Place filled squash on baking sheet pan and roast in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees F or until potatoes are browned. Serve hot with brown gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 66470,&quot;Cauliflower Fritters 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons canola oil, plus 6 cups for frying 2 teaspoons coriander seeds, lightly crushed 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1 1/2 (12-ounce) bottles beer 1 large head cauliflower, stem removed, broken into bite-size pieces, washed and thoroughly dried 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, washed and dried Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, 2 teaspoons canola oil, coriander seeds, and red pepper flakes. Stir to blend. Whisk in the beer. Set aside in a warm place for 15 to 20 minutes. It will puff up slightly, like bread dough. Gather the cauliflower in a medium-size bowl and use a small strainer to sprinkle it with an even layer of the paprika. Toss to blend. In a large pot, heat the remaining 6 cups oil to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and place the florets on the tray as they come out of the oil. Stir the batter slightly. To test the consistency of the batter and the temperature of the oil, put a couple of pieces of cauliflower on a slotted spoon and submerge them in the batter. It should coat the pieces lightly. Cook&#39;s Note: If the batter is too thick, add a little water to thin it out. If the batter is too thin, sift and whisk in a little more flour. Drain the excess batter and lower the cauliflower into the oil. It should bubble slightly and the cauliflower should gradually rise to the top. Fry until light brown, about 3 to 5 minutes and then transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Fry the cauliflower in small batches. Season with salt, sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 66471,&quot;Yuzu Miso 1 onion, diced 1 fennel, diced 4 garlic cloves, sliced 2 tablespoons minced ginger Pinch red chili flakes Blended oil 2 konbu sheets 1 cup mirin 1 cup rice vinegar 1 cup vegetable stock 1 cup soy sauce 1 cup packed bonito flakes 3/4 cup miso 1/4 cup yuzu Instructions: Saute onion, fennel, garlic, ginger, red chili flakes in blended oil.

Preheat the oven to 500F. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning as needed, until almost crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool, then crumble and set aside. Reserving the bacon drippings in the skillet. Meanwhile, place the broccoli in a mesh strainer or fine colander and run cold water on it to thaw. Set it over a bowl to strain out excess water. Put it in a medium bowl, pour 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings over it, sprinkle with some salt and pepper and toss to coat; set aside. Dust the work surface with a little flour. Put the parchment paper on a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet. Halve the pizza dough and cover one half with a towel. Drape the other half over your fist and gently tug and turn it, letting the weight of the edges help stretch it thinner, until you have a round about ?-inch thick and 12 inches across. Place the dough on the parchment and scatter with 1 cup of the Cheddar, then half the broccoli, leaving a 1-inch border. Slide the parchment onto the hot pizza stone and bake for 5 minutes. Crack 1 egg into each of three small bowls. After the pizza has baked for 5 minutes, rotate it and slide the eggs onto it, spacing evenly. Scatter ? cup of the remaining cheese and half the bacon on top. Bake until the pizza is browned and crisp on the bottom, the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 5 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and let sit for 2 minutes to allow the eggs to set. Repeat with the other half of the dough and the remaining ingredients. Slice and serve with crushed red pepper flakes or hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 66490,&quot;Slow-Cooker Asparagus-Barley Risotto 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups pearled barley 2 sprigs fresh thyme 3 cups low-sodium vegetable broth 1 pound (1 bunch) asparagus, rough stalks trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces 2/3 cup grated Parmesan Zest of 1 lemon, plus lemon wedges, for serving 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh mint Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

If you have a good thick steak, it can handle a lot of seasoning. If you are using a thin steak, be easy on the salt. Put half of the butter in a very hot skillet, gently so you don&#39;t splatter hot butter all over the place. Add the onions first. The more rare the steak you desire, the longer you should saute the onions before starting the meat itself, (3 to 4 minutes for rare, etc). Now, gently add the steak to the skillet and sear thoroughly on each side to your desired doneness. If you can&#39;t tell how done the steak is by feel, use an instant-read thermometer: Extra Rare-below: 125 degrees F When the steak achieves the desired temperature, remove to a plate, leaving the onions in the pan. After you remove the steak from the heat source, it continues to cook, so I take my steaks off a little ahead of time. Add the rest of the butter after you have let the skillet come back up to temperature. Stir in the chipotles and deglaze the pan with the beer. Pour over the steak once the beer has reduced by half and serve. Rare: 135 degrees F . Medium-Rare: 145 degrees F . Medium: 160 degrees F . Well Done: 170 degrees F . &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 66543,&quot;Huli Huli Chicken on the Grill 1/2 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup sugar 3 bay leaves 3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 3 cups ice One 5- to 7-pound whole chicken 1 cup pineapple juice 1/2 cup ketchup 1/2 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1/2 cup light brown sugar 2 teaspoons ground ginger 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon paprika 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin Freshly cracked black pepper 1 lemon, juiced Instructions: Begin by placing the whole chicken, breast-side down, on the preparation surface. Using kitchen shears, remove the backbone by cutting up from the tailbone to the neck on both sides. Open the bird, remove the breastbone and wishbone. Make small cuts on both sides below the thighs to tuck the wings under so you have a flattened \\spatchcock\\ chicken. To a small saucepan, add 1 cup water, the salt, sugar, bay leaves and garlic cloves. Bring to a simmer to dissolve the salt and sugar. Once at a simmer, turn off the heat and add the ice. Once the liquid is cool, place into a resealable bag over a bowl and add the chicken to the brine, making sure it is completely submersed. Allow to brine in the fridge for 1 hour. In a small saucepot over medium-low heat, combine the pineapple juice, ketchup, soy sauce and sherry vinegar. Once the liquid simmers, whisk in the brown sugar and ginger. Continue to simmer until the liquid begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand (or prepare ahead and refrigerate until ready for use). Once ready for use, reserve about a cup to serve. Preheat a grill to medium heat.<br> Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Thoroughly mix the garlic powder, salt, paprika, cayenne, onion powder, cumin and some black pepper together in a small bowl. Coat the chicken with the dry rub, making sure to sprinkle well inside the cavity. Lay the chicken flat on the preparation surface, making a neat, rectangular package with the thighs tucked next to the breasts and the wings inserted into the slits. Secure the chicken in a medium rectangular wire-mesh grilling basket and set over an open grill flame. Char with the breast side down first, 7 to 8 minutes. Turn once and continue to grill, bone-side down for another 15 minutes. Continue to turn as it cooks so it doesn&#39;t burn and it replicates the Huli Huli machine cooking process. Squeeze the lemon juice over the chicken as you turn it. Finish by alternating sides until the chicken is thoroughly browned, the skin is crispy and a digital instant-read thermometer tucked under the breast confirms the internal temperature is 165 degrees F. The total cook time will be 35 to 40 minutes. With a heat-resistant silicone pastry brush, glaze the chicken with the Huli Huli sauce the last 5 minutes. Remove from the basket and allow the chicken to rest for 6 to 8 minutes.<br> Carve the chicken into breasts, thighs and wings. Arrange on a large serving dish alongside the reserved Huli Huli sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 66544,&quot;Creamy Turkey-Spinach Curry 1 large onion, chopped 1 2-inch piece ginger, peeled and chopped (about 1/4 cup) 3 cloves garlic 1 tablespoon curry powder Kosher salt 3/4 cup plain low-fat yogurt, plus more for serving 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 pound 99%-lean ground turkey 1 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for topping 3 cups cooked brown rice, for serving Instructions: Puree half of the onion, 2 tablespoons water, the ginger, garlic, curry powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor until almost smooth; set aside.

Add the water and yogurt. Using a rubber spatula, give it a mix to just combine. Place the bowl on the stand mixer and mix with the dough hook on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl and hook as necessary. The dough will be soft and smooth, but sticky, and will pull away from the sides of the bowl when it has mixed long enough, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a large, oiled bowl, cover with plastic, and allow to rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with the butter and dust all over with the cornmeal, tapping out any excess. On a cornmeal-dusted surface, roll out the dough to a rectangle that is roughly 20-by-10-inches and just under 1/2-inch-thick. With a small, offset spatula, spread 1 side with an even layer of strawberry jam, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the top. Repeat with the blueberry jam on the other side. Roll up into a tight log and pinch the edges to seal. With a sharp knife, slice into 12 even rolls. Place alternating rolls in the prepared baking dish and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight (anywhere from 8 to 12 hours is fine; try not to exceed 14 to 16 hours) or let rise at room temperature for another until doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. When ready to bake, remove the rolls from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for an hour (unless they proofed at room temperature). Remove the plastic wrap, brush the tops with the egg wash. Bake until the rolls are a deep golden brown and the top feels hollow when you tap on it, start checking at 25 minutes. While the rolls are baking, prepare the Glaze (recipe follows). Remove the rolls from the oven and cool for 10 minutes. Drizzle over the glaze and serve. These can be stored in an airtight container on the counter for a day or so (reheat in the microwave). Combine the powdered sugar, yogurt and salt in a bowl and whisk until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66562,&quot;Mustard Glazed Beef Short Ribs 4 pounds beef short ribs Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon whole butter 1 large onion, chopped 2 carrots, chopped 1 celery stalk, chopped 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 tablespoon ground cumin 12 ounces dark beer 3 cups beef stock 2 tablespoons each of rosemary, thyme and oregano tied in a bouquet garni of cheese cloth 1/2 cup pommery mustard 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Season the short ribs with salt and pepper and brown well in the oil and butter combined in a large saute pan. Remove the ribs and place into a casserole or roasting pan. Add the onion, carrot and celery to the saute pan and begin to caramelize the vegetables. Continue to cook the vegetable mixture before adding the jalapeno, garlic, tomato, cumin, beer and stock in quick succession. Bring this mixture to a rapid boil before pouring over the ribs in the casserole. The liquid should not rise more than 2/3 up the side of the ribs and the ribs should not be entirely submerged. Place the casserole into the oven, add the bouquet and braise the ribs until fork tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the casserole from the oven, allow to rest for several minutes before placing the ribs on a sheet pan. Degrease the braising liquid, strain the vegetables out and discard and reserve the remaining juices for serving. Combine the mustard and honey in a bowl and liberally brush over the ribs. Place the ribs back into the oven and roast another 10 minutes until the glaze is caramelized dark and delicious. Serve with the cooking/braising liquid in a sauce boat. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 66563,&quot;Spicy Pineapple Upside-Down Cake 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 2/3 cup sugar One 20-ounce can pineapple rings 2 tablespoons fresh red Thai chiles, chopped 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 cup coconut milk 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 large eggs Instructions: For the caramel topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter just the sides of a 9-by-3-inch round cake pan. Stir the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Cook, no longer stirring, but gently swirling the saucepan occasionally until the mixture is the color of light amber, 4 to 5 minutes. (If needed, brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a pastry brush dampened with water.) Remove the saucepan from the heat, and carefully whisk in the butter (use caution; the mixture can bubble up considerably). Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, tilting the pan to cover most of the bottom (be careful; the pan will be very hot from the caramel). Lay the pineapple rings in the pan and fill each hole evenly with the chiles. Set aside. For the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and crushed red pepper flakes in a medium bowl; set aside. Combine the coconut milk, buttermilk and vanilla in a small bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk mixture and mixing until just incorporated.<br> Pour the batter over the pineapple in the cake pan and spread evenly. Bake until the cake is golden brown and bounces back when pressed and a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until just cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter over the cake pan and, while holding them together, quickly flip them over so the cake unmolds, pineapple-side up. Let cool completely.

Stir to moisten the sugar and insert a thermometer. Cook until the temperature reaches 220 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Add the Tia Maria and simple syrup and stir for 1 one minute, or until smooth and thoroughly combined. Cover the sauce and keep it warm near the stove until it is served. Can deep, dark, intense, rich, velvety smooth chocolate be a spiritual experience? It certainly is heavenly when mixed with cream. Praise the pastry angels and pass the bonbons! This is the basic ganache recipe. Use it for truffles, tarts, fillings, you name it. Follow the same technique when adjusting the recipe for firm and soft ganache. An alternative food processor method is given, which can be applied to any ganache recipe in this chapter. My desire is not only to introduce you to ganache but also to make it a staple in your refrigerator. As long as you don&#39;t eat it all as a midnight snack, it can be available to help you throw together dessert at a moment&#39;s notice. Using a serrated knife, finely chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch pieces. Don&#39;t be lazy here. Big chunks will not melt. Traditional method: Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boiling means the cream will actually rise up in the pan and threaten to boil over. Immediately pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate. Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let it sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl, and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until all the chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. It may look done after 1 minute of stirring, but keep going to be sure it&#39;s emulsified. Food processor method: Place the chopped chocolate in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat (or bring to a boil in the microwave.) Immediately pour the hot cream into the food processor, on top of the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then pulse the machine 3 times. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and pulse 3 more times, until all the chocolate is melted. This smooth, silky chocolate is now ganache. Transfer the ganache to a bowl. Let the ganache sit at room temperature until it cools to 70 degrees F. In a 65 degree F room, this will take approximately 4 hours or 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can speed up the process by pouring the ganache out onto a clean baking sheet (thinner layers cool faster.) Once the ganache reaches 70 degrees F, it is ready to be used. At this point it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 66591,&quot;Oven Roasted Maple Gorp 3/4 cup maple syrup 1 cinnamon stick 1 vanilla bean, split 1 cup oats 1 cup peeled hazelnuts 2 cups whole natural almonds 1/2 cup golden raisins, a couple of handfuls 1/2 cup dried sweetened cranberries, (recommended: Craisins brand) a couple of handfuls 1/2 cup shelled pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds 1 cup chocolate and candy coated peanuts (recommended: Peanut M&amp;Ms) Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Gradually pour about half of the hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds to melt chocolate. Slowly whisk it until smooth and homogenous. Add the remaining cream gradually--the shock of the hot cream can cause the fat in the chocolate to separate or break, if added too quickly--and mix until all of it is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous. It should be thick, shiny and smooth. Add the Grand Marnier and mix to fully incorporate. Pour the ganache onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet to cool. When the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste but is still easily spreadable, it is ready to be used. If the ganache has set too much, soften it by heating a small amount in a saucepan placed over medium heat until melted. Then quickly, but gently, stir the melted ganache into the harder, cooler ganache. If its still too hard, repeat the procedure until the desired consistency is reached.<br> Cake layer: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium bowl with an electric mixer, combine corn syrup, egg yolks, butter and almond flour. Beat at medium high speed until light and fluffy. Add dark rum (or substitute vanilla and orange zest).<br> In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat egg whites until foamy. Add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Increase mixer speed to medium high and whip to stiff but not dry peaks, about 7 minutes.<br> Fold the meringue into the butter mixture all at once. Using a rubber spatula fold up from the bottom of the bowl, careful not to deflate the meringue. When the two mixtures are just incorporated, add the warm chocolate. Fold again, carefully. Use a whisk, if the meringue does not fold in well.<br> Pour the batter into a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and spread it evenly to the edges with a rubber spatula. Careful not to smash the batter or it will lose its air and the cake will be flat and chewy. Bake until the cake springs back when touched, or a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack. The cake will collapse slightly as it cools.<br> Using an offset spatula spread the ganache onto the cake layer. Spread the ganache all the way to the edges. If the cake is uneven, use the ganache to make it flat and even as possible. Place the cake in the refrigerator and allow the ganache to harden, about 20 minutes. Then use the offset spatula to make the edges as clean and straight as possible. Place the frosted cake in the refrigerator for about 1 hour to set.<br> When ready to serve, remove cake from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving. Heat a chefs knife in hot water; wipe off excess water and cut cake into the serving size preferred.<br> Decorations: Spread about a 1/16-inch thick layer of the tempered chocolate over a transfer sheet (see note below). Use a chefs knife to cut the chocolate, but not the transfer sheet, to match the size of the cake pieces. Set aside and let the chocolate set about 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the air temperature. When the chocolate has set, lift each pre-cut piece from the transfer sheet and place it, design side up, on top of the individual cake serving &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 66612,&quot;Pork Loin Stuffed with Dried Fruit 1/4 cup golden raisins 1/4 cup pitted prunes, chopped 1/4 cup dried apricots, chopped 1/4 cup brandy or apple brandy 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 shallot, chopped 1/2 Golden Delicious apple, chopped 1 clove garlic, minced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 3-pound boneless center-cut pork loin roast Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees. Infuse the cream: Bring the cream, half-and-half and vanilla seeds and pod to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer to infuse the cream with the vanilla, 10 to 15 minutes. Discard the vanilla pod. Remove the cream mixture from the heat and cool slightly. Meanwhile, bring a kettle of water to a boil. Make the custard. Whisk the egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar and the salt in a large bowl until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is pale yellow and thick; it should leave a trail when you lift the whisk. Pour in the cream mixture in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. Skim off any foam or bubbles from the surface. Pour into ramekins: Arrange eight 6-ounce ramekins in a roasting pan and divide the custard evenly among them. Bake in a water bath: Pull out the oven rack slightly, place the roasting pan on it and pour enough boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until the custards are just set in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. Carefully remove the ramekins from the water bath and transfer to the refrigerator. Chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Prepare the topping: About 30 minutes before serving, sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over each custard. Tilt the ramekins to evenly distribute the sugar and tap out any excess. Caramelize the sugar: Holding a kitchen torch about three inches away, burn the sugar until it turns a deep amber. Refrigerate the creme brulees just until the crust hardens, 30 minutes to 1 hour, but not longer (the topping may start to soften).

But personally, I love Christmas pudding and I think it&#39;s almost worth having another pudding stashed away so you can make this as an after-Christmas treat. Put a pan over a medium heat and crumble in your Christmas pudding. Squash it down a bit with a wooden spoon to help it heat up and get a bit crispy. Fry for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring every so often so it doesn&#39;t catch. In another small pan on a low heat, add your cranberry sauce with a splash of red or mulled wine. Stir in and cook for a few minutes until warmed through. Cook&#39;s Note: If your sauce is too tart for your liking, add 1 teaspoon or 2 of sugar. If you&#39;ve made up a batch of my spiced sugar, then use that because it will be delicious with the cranberry. Once your pudding is warm and slightly crispy and the sauce has heated up, divide 1/2 of your pudding evenly among your 4 glasses or bowls. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of the pudding, drizzle over your hot cranberry sauce, and a good sprinkling of toasted flaked almonds. Divide the remaining Christmas pudding among your glasses and layer again with ice cream, cranberry sauce, and flaked almonds. Finish the sundae off by grating over a bit of nice dark chocolate and dig in before the ice cream melts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 66657,&quot;Caramelized Apple Tart: Tarte Tatin 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) unsalted butter 2 cups sugar 8 medium (about 3 3/4 pounds) Granny Smith apples, peeled 8 ounces Puff Pastry Dough, recipe follows, or store-bought puff pastry dough 4 1/4 cups high-gluten flour or bread flour 1/4 cup sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons water 3 ounces (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted plus 14 ounces (1 3/4 cups) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature Instructions: To make the caramel: Have ready a 10-inch round cake pan with 3-inch sides. (Do not use a springform pan for this; it will leak!) In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sugar and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the mixture is dark amber in color ? it&#39;s okay if there are a few sugar lumps remaining. When the caramel is done, carefully pour it into the cake pan. Don&#39;t touch the cake pan with unprotected hands ? it will be hot! Set the cake pan aside until caramel is cool. (The caramel-coated pan can be made up to 2 days in advance and left, covered, at room temperature.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Core the apples by cutting down, top to bottom, on all 4 sides around the core. You will have 2 apple halves and 2 smaller pieces. Arrange the first layer of apple halves, flat-side down, on top of the set caramel in the pan. (This will later become the top of the tart.) Arrange the remaining apple halves and pieces to form the second layer. Things will be a bit crowded at first, but the apples will shrink down when cooked. Place on a parchment paper-lined, sturdy baking sheet. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the apples are very tender. Meanwhile, on a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry dough into a round 1/4-inch thick. Cut out a 10-inch pastry circle and transfer it to a parchment lined baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. When the apples are done, carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven and transfer to a flat surface, taking care, as the caramel will be bubbling hot. Remove the pastry circle from the refrigerator and prick with a fork 15 times. Gently place on top of the cooked apples. Return tart to the oven and bake for 35 minutes or until the puff pastry is puffy and golden brown. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 to 25 minutes. To serve, you will need a 12- to 14-inch diameter round serving platter and another sturdy baking sheet. Invert both the serving platter and the other baking sheet. Invert both the serving platter and the other baking sheet over the warm tatin pan. Using both hands, firmly grab both baking sheets and quickly flip over the pans ? doing this over the kitchen sink will cut down on any sticky mess. Remove the top baking sheet and carefully lift up the cake pan, using dry towels to avoid getting burned by the caramel. If any apples remain stuck to the pan, remove them with a metal spatula and place them back on the tart. This tart is best served warm. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the flour, sugar, salt, water, and melted butter on medium speed until well mixed, about 1 minute. Work quickly and do not overwork the dough. Transfer the dough to a large piece of plastic wrap, form it into a rough rectangle, enclose the dough in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, put the remaining 14 ounces of butter between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and beat it with a rolling pin, turning as necessary, until softened. The butter should be malleable but not too soft. Set aside in a cool place ? the butter will later be spread on the dough as you start the folding process. Place the refrigerated dough on a well-floured work surface and dust the top of the dough lightly with flour. Using a rolling pin, push down on the dough to start flattening it, and then roll it into a 20 by 30 by 10-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with the long sides running from left to right. (It might feel that you&#39;re rolling sideways, and well, you are.) Carefully brush off any excess flour from the dough. Starting on the right side, and leaving a 1-inch border, slap and spread on the butter, using your fingers, over two-thirds of the rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds; starting with the left side, fold at the butter line as if closing a book, and then fold the right side up and over the top layer. You should end up with a stack of 3 thick layers of dough, each separated from the next by a layer of butter. As you prepare to make the first turn of the dough, keep in mind the importance of rolling the butter evenly along the length and width of the rectangle as you roll the dough. Adjust the pressure on the rolling pin as necessary, rolling harder or more evenly, to achieve a smoother, even, dough-enclosed butter sandwich. To begin your first turn, turn the dough 90 degrees on your work surface so the closed fold is at the top and, rolling lengthwise, roll It into a 20 by 10-inch rectangle. Brush off any excess flour and fold into thirds as above, starting with the left side and ending with the right. At this point, you have finished one turn. Rotate the dough 90 degrees so the closed fold is at the top, and repeat the rolling and folding process. The second turn is complete. After the second turn, or any time the dough is too soft to work with, transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate, covered in plastic wrap, for about 30 minutes, or until the dough is chilled and relaxed. Each time the dough is refrigerated, make an indentation in the dough with your fingertip for each turn completed. Repeat this rolling and folding process, rolling out the dough lengthwise every time, for more times for a total of 6 turns. After the sixth turn, let the dough rest a good hour in the refrigerator. Store the dough, as is, well wrapped in plastic wrap. The dough can be kept refrigerated up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 10 days. If frozen, thaw the dough, still wrapped in plastic, in the refrigerator before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 66658,&quot;Prime Rib of Swordfish 3 pounds boneless, skinless center-cut swordfish loin 1 tablespoon sea salt 2 tablespoons Fennel Spice Rub, recipe follows 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup fennel seeds 3 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons white peppercorns 3 tablespoons kosher salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Set a rack inside a baking sheet. Season the swordfish with sea salt and the Fennel Spice Rub, pressing the spices into the flesh. Tie the swordfish crosswise at 3 evenly spaced places (not imperative but it will hold together a little easier). Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Brown the swordfish on all sides, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes total. Place the swordfish on the rack inside the baking sheet and roast until the internal temperature reaches 120 degrees F, or about 30 minutes. Allow the fish to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before carving. Cut the strings to remove, and carve the swordfish crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly. Watch carefully as they can easily burn. When light brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool. They must be cool before grinding, or they will gum up the blades. Pour the seeds into a blender and add the salt. Blend to a fine powder, shaking the blender occasionally to redistribute the seeds. Store in a tightly sealed glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze.

Evenly spread the dry rub over the entire outside of the brisket. Rub in lightly and dust off any excess. Start a fire in your grill using oak, other hard woods, or oak charcoal. Do not use mesquite in any form. Once the fire has reached the stage where you can hold your hand about 1-inch over the grill to a count of 4, place the brisket fat side down above the coals. Leave for 5 to 10 minutes or until caramelization begins. Turn brisket over and repeat process. Remove from fire. The purpose of this procedure is to set the spices into the meat so that they will not wash off during the cooking process. Place the brisket on an open grill away from the coals and maintain a temperature to where you can hold your hand over it to a count of 12 or place in a closed smoker away from the coals at a temperature of 210 degrees F. Cook for 14 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. During the cooking process, turn and baste the brisket with Salt Lick BBQ sauce often (at least 4 times). If not using Salt Lick BBQ sauce, make sure your sauce has no tomatoes in it, as they will burn and leave a bitter taste. When turning the brisket, try not to use a barbecue fork. If you do, only insert it at the edges. Poking the center will cause the juices to run out and make the brisket dry. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 66674,&quot;Goat Rack and Leg 6 guajillo chiles, seeded 6 ancho chiles, seeded 6 cascabel chiles, seeded 2 bone-in racks of goat (2 to 3 pounds total) bones frenched 2 legs of goat (4 to 5 pounds total) Olive oil 4 tablespoons butter 16 cippolini onions Braising liquid from the Barbacoa of goat shoulder recipe 16 butterball potatoes, \\C\\ size Banana leaves Sea salt 24 long chives Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Stir gently to dissolve, then let stand 5 minutes until foam appears. Turn mixer on low and slowly add the flour, 1 cup at a time. Pour in 1/4 cup olive oil and add salt. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and fold over itself a few times. Form dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil so it doesn&#39;t form a skin. Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Test the dough by pressing 2 fingers into it. If indents remain, the dough is adequately risen. When ready, knead the dough gently and divide in 4 balls. Sprinkle the rounds lightly with flour, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes. This will relax the dough, making it easier to stretch. For Calzones: Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. if you don&#39;t have a stone, simply grease a baking pan. Roll or spread the dough discs into 10-inch circles, leave the dough slightly thick so that the filling will not ooze out. Lay half the prosciutto, apples, Brie, and sage onto 1 side of the dough round and brush the outer edge with egg wash to help form a seal. Fold dough over to enclose the filling and form a large turnover. Roll up the edges with your fingers to close tightly and prevent leaking. Cut a few slashes in the top to allow steam to escape during baking and brush with egg wash. Repeat with remaining rounds. Sprinkle a pizza peel (or prepared baking pan) with cornmeal and carefully transfer the calzones. Bake directly on pizza stone for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown. Let the calzones rest 10 minutes before cutting to allow the cheese to set. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 66684,&quot;Tteok Kkochi 1/3 cup gochujang 1/3 cup ketchup 3 tablespoons corn syrup 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 teaspoons mirin 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 4 cloves garlic, grated 1 pound cylindrical tteok (Korean rice cakes) 8 ounces cocktail franks 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola oil Toasted sesame seeds, for servin Instructions: Soak sixteen 6-inch wooden skewers in a large bowl of water. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir together the gochujang, ketchup, corn syrup, sugar, soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil and garlic in another large bowl until combined. Set aside. Add the tteok and franks to the boiling water and cook, stirring constantly to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot, until the tteok is soft but bouncy, about 2 minutes. Drain. Let cool slightly until ready to handle. If any tteok stick together, separate them with wet hands. Thread 3 tteok and 3 franks on a skewer, alternating between the two and pushing them close together toward one end of the skewer to leave a handle. Repeat until all the franks are threaded then repeat with just the remaining tteok, threading about 5 tteok per skewer. Transfer the threaded skewers to a baking dish or large plate and arrange them in a single layer. Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the skewers in batches to avoid overcrowding and cook, flipping once, until the tteok becomes slightly crusty but without developing color and the franks are slightly browned, about 1 minute per side. Remove to a plate. Once all the skewers are cooked, dip them into the prepared sauce and use a pastry brush to completely coat the tteok and franks evenly. Working in batches, return the skewers to the same skillet and cook over medium heat, flipping once, until the sauce is slightly brick red, about 1 minute per side. Be careful not to cook them too long, as the sauce can burn and become too dark. Brush on more sauce if desired then sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 66685,&quot;Blueberry Soda 20 ounces fresh blueberries, approximately 4 cups, rinsed and drained 2 cups water 7 ounces sugar 1 lime, juiced Carbonated water Instructions: Place the blueberries and the water into a medium saucepan, set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.

Rub meat with the olive oil and then splash with sherry. Continuing to rub beef, then sprinkle the steak seasoning all over the meat. Cover beef on all sides with the fresh herbs, rubbing to coat. Place meat in a shallow pan and allow to rest for 30 minutes. Turn and pat beef with the marinade that has collected in the pan. Allow to rest for an additional 30 minutes. Heat the grill to 500 degrees F. With an 8-inch knife, carefully pierce the meat in the center of 1 end. Cut a hole through that side as far into the fillet as the knife will allow. Turn to the other end and repeat this process, until the hole extends all the way through the fillet. Open the hole like a tunnel, being careful not to break through to the outside of the fillet. Using only small amounts at a time, stuff the cooled Spinach Stuffing into the opening from 1 end to the other. Reduce grill temperature to 400 degrees F. Place the stuffed beef tenderloin on the grill and, turning every 5 to 7 minutes to avoid burning the herbs, cook to an internal temperature of 110 to 120 degrees F. Cooking time for a medium-rare tenderloin is approximately 20 minutes. Once the tenderloin is cooked to your liking and removed from the grill, allow to rest for 10 minutes.

Season with the salt on both sides and place on a rack set inside a sheet pan (technically we use \\half\\ sheet pans for this). Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Combine the breadcrumbs, potato chips, oregano, parsley and garlic powder in a gallon zip-top bag and crush into a course meal. Set up a breading station with three loaf pans: place the flour in the first pan, the beaten eggs in the second, and the breadcrumb mixture in the third. Set a clean wire rack inside a sheet pan to hold the breaded pieces. Unwrap the chicken and blot well with paper towels then dredge the chicken first in the flour (shake off the excess), then dip in the beaten eggs (again, drain the excess), and finally coat with the breadcrumbs before placing on the rack.<br> Position an oven rack in the top third of the oven and crank the broiler to high. Line a clean pan with paper towels and have it standing by.<br> Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in an 11-inch saut pan over medium heat. When the butter foams, add half the breaded chicken to the pan, but don\\u2019t overcrowd. Cook, undisturbed, until crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the clean rack, wipe out the pan and repeat with the remaining butter, oil and chicken.<br> Spread 3/4 cup of the red sauce into the bottom of a a 9-by-13-inch broiler-safe baking dish or pan and broil until the sauce bubbles and begins to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and arrange the chicken pieces in a single layer. Dot the chicken with the remaining red sauce, leaving bare spots to retain some crispy bits. Scatter the fontina and mozzarella over the sauce. Return to the broiler until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, about 1 minute to 1 minute and 30 seconds.<br> Garnish with chopped flat-leaf parsley.<br> Work the garlic, salt and 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil together with a mortar and pestle until a paste forms. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic paste and cook, stirring, until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes.<br> Add the anchovies and the red pepper flakes and cook until the anchovies begin to break down, about 1 minute. (I usually use the back of a wooden spoon to crush the anchovies.) Add the tomatoes and break them up with the back of the spoon then submerge the Parmesan rind in the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, until the sauce is almost dry, about 1 hour.<br> Discard the Parmesan rind or feed it to the dog.

Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 3 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water. Drain, and set aside. Whisk together the eggs and cheese in a bowl. Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove the bacon from the skillet to paper towels to drain, then chop the bacon. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in the skillet and discard the rest. Add the garlic and peas to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly and scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until the garlic is fragrant and the peas are warmed through, about 1 minute. Add the bacon and pasta to the skillet and heat over medium heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Working quickly, add the egg mixture to the pasta and toss with tongs until the pasta is coated in the sauce. Gradually add a little pasta water at a time to the pasta until a creamy, saucy consistency is reached. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle each serving with parsley and more cheese. Combine the eggs, flour, olive oil, salt and 1 tablespoon water in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until a dough forms, about 10 seconds. Remove the dough from the food processor to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball; wrap with plastic and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cut the dough in half and keep one half refrigerated. Cut the remaining half into two equal pieces. (Make sure to keep the unused dough pieces covered.) Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough with a rolling pin as thin as possible (but still thick enough to be lifted off the counter without breaking, about a 10-by-16- inch rectangle; the dough should be paper-thin, but you shouldn\\u2019t be able to see through it.) Dust each dough sheet with flour. Fold the dough in half (using the short ends) and dust the top with flour. Repeat twice more, dusting with flour between each layer to create a stack. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into thin strips (1/4-inch wide). Separate the noodles into \\u201cnests\\u201d and let dry on a lightly floured surface, about 1 hour. Repeat the process with the remaining dough piece, then with the remaining refrigerated dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 66721,&quot;Orange Sugar Fried Donut Holes 1 orange, zested 2 cups sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 container (8 large) store-bought buttermilk biscuit dough Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Place zest, sugar and cinnamon in a paper bag and shake to combine.

Put the pork loin in the container and seal tightly. Brine the pork, refrigerated, for at least 24 hours before using. To make the marinade, remove the stem and seeds from the Nora and ancho chiles. Toast the chiles in a dry pan until just fragrant but no color forms, about 2 minutes. Place the chiles and hot water in a blender and blend on high until smooth. Add the garlic, honey, thyme, rosemary, pepper, olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt and blend again until smooth. Let cool. In a small bowl, blend together one-quarter of the marinade with the butter. Set aside at room temperature. Remove the pork loin from the brine and pat dry. Using a knife-honing steel, hollow out the very center of the pork loin. Place the Bilbao sausage in the hole you have created. Spread the remaining marinade evenly on the stuffed pork loin and allow it to marinate at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pork loin on a roasting rack and roast until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Line the bottom and sides of a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These are going to serve as your handles to remove the bars from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Grease the foil well with the softened butter. In your food processor, grind the graham crackers into a fine meal (you need 2 cups). In a large bowl, combine your crumbs with the sugar, sea salt and melted butter. The mixture should look and feel like wet sand. Set aside a heaping 1/2 cup of the crumb mixture for the topping. Evenly press the remaining crumb mixture into the bottom the foil-lined pan. Pop your crust into the oven and bake until it is golden brown and your kitchen smells of graham crackers, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and allow it to cool on a rack or on a dishtowel on your counter. Melt the milk chocolate in a saucepan over low heat, stirring continuously until fully melted. Do not turn up the heat to hurry this process, you must keep it on low. Alternately, you can microwave the chocolate on low power, stirring after 2 minutes. Once the chocolate is fully melted, it&#39;s time to add the chipotle pepper powder, if using, and stir it in completely. Preheat the broiler. Pour the melted chocolate over the cooled graham cracker crust. Spread the chocolate evenly over the crust with a butter knife. Sprinkle the marshmallows over the chocolate and press them lightly into the chocolate. Sprinkle the reserved crumb mixture over and in between the marshmallows so that you cannot see the chocolate peaking through the marshmallows. Broil the bars 6 inches from the flame until the marshmallows are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Refrigerate the bars until the chocolate is hard, 2 hours or so. Grab the ends of the foil liner and lift the bars out of the pan in 1 piece. Move to a cutting board and cut into 24 squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 66748,&quot;Wok Seared Scallops In Teriyaki Tabasco Butter Sauce 1 1/2 sticks butter Hot pepper sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 24 large scallops Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed and cleaned of stems and blanched 2 red bell peppers, diced Peanut oil Store-bought teriyaki sauce Instructions: Heat wok over high heat. Working in batches, add two tablespoons butter and melt. Add a generous splash of hot pepper sauce, or to taste. Add four scallops to sizzling butter mixture and sear both sides until nice and golden brown, about one minute per side. Season with salt and pepper. Remove scallops from wok to plate. Repeat until all the scallops are cooked. To the wok add the sugar peas and bell pepper and stir-fry for about 2 to 3 minutes until slightly soft yet still crunchy. If they are sticking you may need to add a dash of peanut oil to help out. Pour a large dash of your favorite teriyaki sauce into the wok and return the scallops to the wok. Give them a final toss and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 66749,&quot;Asparagus, Canadian Bacon, and Cheese Frittata: Low Carb 5 large eggs 4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons milk 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest 1 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces medium asparagus stalks (about 8), woody stems trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 4 medium slices Canadian bacon (about 2 ounces), coarsely chopped Instructions: Position an oven rack in the upper part of the oven and preheat the broiler. Whisk the eggs, 3 tablespoons of the cheese, the milk, lemon zest, salt, and pepper to taste together in a bowl. Heat the olive oil in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the asparagus and Canadian bacon, and cook until the asparagus is crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low, pour the egg mixture into the skillet, stirring gently to distribute the fillings evenly. Cover, and cook until the bottom sets, but does not get too brown, about 9 minutes. Remove the cover, scatter the remaining 1 tablespoon of cheese over the surface. Run the frittata under the broiler until the top sets and browns slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside for about 5 minutes before unmolding. Slip the frittata out of the pan onto a cutting board, cut into wedges.

Once you see the oil ripple in the pan add the grated beets, season with some salt and pepper and cook stirring every now and then until they are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer the beets to a bowl and let them cool down a bit. Add the mustard and the vinegar to the beets. Whisk in the remaining extra-virgin olive oil in a slow and steady stream. Add the fresh dill, radishes, shredded cabbage, sliced scallions and relish and toss to combine, taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

Butter a 6-cup gratin dish, and set it aside. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the flour, and mix it in well with a whisk. Cook for 10 seconds, and add the milk in 1 stroke, and mix it in with a whisk. Keep stirring with the whisk until the mixture thickens and comes to a strong boil, which will take about 2 minutes. It should be thick and smooth. Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt and pepper. Allow about 10 minutes for the white sauce to cool. Meanwhile, break the eggs into a bowl, and beat well with a fork. Add the eggs, the cheese and the chives to the cooled sauce, and mix well to combine. Pour into the buttered gratin dish and cook immediately, or set aside until ready to cook. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the souffle is puffy and well browned on top. Although it will stay inflated for quite awhile, it is best served immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66753,&quot;Tricolore Stuffed Pork 1 onion One 5-pound boneless pork loin, butterflied<br> 10 slices provolone piccante 4 whole jarred roasted red peppers<br> 2 cups baby spinach<br> 4 sprigs fresh rosemary<br> 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Peel and slice the onion into 4 rounds. Place in a 13-by-9-inch baking pan and set aside. Using the tip of a sharp knife, score the pork fat in a diamond pattern, cutting about 1/4-inch deep. Unroll the loin so it is completely flat and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Lay the provolone slices over the pork, shingling slightly. Open the peppers so they lay flat and tear or cut them in half so you are left with 8 triangles. Lay the peppers flat on top of the cheese, fitting them together like a puzzle. Distribute the spinach evenly over the peppers. Beginning at one end, roll the pork back up into its original shape with the fat on top. Tie the loin in 4 places with butcher&#39;s twine and sprinkle all over with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Set the pork on the bed of onions and scatter the rosemary sprigs around. Pour the broth into the bottom of the pan and drizzle the pork with the olive oil. Roast golden brown on top, about 50 minutes. Baste the pork with the pan juices and reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the loin registers 150 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Allow the pork to rest for 15 minutes before slicing. Strain the pan juices and serve alongside the pork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]</p><p>&quot; 66754,&quot;Grilled Eggplant 2 pounds firm Japanese eggplant Oil for grilling Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Rinse and dry the eggplants.

Set aside and allow the mixture to cool to the touch, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the crust. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or crush using a rolling pin in a resealable plastic bag with the air taken out until they are evenly sized crumbs. Transfer the graham cracker crumbs to a bowl, add the sugar and mix until evenly combined. Next, pour in the melted butter and fold the mixture until the butter is distributed. It should be the texture of wet sand. Transfer the crumb mixture to a 9-inch pie pan, reserving a few pinches for garnishing the finished pie later. Press the crumbs into the bottom and sides of the pan to form a crust. Some will come up and over the top of the pan. When the marshmallow mixture has cooled, add the vanilla to the remaining heavy cream. Whip the cream by hand with a whisk or in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment to soft peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cooled marshmallow mixture. Transfer the filling to the prepared crust and smooth out with a spatula. Sprinkle with the reserved graham crumb mixture and dot with the maraschino cherries, putting one directly in the center.

Add the salt, sugar, white peppercorns, and dill; rub all the ingredients together with your hands to release the oils in the zest and dill. Lay the fish out on a large sheet pan or glass baking dish. Pack the salt mixture on top of and around the salmon. Cover with another sheet pan and place a brick or heavy can weight on top to press out the moisture from the salmon. Refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours to cure the fish. Scrape the salt mixture off the salmon and lightly rinse the fish under cool water; pat dry with paper towels. The cured salmon will be firm but pliable. To set up the presentation, lay the salmon on a large wooden cutting board. (The whole fish looks great as a center piece on the table, so only slice a quarter of the gravlax at a time.) With a very sharp knife slice the salmon New York Deli-style; paper-thin on a slight angle. Serve the cured salmon with the blini, the dill creme fraiche, and radish-lime salsa on the side. This is an interactive hors d&#39;oeuvre: let your friends attack it, then slice more as needed. To prepare the blini, in a large bowl, proof the yeast in the warm milk for 10 minutes, stirring to dissolve. In another large bowl, sift the all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, salt, and sugar together. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture, melted butter, and egg yolks (reserve the whites) and whisk until smooth. Cover with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours. Just before you are ready to cook the blini, beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold them into the batter. Place a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and brush it with a little melted butter. Pour 1 tablespoon of the batter into the pan, to make pancakes about 3 inches in diameter. Cook for about 30 seconds, then flip them over with a spatula and cook another 30 seconds. Stack the blini on a platter and wrap them in a cloth napkin to keep them warm.

Let cool for 15 minutes in the pans and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.<br> Frost with buttercream frosting In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine all the ingredients. Whip the mixture on low speed for a while. When the sugar is incorporated, turn the mixer speed up and whip until the buttercream is smooth and looks right to you. If it&#39;s too cold, persuade it with a blowtorch if you have one. If it&#39;s too wet, add a bit more powdered sugar. If it&#39;s too stiff, add a bit more butter. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl once or twice to make sure everything is combined.<br> Use immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 24 hours or in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Rewhip cold buttercream before using it.<br> Variation: The water/coffee combo in this recipe can be switched up, but remember, coffee is to chocolate like salt is to beef. Coffee brings out the flavor of chocolate without making it taste like coffee, just as salt brings out the flavor of meat without making it taste salty. The liquid you use can be all water, or it can be a full cup of coffee for more of a mocha-flavored cake. And if you&#39;re feeling really bold, go ahead and use a cup of a dark stout beer instead. Get creative and experiment a little \\u2014 after all, it is a science project. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 66769,&quot;Garlic Mashed Potatoes 1 1/2 to 2 pounds russet or all-purpose potatoes 1/4 cup butter 2 small garlic cloves, minced 1/4 cup cream 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper Instructions: Peel the potatoes and cut in half.

Trim the ends of the zucchinis and cut them diagonally in 3/4-inch-thick slices. (The slices will seem large, but they?ll shrink while they cook.) Cut the peppers lengthwise in 1 1/2-inch-wide slices, discarding the core. Trim off the fennel stalks and cut the bulb through the core in 1-inch wedges. (Cutting through the core keeps the pieces intact.) Peel the onion and slice it in 1/4-inch-thick rounds, leaving the slices intact. Place the vegetables in groups on a sheet pan. Drizzle with the olive oil, add the garlic, and toss gently to be sure the vegetables are lightly coated with oil. Spread the vegetables in one layer on 2 sheet pans. (If they?re crowded, they?ll steam rather than roast.) Sprinkle with the salt and pepper and place the thyme sprigs on top. Roast for 15 minutes. Turn each piece and put the pans back in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, until all the vegetables are crisp-tender. Sprinkle with extra salt and serve hot or at room temperature.

Place cupcake liners in two cupcake pans. Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Stir together the hot water and cocoa powder in a small bowl until smooth; let cool slightly. Stir together the milk and vinegar in another small bowl and let stand until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk together the oil, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in the red food coloring and the cocoa mixture. Alternate whisking in the flour mixture in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just combined. Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes in the pans, then remove to cooling racks and let cool completely. For the frosting: Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese, mascarpone, butter, vanilla and salt with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until smooth and fluffy. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth. Increase the speed to high and beat until very fluffy and there is no gritty texture left from the sugar. Beat in the milk to adjust the consistency if the frosting seems too thick. Transfer the frosting to a pastry bag with a medium round tip. Pipe a circle onto each of the cupcakes. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave or in a double boiler. Transfer the chocolate to a small piping bag and snip a tiny hole. Pipe a spiral on each of the cupcake tops that spans the full size of the top. Run a toothpick from the center point of the spiral and drag to the edge of the cupcake. Do this 3 to 5 times, creating a web. Repeat with the remaining cupcakes. Top with a gummy spider, if using.

For the Chicken: Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer, then set up a breading station. Whisk together 3 eggs and a cup of the half-and-half for the egg wash. (Begin with this amount and whisk more together if needed.) Combine flour and huckleberry seasoning. Set up a bowl, each of: flour mixture, egg wash, and bread crumbs. Evenly coat chicken with flour (not too much or bread crumbs won&#39;t stick). Dip floured chicken into egg wash, then into bread crumbs. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a deep-fat fryer, lightly fry chicken until golden brown. Finish in the oven until completely cooked, at least 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest. For the Macaroni and Cheese: While the chicken is cooking, boil the pasta until al dente and drain well so that you don&#39;t have excess cooking water which will dilute the flavor. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and cook until translucent. Gradually add the flour to make a roux. Cook roux 5 minutes, until light golden in color. Incorporate enough of the chicken broth a little at a time to form a smooth sauce. Simmer for at least 10 minutes to allow the flour to cook out. Add the heavy cream and Cheddar and then season with salt and white pepper. Then fold in as much pasta as you need to acquire the right consistency for macaroni and cheese. Cover and set aside in a warm place. For the Mashed Potatoes: Boil the potatoes until tender and drain well. Then mash the potatoes and stir in cubed butter. Whip milk, salt and pepper into the potatoes with a beater. To Plate: Form a bed of mashed potatoes make a well in the center. Spoon enough macaroni and cheese into the well until so that it just begins to breach the edges of the well. Spoon some of the quince jelly in the center of the mound of macaroni and cheese.

In a large bowl, combine the oats, puffed rice cereal, almonds, 1 cup of the carob chips, dried cherries, sunflower seeds and flaked coconut. Mix until evenly combined. Add the softened dates and their soaking water to a blender along with the cinnamon, vanilla and salt. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, 1 minute. In a separate bowl, mix together the almond butter and 1 1/2 cups of the date syrup. (Refrigerate the extra date syrup for another use; see Cook&#39;s Note.) Add the almond butter mixture to the bowl with the oats and mix together with a rubber spatula or clean hands until evenly combined. When you squeeze the granola in your hands, it should hold together like a wet dough. Firmly pack the granola into the prepared pan. Flatten the top by lightly spraying the bottom of a 1-cup metal measuring cup and pressing down on the granola to compact it as much as possible. There should be about 3/4 inch between the granola and the rim of the pan. Cover with foil and freeze for 2 hours. When the granola has set, remove the foil. Melt the remaining 1/2 cup carob chips with the coconut oil in the microwave. Immediately drizzle the melted carob over the granola. Let set at room temperature or, for faster results, freeze for 5 minutes. Once the carob has set, use the foil overhang to lift the granola from the pan. Cut the granola into 24 bars by cutting it into 3 strips on the 9-inch side (every 3 inches) and 8 strips on the 13-inch side (about every 1 1/2 inches).

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the flours, oats, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Blend the cold butter in at the lowest speed and mix until the butter is in pea-sized pieces. Combine the buttermilk, maple syrup, and eggs and add quickly to the flour-and-butter mixture. Mix until just blended. The dough may be sticky. Dump the dough out onto a well-floured surface and be sure it is combined. Flour your hands and a rolling pin and roll the dough 3/4 to 1-inch thick. You should see lumps of butter in the dough. Cut into 3-inch rounds with a plain or fluted cutter and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with egg wash. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are crisp and the insides are done. To make the glaze, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, maple syrup, and vanilla. When the scones are done, cool for 5 minutes, and drizzle each scone with 1 tablespoon of glaze. I like to sprinkle some uncooked oats on the top, for garnish. The warmer the scones are when you glaze them, the thinner the glaze will be. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 66815,&quot;Peachy Keen Smoothies 1 cup low-fat peach yogurt 3/4 cup peach nectar 1/2 cup fresh raspberries, frozen 1 1/2 cups diced fresh peaches, frozen Instructions: Combine the yogurt and nectar in a blender.

Drain and toss into a bowl with the olive oil. Cool to room temperature. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, puree the pesto, spinach, and lemon juice. Add the mayonnaise and puree. Add the pesto mixture to the cooled pasta and then add the Parmesan, peas, pignolis, salt, and pepper. Mix well, season to taste, and serve at room temperature. Place the walnuts, pignolis, and garlic in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process for 15 seconds. Add the basil leaves, salt, and pepper. With the processor running, slowly pour the olive oil into the bowl through the feed tube and process until the pesto is thoroughly pureed. Add the Parmesan and puree for a minute. Use right away or store the pesto in the refrigerator or freezer with a thin film of olive oil on top. Notes: Air is the enemy of pesto. For freezing, pack it in containers with a film of oil or plastic wrap directly on top with the air pressed out. To clean basil, remove the leaves, swirl them in a bowl of water, and then spin them very dry in a salad spinner. Store them in a closed plastic bag with a slightly damp paper towel. As long as the leaves are dry they will stay green for several days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 66819,&quot;Pasta with Beans and Mussels 3 pounds mussels, well washed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces rigatoni or other cut pasta 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 1/4 teaspoon red cl flakes, or to taste 1 cup cooked cannellini or borlotti beans, drained 2 tablespoons dry white wine 1 cup chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Put mussels in a large pot with a lid.

Set up a bowl of well-salted ice water. Cook the broccoli rabe in the boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes and then immediately plunge in the salted ice water. This will prevent the broccoli rabe from being overcooked and will set the lovely green color. Drain the broccoli rabe and squeeze out any excess water; coarsely chop. Place the broccoli rabe in the bowl of a food processor and puree until it is a coarse paste. Add the pistachios and parmigiano and puree until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning; you probably will need more salt. Add the ricotta and pulse until combined. Taste for seasoning once again-it should be full-flavored, slightly bitter and creamy at the same time. Set aside. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. (If you are making the pasta right after the pesto, just use the broccoli rabe blanching water.) Cook the pasta 1 minute less than the cooking time on the package. While the pasta is cooking, place the pesto in a large skillet and add about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the pasta cooking water; place over medium-high heat. When the pasta is ready, drain and add to the skillet with the pesto. Stir vigorously to combine and cook until the sauce is creamy and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes; add salt to taste.

Meanwhile, put the onions, oregano, peppercorns, garlic, habanero or other cl pepper, vinegar, and salt in a large jar with a tight-fitting lid. Strain the pineapple liquid into the jar. If there is not enough liquid to cover the ingredients, add more water to the pineapple and boil for 20 minutes. Taste and add a little more salt and/or a little vinegar, if you think it needs it. You can use it as soon as it cools, but it will get better as it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 66834,&quot;Orange-Ginger Pork Chops with Dumplings 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 1/4 cup honey 1 teaspoon grated ginger 2 cloves garlic, grated 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 4 bone-in pork rib chops (1/2 inch thick; about 8 ounces each) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 1-pound package frozen vegetable dumplings (about 16) 1 5-ounce package mixed Asian greens (such as tatsoi and mizuna; about 8 cups) Instructions: Whisk the orange juice, soy sauce, honey, ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes in a shallow dish. Add the pork and let marinate, turning occasionally, 10 minutes. Preheat the broiler. Place the pork chops on a foil-lined baking sheet. Transfer the marinade to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced by about half, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, broil the pork until slightly charred and just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside to rest. Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the dumplings, flat-side down, and cook, undisturbed, until slightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water; cover and cook until the water has evaporated and the dumplings are crisp on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Uncover and add the greens; stir until just wilted, 1 minute. Serve with the pork chops and orange sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 66835,&quot;Z Bar Like Butta Zeppoles 3 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice 1 cup sugar 4 eggs 2 cups buttermilk 10 tablespoons melted butter Package active dry yeast, optional Vegetable oil, for frying Maple Glaze, recipe follows 2 cups powdered sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 cup maple syrup Instructions: Combine the dry ingredients in large bowl. Whisk wet ingredients in a separate mixing bowl. If using dry yeast, add it to the melted butter. Stir the wet mixture into the dry mixture, 1/3 at a time, until combined. In a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough vegetable oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 375 degrees F. Drop tablespoons of the batter in batches into the oil and cook until golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the zeppoles to paper towels to drain. Let cool on a wire rack. Dip the zeppoles in the maple glaze, or your choice of powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, caramel, sprinkles, or bacon toppings. Arrange on a serving platter and serve. This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe, in the proportions indicated, and therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results. In a bowl, combine the powdered sugar and vanilla. Whisk in enough maple syrup to create a thick glaze. Add more sugar or maple syrup to achieve the consistency and taste you prefer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 66836,&quot;Matcha Mochi Doughnuts 1/4 cup glutinous rice flour 3 tablespoons whole milk 2 cups glutinous rice flour, plus more for kneading 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon matcha powder 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 cup whole milk 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg, beaten Vegetable oil, for frying 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon matcha powder 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 to 4 tablespoons whole milk, plus more as needed Sprinkles, for topping, if desired Instructions: For the starter: Mix the rice flour and milk in a small microwave-safe bowl until smooth. Microwave for 20 seconds and stir (the mixture will be very thick). Microwave for 10 seconds, then stir. The mixture should now be very sticky (it will pull like a rubber band when stretched upwards with a spoon) and have gone from white to translucent. If not, microwave for 10 seconds more. Set aside to cool slightly. For the doughnuts: Combine the rice flour, granulated sugar, matcha powder, baking powder and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mix with the paddle attachment on low just to combine. Whisk together the milk, butter, vanilla and egg in a spouted measuring cup. Add to the mixer bowl and beat on medium to combine. Scrape in all of the starter and mix until the dough comes together. Mix on high speed until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. (The dough will not clean the sides of the bowl and be slightly sticky to the touch.) Dust your work surface with rice flour and empty the dough onto the counter. Knead until soft and smooth (almost like Play-Doh). Cut 12 (4-by-4-inch) squares of parchment. Roll the dough to a scant 1/2 inch and cut as many circles as you can with a 1 1/4-inch ring cutter. Reroll to cut more circles. Group 6 dough rounds on a piece of parchment in the shape of a circle, with the pieces touching and a hole in the middle. Pat gently to seal the pieces together. Repeat with the remaining circles to get about 12 doughnuts. Meanwhile, heat about 2 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven to 340 degrees F. To fry, slide the doughnuts, still on the paper, into the hot oil in batches of 4. Let fry about 30 seconds, then remove the papers and discard. Continue to fry until cooked, 5 to 6 minutes total per batch. Let cool completely before glazing. For the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and matcha in a small bowl to combine. Whisk in the lemon juice, vanilla and 3 tablespoons of the milk to make a smooth, thick glaze. (Gradually add 1 tablespoon more milk if needed.) If the glaze is still too thick (it should run leisurely from a spoon), add more milk a teaspoon at a time to reach the desired consistency. Dip the top of each doughnut in the glaze and then into the sprinkles if using. Place on a baking rack to dry and harden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 66837,&quot;Roasted Pumpkin Seeds on Watercress and Pear Salad 1 1/2 cups pumpkin seeds reserved from pumpkin, washed, strings removed 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt 3 tablespoons lime juice 1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil 3 ripe pears 3 bunches watercress, washed, large stems removed Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spread pumpkin seeds out on a baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Toss well and sprinkle with coarse sea salt. Toss again. Place pan in oven and roast 20 to 30 minutes until pumpkin seeds are light brown.. Remove from oven and let cool. In a small bowl, whisk together lime juice, mustard, fine salt and fresh pepper. Slowly drizzle in olive oil while whisking so as to form an emulsion. Peel pears, cut each into quarters lengthwise, cut out cores, and halve each quarter lengthwise. Place the pears in a small bowl and drizzle on 2 tablespoons dressing to keep from turning color. When ready to serve, toss watercress with remaining vinaigrette and divide between 8 plates. Place 4 wedges of pear on each plate and sprinkle generous amount of roasted pumpkin seeds over. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 66838,&quot;Mango Sherbet with Tropical Fruit Macedoine 1 pound very ripe mangoes 1 juice orange (about 1/2 pound) 1/4 cup sugar 1 dash vodka Optional: a few drops lemon juice, to taste 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups water 1 large orange 1 small lemon 1 (1-inch) piece peeled fresh ginger 2 blood oranges (about 8 ounces) 2 navel oranges (about 10 ounces) 1 small pineapple (about 14 ounces) 1/2 medium papaya (about 8 ounces) 2 small bananas 4 kumquats 2 or 3 passion fruit 1 or 2 kiwi Instructions: To make the mango sherbet, peel the mangos and slice the flesh off the pit. Puree in a food processor or blender. You should have 1 1/4 cups puree. Juice the orange and pass the juice through a strainer, forcing some of the pulp through as well. You should have a little less than 1/2 cup. Add to the mango puree. Stir in the sugar and flavor, to taste, with vodka and a few drops of lemon juice, if necessary. Pour into a container, cover and chill. Freeze the sherbet according to the instructions for your ice cream maker. To make the macedoine, measure the sugar and water into a non-reactive saucepan. Peel all the zest from the orange and the lemon in very thin strips, being careful not to cut into the white part of the rind. Add the zest to the syrup in the saucepan. Slice the ginger and add it to the syrup. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Chill the syrup in the refrigerator. Peel and section the blood and navel oranges into a bowl and squeeze the juice from the membranes over the segments. Peel, core, and cut the pineapple into small wedges and add to the bowl. Peel and seed the papaya and peel the bananas; cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Slice the kumquats as thin as you can, removing the seeds as you go, and add to the bowl. Cut the passion fruit in half, scoop out the flesh and seeds, and add to the fruit mixture. Add the kiwi, peeled and cut into small dice. You should have 4 cups or so of prepared fruit. Pouring through a strainer, add enough of the chilled syrup to make the mixture soupy. You may not need all of it. Cover and chill thoroughly. When you are ready to serve the dessert, put a scoop of the sherbet into 4 to 6 soup plates and arrange the fruit around it. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 66839,&quot;Caramelized Onion, Walnut, and Goat Cheese Pizza with a Beer Crust 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 pounds (6 large) onions, very thinly sliced Salt to taste Freshly ground black pepper to taste 1/2 cup finely chopped (not ground) walnuts 3 cups unbleached flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 (12ounce) can or bottle beer (beer such as Budweiser is fine) Oil for greasing 1 1/2 cups ( 8 ounces) crumbled soft goat cheese (such as Montrachet) Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet or stockpot over medium heat. Add the onions and a generous seasoning of salt and pepper. Toss to coat well, then cover the pan. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the onions are very soft and are caramel brown all over. After the first 10 minutes or so of cooking, you will have to lower the heat to prevent sticking. The onions need to be cooked slowly over low heat in order to caramelize properly; this will take about 45 minutes. By cooking them covered, you can use less oil to achieve this. Remove the cover from the pan, then add the walnuts. Cook 5 minutes, tossing frequently. Remove the onions from the heat and let cool. To make the crust, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Pour in the beer and mix well. The dough will be sticky. Spread a handful of flour on your work surface and dump the dough onto it. Toss the dough around to coat it with the flour and prevent it from sticking. Knead it 2 or 3 times to make it pliable. Shape the dough into a ball, then divide it in two. Grease 2 baking sheets. Use a rolling pin to roll each ball into an 11 or 12 inch circle. Spread half the onion mixture onto each pizza. Sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese all over each pizza. I like to cook one pizza at a time, but you can cook the pizzas on 2 different oven racks and alternate them halfway through the cooking. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown on top or underneath &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 66840,&quot;Hot Melon Salad 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 1 small red onion, sliced into thin rounds 16 ounces medium-diced melon, approximately 2 cups 1 tablespoon fresh basil, cut into chiffonade 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled 1 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted Instructions: Heat a large saute pan or wok over high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the olive oil, followed by the onion, and saute for 1 to 2 minutes, moving the pan continually. Add the melon and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes or until the melon starts to take on color. Add the basil, salt, and pepper and continue to cook for another minute.

Then heat it up in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Prick the sweet potatoes all over with a fork, put them in a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes. Toss the bananas into the pan and continue roasting for 10 to 15 minutes, until both the bananas and potatoes are very soft. Remove the pan from the oven but don&#39;t turn the oven off. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh into a large mixing bowl. Peel the bananas and add them to the bowl along with 1 stick of the butter, and the honey. Season with salt and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until everything&#39;s well combined and the mixture is fluffy. Spoon into an oven-proof serving bowl and smooth the top. In a separate mixing bowl, use your fingers to rub together the remaining stick of butter, the brown sugar, flour, and pecans until the mixture is the consistency of coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the crumb mixture over the sweet potatoes and return to the oven. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the crumbs are golden. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 66842,&quot;Pork Chops with Creamy Mushrooms 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 center cut boneless pork chops, about 1-inch thick (about 1 1/4 pounds total) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces mixed sliced mushrooms 1/2 red onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1/4 cup brandy or white wine 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 3 tablespoons sour cream 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Steamed green beans, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Transfer to a baking sheet lined with foil and bake until cooked through and but still slightly pink inside, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, and a pinch of salt and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the brandy, and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any brown bits that cling to the pan. Return to the heat and cook until the liquid is almost completely evaporated, about 1 minute. Add the chicken broth, and cook until saucy, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat, stir in the sour cream and parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the mushrooms and sauce over the pork chops.

Let it reduce down until the onions are translucent.<br> Add the scallions and saute them, adding a little warm water to deglaze the pan. Let the scallions caramelize and get color, and then add the garlic. When the garlic starts to get a nice color, add the mushrooms. Stir constantly and slowly add enough warm water to help deglaze the pan. Because you are not using oil or fat to cook, you have to slowly nurse the flavors out of the ingredients.<br> Add the ginger.
