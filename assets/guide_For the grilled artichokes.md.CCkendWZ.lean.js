Squeeze in the juice from the lemon halves and then drop the lemon halves into the pot. With a small spoon, scoop out the furry choke from each of the artichoke halves. Place the artichokes in the pot, cut-side down. Cover the pot and bring the poaching liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat; reduce the heat to medium low to maintain a gentle simmer. Poach the artichokes for 10 minutes, or until the tip of a paring knife slides in easily at the thickest point. Remove the artichokes to a wire rack to drain and cool slightly. For the bagna cauda: Place a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the olive oil, garlic and anchovy paste to the hot pan and stir with a wooden spoon, mashing the anchovy paste into the oil. Cook for about 3 minutes, or until the garlic is fragrant and just beginning to toast. Stir in the butter, one piece at a time, until completely incorporated. Season with a pinch of salt. Keep warm over low heat. To finish the grilled artichokes: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle the artichokes with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place the artichokes on the grill, cut-side down; grill until nicely browned, 4 minutes. Turn the artichokes and grill for another 2 minutes, pressing down gently for even browning.

Brush the bottom and sides of two 8-inch round cake pans with vegetable oil and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl. Whisk the vegetable oil, buttermilk and vanilla in a large liquid measuring cup. Beat the granulated sugar and eggs in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until very fluffy and light, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium and beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, until combined, stopping to scrape down the bowl occasionally. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until the tops of the cakes are firm and spring back when gently pressed and the sides begin to pull away from the pan, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 15 minutes, then run a thin spatula around the cakes to loosen and invert onto the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Beat the butter, cream cheese, vanilla and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in the dulce de leche until well combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until combined, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until the frosting is thick and fluffy, about 1 more minute. Refrigerate until the frosting is slightly firm but still spreadable, about 1 hour. Trim the domed tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if necessary. Cut each layer in half horizontally to make 4 thin layers. Put 1 layer on a cake plate and spread with a heaping 1/2 cup frosting all the way to the edges. Repeat with 2 more cake layers, then top with the remaining cake layer. Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat\\u2014it doesn\\u2019t have to be perfect). Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Reserve the remaining frosting. Mix the cocoa powder and hot water in a small bowl until smooth. Add 1/2 cup of the remaining frosting and stir well to combine. Refrigerate the chocolate frosting and remaining dulce de leche frosting along with the cake. Cover the cake with the remaining dulce de leche frosting. Using a small offset spatula, add swipes of the chocolate frosting in concentric circles over the top of the cake, plus some swipes around the sides of the cake. Use a large offset spatula to smooth the chocolate frosting into the dulce de leche frosting, slightly marbling the two. Run the tines of a fork around the top of the cake in concentric circles. Refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes or overnight. Meanwhile, make the chocolate curls: Run the palm of your hand on one side of the chocolate block to soften slightly. Working over a piece of parchment paper, scrape along the softened side with a paring knife or a wide vegetable peeler to make about 2 cups large chocolate shavings. Freeze on the parchment until set, 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the refrigerator. If the frosting is too hard, let stand until softened, about 15 minutes. Gently press the chocolate shavings into the sides of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec]&quot; 38115,&quot;Garlicky Potato-Rutabaga Mash 2 to 4 heads garlic, depending on size 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt 1 pound rutabaga, peeled and chopped 2 pounds Idaho or Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup whole milk 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cover the chicken with water by 1 inch; add 1 tablespoon of salt for each quart of water used. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. In a large shallow platter, mix the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne until well blended; season generously with salt and pepper. In another platter combine the buttermilk and hot sauce with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces, a few at a time, in the flour mixture, then dip them into the buttermilk; dredge them again in the seasoned flour. Set aside and let the chicken rest while you prepare the oil. Put about 3 inches of oil into a large deep pot; it should not come up more than half way. Add the thyme, rosemary, sage, and garlic to the cool oil and heat over medium-high heat until the oil registers 350 to 365 degrees F on one of those clip-on deep-fry thermometers. The herbs and garlic will perfume the oil with their flavor as the oil comes up to temperature.

Add garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves and salt. Add enough cold water to cover by at least 3 inches. Bring just to a boil on high heat, quickly reduce heat to medium-low, and let simmer, partly covered, skimming any froth from the top during the first 15 to 20 minutes of cooking. A piece this size should be well-cooked but not dried out in 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from stock and let cool to room temperature. When cool, pull meat into fine shreds. Strain and degrease the stock. It will be easier to remove fat when thoroughly chilled. Can be kept, tightly covered, 2 days in the refrigerator, if de-greased at once, up to 1 week if you leave the top layer of fat on it until ready to use. The stock also freezes well. In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded pork with the red cl sauce. Masa: Place 10 pounds of masa in a large plastic mixing bowl. Mix 1/4 cup water with baking powder in a cup held over the bowl with the dry masa until it fizzes, then pour mixture evenly over masa. Add 1/4 cup salt and work masa with hands to mix evenly. Melt 4 cups vegetable shortening in a large saucepan and allow to cool. Pour evenly over masa and knead masa with hands again. When it starts to feel thick and compact (like fudge) it?s ready. Pat down in bowl and set aside. cl Sauce: In a large saucepan, boil chiles and tomatoes together for about 10 minutes or until softened. Drain the chiles and tomatoes and reserve the water (stock.) Set stock aside. Rinse seeds out of boiled chiles at sink. Grind garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and whole cumin with mortar and pestle. Put chiles, tomatoes, 3 additional tablespoons salt and ground ingredients together in blender and blend well. Add 2 cups of the reserved water (stock.) In a heavy, medium-size saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-high heat until rippling. Add flour, stirring constantly until golden. Add strained cl puree to the pan and reduce the heat to low. It will splatter, so be careful. Cook over low heat, stirring often, until the raw taste is gone and the flavor of the chiles has mellowed, about 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded pork with the cl sauce. To assemble the tamales, soak dried corn husks in warm water for about 1 hour until soft. Spread masa mixture evenly onto husk using a wooden spoon. Fill with about 2 tablespoons pork mixture and top with 1 green olive, 1 slice of potato and 1 carrot stick. Fold and tie ends with pieces of corn husk. Steam for 1 and 1/2 hours. To steam: To make a steamer, place a metal rack (such as a cooling rack) in the bottom of a large stock pot or canner. Water level should be below the rack. Lay extra corn husks over rack. Stand the tamales on the folded edge in the steamer (the open edge with be facing upward). First fill the bottom of the steamer, then start stacking tamales on top of one another. Place any extra husks on top of tamales, cover with pot lid and steam for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Replenish boiling water if necessary during steaming, time. The tamales are done when the husk peels away easily from the filling. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 38167,&quot;Gnocchi with Mushroom Alfredo Sauce 1 pound potatoes Kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons cake flour<br> 1/2 ounce egg<br> 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon julienned onions 1 teaspoon minced garlic 3 ounces domestic mushrooms, sliced<br> 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon porcini powder<br> Pinch cl flakes<br> 1 egg yolk<br> 2 tablespoons shaved Parmesan 2 fresh basil leaves<br> Instructions: For the gnocchi: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Whisk the eggs and egg yolk in a bowl. With the machine running, drizzle in the egg mixture until the dough is just about cohesive. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured board and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Set up an electric or hand-cranked pasta machine with the rolling attachment set to the widest setting. Cut the dough into quarters. Dust 1 piece lightly with flour and press or pound it into a thick, flat oval. Pass it through the roller 2 or 3 times. Fold it in thirds, like a letter, and roll it through again, flouring if necessary. Turn the roller to the next setting, and repeat the rolling and folding. After that, simply run the dough through on increasingly thinner settings until you reach the second thinnest setting, flouring as needed. If the piece of dough gets too long to work with comfortably, cut it in half. The final piece should be about 12 inches long. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a clean towel, and repeat with the remaining dough. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using the pasta machine&#39;s fettuccine cutting attachment, cut a sheet of pasta. Swirl the noodles into a nest on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining sheets of dough. For the spicy lobster sauce: Prepare an ice bath large enough to hold the lobster. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Kill the lobster by plunging a knife between the lobster&#39;s eyes and cutting down through the head. Put the lobster in the boiling water and cook until three-quarters done, about 8 minutes for a 2-pound lobster, and up to 12 minutes for a 3-pound lobster. Using tongs, transfer the lobster to the ice bath. Reserve at least 2 cups of the lobster cooking water. When cool enough to handle, shell the lobster and cut the meat into big chunks. Set aside. Heat the canola oil in a large high-sided saute pan over high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cl flakes; cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and a cup of the lobster cooking water; cook until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes and bring to boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are soft and the liquid is reduced, about 20 minutes. Mash the tomatoes using a potato masher. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens to a sauce consistency, about 15 minutes. Stir in the parsley, oregano and lemon zest. Taste and season with salt and pepper. For the anchovy breadcrumbs: While the sauce cooks, heat the olive oil in nonstick saute pan over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the garlic and anchovies; cook for 1 minute. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Fold in the parsley and lemon zest, and season with salt and pepper. To cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 2 minutes. Drain. To finish the dish: While the pasta cooks, stir the lobster into the sauce and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the pasta to the sauce and toss, adding some more of the lobster cooking water to flavor and thin the sauce slightly if desired. Transfer to a large shallow bowl, top with the breadcrumbs.

Wash the rib racks and then thoroughly pat them dry with paper towels and place them on the rack. To make the dry rub: Set a small skillet (I used a cast iron one) over medium heat. Add the fennel seeds, cumin seeds and cl, if using. Toast the spices, shaking often, until the seeds darken a touch, release their aroma, and smoke ever so slightly. Pour the seeds and the cl into a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder and grind until fine (break the cl up with your hands first if using a spice grinder). Add the brown sugar, paprika and 2 tablespoons salt and stir to combine, smoothing out any lumps in the sugar. Sprinkle half of the rub over the ribs and massage into the meat evenly. Flip the ribs over and massage the remaining rub into the meat. Cover the ribs tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. To make the glaze: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the peanut oil until shimmering. Add the peppercorns and cook for 30 seconds. Add the shallots, garlic and ginger. Cook until the shallots soften and turn slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and add the whiskey. Turn the heat back on, and cook until the whiskey has mostly evaporated. Then add 1/2 cup of water, the tamarind, sweet soy and ketchup. Stir together, and reduce the heat until the mixture is at a simmer. Cook until the mixture has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Set aside until you&#39;re ready to use it. When you&#39;re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pull the ribs out of the refrigerator and leave on the counter as the oven heats up. Then, remove the plastic wrap from the ribs. Roast the ribs until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours, rotating the pan halfway through to ensure even cooking. Pull the ribs out of the oven and turn it up to 425 degrees F. Brush the tamarind sauce liberally on both sides of the rib racks, and return the ribs to the oven for about 10 more minutes.

Slice the onions and cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Mix together in a bowl, then add 1/2 cup sherry vinegar and leave to marinate for 30 minutes. Place the shallots into a small saucepan and add the remaining 1/2 cup sherry vinegar. Pick off the tarragon leaves, set aside, and add the stalks to the pan. Bring the vinegar mixture to a boil and allow to reduce by 2/3. Remove pan from heat and start to whisk in the diced butter. Keep the pan warm but do not allow it to get hot as this will cause the butter to separate and will split the sauce. When all the butter has been whisked in, pass the sauce through a sieve into a clean pan and keep warm. Remove the onion and cherry tomatoes from the marinade and place in a saucepan. Sweat the mixture over the medium heat until the tomatoes start to break down. Add approximately 1/2 of the remaining marinade and cook slowly over moderate heat for 30 minutes. While the tomatoes and onions are cooking, take the sea bass fillets and the scallops and season them with salt and pepper. Sear the sea bass fillets in a very hot non-stick frying pan, skin-side down first. When golden brown, remove from the frying pan, place onto a baking tray and cook in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes. Do exactly the same with the scallops. Blanch the baby asparagus and chives separately, in boiling, salted water. Remove from the water and tie the asparagus into bundles of 10 using a blanched chive. To assemble, put 1 piece of sea bass on each plate and top with the confit of tomatoes. Place the second piece of sea bass on top and lean the asparagus bundle against the sea bass. Take the tarragon leaves that were set aside and roughly chop them. Add the tarragon to the warm sauce and spoon sauce around plate.

Chill to let it rest about 20 minutes. With a very sharp knife, cut dough into 3-inch squares. Fold each square in half diagonally, forming an isosceles triangle. Lay triangle on a flat surface with the base closest to you. Starting at the base, cut a 1/4-inch wide band along each side of the triangle, stopping just before you reach the point. On a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, unfold the triangle. There should be a band around the entire square that is attached only at 2 opposing corners. Paint the band with water. Grab the band at the 2 detached corners and cross them over each other, creating a rim around the tart shell and a decorative loop at the 2 corners that are still attached. Press the band into the dough. Prick the bottom then chill again, for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake for 20 minutes in the top 1/3 of the oven until golden brown. Cool on the pan.

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat until it begins to smoke. Carefully add chicken pieces in a single layer, skin side down, to brown each piece. After about 8 minutes, turn each piece and brown them on the second side. When the chicken pieces are a deep brown on both sides, place the onions, celery, and carrots in the pot and cook until deeply browned, about 15 minutes, stirring only occasionally. Add the mushrooms, if using. Add the wine and bay leaves. With a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pot to remove any caramelized bits. Cook over high heat until about 1/4 cup of wine remains, about 5 minutes. Add the water. When the water comes up to a simmer, skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the top. Lower heat to maintain a simmer, but do not let the broth boil. Simmer the broth uncovered for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, occasionally skimming any foam and impurities that rise to the top. The chicken meat will be tender and falling off of the bone. Remove the chicken pieces from the broth and reserve. Pour the broth through a colander lined with a tea towel (or a triple thickness cheese cloth) and set over a large, clean pot (or strain the broth into a large bowl and return the broth to the pot). Discard the vegetables. You should have about 8 cups of broth. Keep the broth warm. Taste and season really well (this is a simple dish that requires plenty of salt and pepper). When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the chicken meat from the bones. Discard the bones. Place the shredded chicken in a large bowl. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water for about 5 minutes, until just shy of al dente, and then drain it through a colander. Pour the warm pasta directly into the bowl with the shredded chicken. Add the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and stir. Add 1 cup of reserved broth to moisten the mixture. Mix well and divide evenly among 8 serving bowls. Ladle 1 cup of warm broth into the bowl. Scatter some Parmesan over each bowl of soup. Pass chili flakes for extra flavor. Serve warm with both a spoon and a fork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 38219,&quot;Marinated Chicken Breast with Arugula 1/4 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon Meyer lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice, plus 1 Meyer lemon, halved, for garnish 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon<br> 1 teaspoon honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/2-inch thickness<br> 2 cups baby arugula<br> 1/4 cup shaved Parmesan<br> Instructions: Whisk together the oil, lemon zest and juice, vinegar, mustard, tarragon, honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt and some pepper in a medium bowl.

The coconut is naturally oily, which helps to preserve the tart for a few days. Make the Sweet Shortcrust Pastry, recipe follows, leaving to chill for 30 minutes before using.<br> Remove the paper and beans, brush with a little leftover beaten egg and return to the oven for 2 minutes. If there are any little holes or cracks in the pastry, just patch it up with any leftover raw pastry before you return it to the oven. Remove from the oven and set aside in the tin while you make the filling. The pastry can be baked a day in advance and kept covered until you need it.<br> For the filling: whisk the eggs, caster sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Add the desiccated coconut and the melted butter, and mix well. Pour the filling into the cooked pastry crust, and bake in the oven until it is golden brown and just set in the center, about 40 to 45 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Sometimes I turn the oven down to 325 degrees F, after about 30 minutes, if it has already turned a good golden brown and I don&#39;t want it any darker.<br> Remove the tart from the oven, and let stand in the pan for about 10 minutes before carefully removing and allowing to cool on a wire rack. Dust the tart with icing sugar to serve. Place the flour, sugar, and butter in a food processor and whiz or pulse briefly. Add half the beaten egg and continue to whiz. You might add a little more egg, but not too much as the mixture should be just moist enough to come together.<br> If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse bread crumbs. Then, using your hands, add just enough egg to bring the dough together. With your hands, flatten out the ball of dough, until it is about 3/4-inch thick, and then wrap in plastic wrap or place in a plastic bag, and leave in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or, if you are pushed for time, in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 38270,&quot;Quinoa Salad 1/2 cup quinoa 1 cup water 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons orange juice 1 clove garlic, finely minced 2 scallions, thinly sliced 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 2 tablespoons raisins 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts 1 orange, peeled and coarsely chopped 1 cup chopped cooked chicken (optional) Salt and pepper Instructions: In a strainer rinse the quinoa under running water and drain.

Remove the top piece of the parchment, to free it from the dough, then place it back on top. Turn the dough over and remove the top piece of parchment. Spread the fig mixture evenly over the dough.<br> Roll the dough into a log using the parchment as a guide (the dough is very soft and the parchment will make it easier to roll). Transfer the log to the prepared baking sheet, brush with the egg wash and coat with the sanding sugar. Cut 20 slits across the log, about 1/2-inch apart. Each slit should go about three-quarters of the way through the log so that it is still completely intact.

Butterfly the flank steak. Cover the steak with plastic and pound it out to about 1/4-inch thickness making sure to keep the rectangular shape as best a possible. Slice the pounded steak into 4 equal rectangles. Lay out the steak piece so that the grain of the meat is going sideways. Evenly sprinkle some grill seasoning, using 1 tablespoon, over each rectangle. Divide the roasted red pepper slices among the meat, then sprinkle each piece with 1/4 cup cheese. Starting from the bottom edge and rolling away from you, roll the beef into a tight log. Repeat with the remaining pieces. Put 2 rolls, back to back, with the seams facing each other and do the same with the remaining 2 rolls. Skewer the rolls with 6 skewers spaced evenly apart so that each skewer goes through both rolls. Repeat with the remaining rolls and skewers. Slice the rolls between the skewers so that each skewer has 2 round rolls, like a stick with 2 lollipops. Season each roll with the remaining grill seasoning. Brush the grill grates with the canola oil. Put the rolls, flat side down, and grill for 3 minutes per side. Transfer the rolls to a large plate and serve with Spicy Yogurt Sauce.

Rub the short ribs with the pastrami rub and let sit in the refrigerator, uncovered, at least 2 hours or up to overnight. The longer you can let them absorb the rub, the better the flavor will be. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Place the ribs on a wire rack set in a baking sheet. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 200 to 203 degrees F and the ribs are fork-tender, about 4 hours. Serve with Braised Red Cabbage and Cranberry Mustard Sauce. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and season with about 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, 7 to 8 minutes.

(You may use between 2 and 3 pints depending on the size of your bowl.) Smooth the top and cover with plastic. Freeze for 8 hours or up to overnight. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Use 1 tablespoon butter to grease a 9-inch round cake pan. Melt the remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a small pot over medium heat, then let cool. Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl. Combine the sour cream, sugar, milk, vanilla and egg in another bowl. Whisk until smooth. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture in small batches, whisking as you go to avoid the formation of lumps. Stir in the melted butter and whisk until smooth. Add the chocolate chips and stir to blend. Transfer the batter to the greased baking pan, then gently tap the sides of the pan so it is evenly distributed. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, then use a knife to scrape around the sides of the cake pan and invert the cake from the pan onto a cooling rack, to cool completely. For the fruit: Stir together the strawberries and sugar in a medium bowl. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. For the meringue: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whip the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until they gain volume, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the cream of tartar and the sugar, then whip until stiff peaks form and the whites are firm and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer the whites to a disposable pastry bag (or sealable plastic bag) fitted with a star tip. Assemble the dessert: When ready to serve, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Transfer the cake layer to a large, round, ovenproof serving platter. (You are building a dessert on top of this cake, so the platter should be larger than the cake.) Remove the sorbet from the freezer and run a paring knife around the edges. Fill a large bowl with warm water and gently lower the sorbet bowl into the warm water to loosen the sorbet. (Be careful not to let any water get into the sorbet bowl.) Invert the sorbet bowl onto the cake so the flat part of the sorbet lays on the cake and creates a sorbet dome. Working quickly, squeeze out the meringue in little spurts to cover the whole surface of the sorbet and cake with little egg white spikes. Have fun with it. Bake until the meringue hardens and browns slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Spoon the fruit around the meringue, then pour the gin around the edges of the platter and carefully light the fruit liquid so it burns a ring around the dessert as you serve it. (Use extreme caution when igniting alcohol.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38293,&quot;Spaghetti with Beet Greens Kosher salt 12 ounces spaghetti 1 1/4 pounds beet greens, stems removed and reserved 1/3 cup olive oil 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons fresh ricotta or ricotta salata cheese, or Parmesan shavings Instructions:</p><ol><li>Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil over high heat and salt it generously.

Split the shrimp along the inner curve, but do not cut all the way through. Spread each shrimp out flat and tap with the broad of a cleaver or knife. (Cutting along the inner curve prevents the shrimp from curling out of shape during the cooking.) Make the marinade by combining in a bowl the ginger, garlic, and oil. Season shrimp with the marinade, cover and chill 30 minutes. Make the batter by measuring out the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl and then adding the liquid ones, singly and little by little, stirring until the mixture is a smooth, thick batter. Fold in the sesame seeds last. Place the batter by the shrimp near the stove. Heat the wok or heavy, deep pot; then add and heat the oil until a drop of batter foams instantly, about 375 degrees F. Lower the heat a little. Then hold 1 shrimp by its tail and dip it into the batter to coat evenly; slip it into the hot oil. Repeat rapidly with the rest of the shrimp and deep-fry them for 3 minutes. Turn the shrimp constantly, with a gentle motion, after they&#39;re all in the oil. When they are golden brown, remove them with chopsticks, a skimmer, or a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Arrange the shrimp on a serving platter and sprinkle a little roasted salt-pepper on top. The shrimp may be done 10 to 15 minutes in advance and kept hot and crisp in a 200 degree F oven. Or decrease the frying time by 30 to 45 seconds; then drain on paper towels. When ready to serve, refry until brown and crisp, about 30 seconds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 38298,&quot;Grilled Shrimp Skewers Marinated in an Orange-Champagne Vinaigrette 2 tablespoons Champagne wine vinegar 1 tablespoons orange olive oil 1 tablespoon Italian dressing mix 1 orange 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined 20 cherry tomatoes<br> Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine Champagne vinegar, orange olive oil, and dressing mix.

If it breaks, that&#39;s ok, just use the brownie pieces to fill in the gaps. Fold the plastic wrap over the top of the brownie and place in the freezer until solid, 4 hours. Place a marble slab in the freezer to chill. (If you don&#39;t have a marble slab, place a baking sheet lined with foil in the freezer; it works just as well.) When ready to serve, place a small saucepan of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add the egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer, and then place the bowl over the simmering liquid, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the hot water. Whisk until the egg whites are frothy, then add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking well after each addition. Whisk in the cream of tartar. Keep whisking the eggs over the heat until the sugar has dissolved and the egg whites are warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Move the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat until stiff, glossy peaks form, 8 to 10 minutes. Beat in the vanilla and mix until combined. Remove the bowl with the ice cream from the freezer. Unwrap the top of the plastic wrap, pop the molded ice cream/brownie out of the bowl and place it brownie-side down on the chilled marble slab. Remove the plastic wrap. Completely cover the ice cream and brownie with the meringue, making sure to seal the edges on the chilled slab. Bring the baked Alaska out to your guests, set it on the table and use a kitchen torch to brown the meringue! Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F; line a 13-by-9-inch cake pan with foil and leave a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Spray with nonstick spray. Add the butter to a medium glass bowl and melt in the microwave. Add the cocoa, granulated sugar and brown sugar, and stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth. Stir in the eggs one at a time, stirring well until mixed in completely after each addition. Add the flour, salt and vanilla extract and again stir vigorously until the batter is well combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth down and even the top. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of the brownie comes out clean with just a few crumbs, 30 minutes. Let cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 38305,&quot;Weighted and Panfried Soft-Shell Crabs with Lime-Garlic Mojo 6 small softshell crabs, cleaned Salt and pepper 1 cup buttermilk 1 cup flour 1/2 teaspoon cayenne Unsalted butter for pan frying 2 teaspoons olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely minced Juice of 1 lime 1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro Instructions: Season the crabs with salt and pepper and place in the buttermilk. Soak for 1 hour. Remove and pat dry. While the crabs are soaking, prepare the mojo: heat the olive oil in a small, heavy saucepan over a moderately low flame. Add the garlic and cook slowly for 5 minutes, or until golden, not brown. Add the lime juice, stir, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, and add cilantro. Refrigerate until cool. To prepare the crabs: In a bowl, mix together the flour, cayenne and salt and pepper to taste. Dredge the crabs in the flour, shaking off the excess. Choose a heavy frying pan (or pans) that will hold all the crabs in one layer without crowding. Place the pans over moderately high heat and add enough butter to create a thin layer (about 1/4 inch) in each pan. After the foam subsides, add the floured crabs and weight them (with bricks or anything you can improvise). Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the crabs are golden brown on the underside. Turn the crabs over, and weight them again. Cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the other side is golden brown. Transfer them to paper towels to drain briefly, dab each crab with some of the mojo and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 38306,&quot;Stir-Fried Mushrooms with Ketchup-Ginger Sauce 1 tablespoon ketchup 1 tablespoon mayonnaise 1 teaspoon peeled and finely grated fresh ginger 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 1 teaspoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon white vinegar 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms Chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for serving Instructions: Stir together the ketchup, mayonnaise, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl.

Blend until smooth, and set aside 3 tablespoons for the pasta sauce. Pour the remaining marinade into a re-sealable plastic bag. Season the pork with salt and pepper and add them to the bag. Seal and distribute the marinade equally on the pork. Marinate at room temperature up to 2 hours or in the refrigerator if longer than that. Remove the pork from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to let pork come to room temperature. Preheat a seasoned cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil for the pasta. Remove the pork medallions from the marinade and give a gentle shake to remove excess marinade. Place on the grill pan. Let cook 4 minutes per side or until cooked through. Remove from the pan and loosely tent with aluminum foil while the meat rests. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in salted boiling water until al dente, about 12 minutes. In a medium saute pan on medium heat, heat the oil. When it begins to swirl, add the onions. Season the onions with salt and pepper, and sweat until tender. Add the garlic and cook another minute. Add reserved marinade and stir. Once combined, add the heavy cream and stir until slightly reduced and thickened, about 8 minutes. Stir in the grated Parmesan, and parsley. Drain the pasta and add to sauce, coating well.

F. Butter two 8-inch round cake pans and dust with flour. Sift the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, buttermilk and vanilla and mix until combined. Dissolve the espresso powder in the boiling water in a mug, then pour into the batter and mix until well combined. Divide the batter between the cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool 10 minutes in the pans, then remove them to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar and egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add in the butter, a tablespoon or two at a time, and continue mixing. Once combined, increase the speed to high and beat until smooth. If the frosting looks curdled and separated, remove one-quarter of it to a microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave for about 10 seconds, then pour back into the rest of the frosting and whip on high. This should bring the frosting together; if not, repeat this process again. Stir in the vanilla and salt.<br> Add the chocolate-hazelnut spread to the frosting and beat until combined. (This step is optional \\u2014 you can just keep the frosting vanilla if you\\u2019d like.) Crumble up the cakes in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup frosting and mix with your hands. You should be able to form the mixture into a ball but it shouldn\\u2019t be too soft.<br> Make the topping: Melt the colored candy melts in the microwave as directed. Assemble the cakesicles in batches: Add a little (about 1 tablespoon) melted candy melts to each pop mold (see box below). Brush the candy around the mold to cover completely. Slide a pop stick into each mold and chill until the candy hardens, about 10 minutes. Add a second coating of melted candy melts if needed.<br> Form 3 to 4 tablespoons of the crumbled cake mixture into a ball, then press into one of the molds, adding more cake mixture as needed to fill. Repeat to fill all the molds, then spread a layer of melted candy melts on top to seal it all in. Refrigerate until set, 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully remove each cakesicle from the mold and repeat with the remaining cake mixture and colored candy melts (remelt them if needed).<br> Melt the white candy melts in the microwave, then drizzle on the cakesicles.

Rub this mixture all over the turkey, including under the breast and thigh skin and inside the cavity. Refrigerate uncovered or lightly covered with plastic wrap. For the cranberry bbq sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook until the onion is very soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and paprika and cook, stirring frequently, 2 minutes. Stir in the cranberries, apple juice, ketchup, light brown sugar, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard, chipotle pepper, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Simmer until the cranberries start to burst, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a food processor and blend until very smooth. Reserve half for serving with the turkey. (You can make this sauce the day before and keep it refrigerated.) Half an hour before cooking, remove the turkey from the refrigerator. Preheat a grill for indirect cooking over medium heat (about 350 degrees F). For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels. Brush the turkey all over with oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Place the turkey breast-side up on the indirect side of the grill with the legs facing the hotter side. Cover the grill and roast until almost done (an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh should register around 150 degrees F), 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Brush the turkey all over with the cranberry sauce. Cover the grill and continue cooking the turkey until a thermometer registers at least 165 degrees F in the thigh and 155 degrees F in the breast, 15 to 25 minutes more. Let the turkey rest 30 minutes before carving.

Pulse, pulse, pulse until the mixture looks like finely grated cheese. Add half of the ice water and pulse again. The mixture should start to come together to form a rough ball; if it still seems dry add the remaining water and pulse until it has formed a rough ball. Remove the mixture from the food processor to a clean work surface and form it into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This can be done a few days in advance. When using the dough, remove it from the refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes before using to allow it to soften up a bit. Dust the dough and a work surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out evenly in all directions. In between rolls it is a good idea to rotate the dough a quarter of a turn and dust it lightly with flour if it feels tacky. This will prevent the dough from sticking to the work surface and help it to roll out evenly. Roll the dough into a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Lay the dough in a lightly greased 9-inch pie plate. There should be about a 1/2-inch of dough hanging over the sides of the pie plate. If there is more than that, trim it with a sharp pair of kitchen shears. Fold the dough underneath itself around the rim of the pie plate and pinch or crimp into desired shape. Fill the dough with desired filling and bake according to the recipe you are using or dock (poke holes all over the dough with a fork) and blind bake. To blind bake: Line the dough with foil and fill with pie weights, raw rice, or dried beans. Bake in a preheated 425 degrees F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, remove the foil and beans and bake for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the pie shell from the oven and cool. The dough should be golden and crisp. Continue with desired filling.

Set aside until needed. Combine the panko and garlic salt in a small bowl and drizzle with oil; toss until coated. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot add the panko and toast until light golden, stirring constantly. Pour the toasted panko into a shallow dish. In another shallow dish, whisk together the egg whites, milk, cornstarch and mustard. Line a jelly roll pan with foil (to catch any juices) then set a large wire rack over foil. Remove plastic wrap from chicken. Put the chicken on a work surface and sprinkle with salt and peppercorns; rub into the flesh. In a small bowl stir together the prosciutto, fontina, blue cheese and chopped basil. Divide the mixture into 6 portions. On each breast, put a portion of the mixture on the bottom half and toward the center. Roll the bottom edge of the breast over the filling then roll up tightly, tucking in the sides. Press firmly on the seam to secure. Roll the chicken in the egg white mixture to coat, then roll in the panko crumbs, pressing firmly. Arrange the chicken on the wire rack in the pan, spacing equally. Let rest for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the chutney: In a heavy 1-quart saucepan add the butter and let it melt over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until tender, and stirring often, about 3 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, raisins, ginger, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, curry, salt, nutmeg and blueberries. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and slightly mash the blueberries with a potato masher. Cover the pan and set aside. After resting the chicken for 20 minutes, put the pan in the preheated oven and bake until an instant-read thermometer reaches 160 degrees F when inserted into the center of the chicken roll, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let the chicken to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and serve topped with the chutney, (no need to reheat). Garnish with basil leaves and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 38347,&quot;Mocha Cappuccino Crepes em Crepes: /em 2 large eggs 1 cup water 2 tbsps.

When water has evaporated and remaining liquid is strained, clear duck fat will remain. Use the fat in this recipe, or pour it into a clean container, cover, and refrigerate or freeze for future use. Place the duck pieces in a large mixing bowl. Combine salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, and quatre epices, and rub mixture over duck pieces. Cut unpeeled head of garlic in half crosswise, stud with cloves and add to bowl. Cover meat with plastic wrap, place a weight on it to press down on meat, and refrigerate for 1 day. (A bottle of Armagnac is a perfect weight unless you drink too much of it during the next 24 hours!) The next day, melt 8 cups duck fat in a large heavy casserole over medium heat. Remove duck pieces from refrigerator and wipe off herb and salt mixture. Reserve garlic studded with cloves. When fat is warm but not hot, add duck pieces to the pot along with clove studded garlic. Put in legs first, bringing to a low simmer. Half an hour later, add gizzards; then cook slowly over low heat for another 45 minutes. Simmer until meat can be easily pierced with a fork. Remove pieces from pot and set aside.; For the garlic puree, thinly slice garlic and slowly saute in the 2 tablespoons of olive oil over low heat until lightly caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes. Use oil and garlic when you puree mixture. For the succotash, heat duck fat in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and bell peppers and saute until softened but still bright in color, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, coriander, red pepper flakes, cumin, and bay leaf, and cook 1 minute. Stir in molasses, lima beans, and chicken stock, bring to a simmer, and cook until beans are done but still firm. Stir in corn, cook for 2 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. If not using immediately, cool quickly over ice to avoid overcooking. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Recipe may be prepared up to 2 days ahead to this point. Reheat over low heat. Stir in tomatoes, adjusting amount to your taste. Add thyme leaves, vinegar, and butter. Taste for seasonings and keep warm. For the smoked tomato puree, heat canned tomato puree in a small skillet until slightly reduced; add a little chopped chipolte pepper or to taste.

Make an ice bath with salted water. Blanch the haricots verts in the boiling water until tender but still crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Immediately shock in the ice bath to stop cooking. Drain the excess water and set aside on a sheet tray. Coat a small saute pan with olive oil and add 1 tablespoon of the shallots and some salt (save the remaining shallots for the sauce). Sweat over medium heat until softened and translucent, about 1 minute, then add the mushrooms. Stir and cook until the mushrooms start to soften, 2 minutes more. Add a pinch of salt and the crushed red pepper flakes and continue cooking until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the haricots verts to the pan and toss to coat. Taste for seasoning and set aside. Put the flour in a shallow dish. Coat a large skillet with olive oil and heat over medium-high until the skillet is hot. Sprinkle both sides of the fish with salt and dredge in the flour. Gently shake off the excess flour and lay the fish skin-side down in the oil. Cook until the outside edges of the first side turn white and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and cook until the fish turns white and opaque, 1 minute more. Remove the fish from the skillet and set aside on plates or a platter. Use a paper towel to carefully wipe out the skillet used to cook the fish. Lower the heat to medium and lightly coat with olive oil. Add the remaining diced shallot with a pinch of salt and sweat until the shallots soften, about 30 seconds. Add the white wine and chopped lemon supremes and cook, stirring often, until it comes to a boil. Add the capers, lemon juice and lemon zest and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the chicken stock and a pinch of salt and continue to reduce at a simmer by half. Add a pat of butter and cook, swirling the pan, until melted, then add another pat. As the butter melts, swirl the pan to fully incorporate. Continue adding butter, one pat at a time, until the sauce is thickened. (You should need between 3 and 4 pats total.) If the sauce reduces too much, adjust with a small splash of chicken stock to thin it out. Season to taste with salt and stir in the parsley. Arrange the haricots verts and mushrooms next to the fish on plates. Top the fish with the sauce and garnish with a sprinkle of fresh parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 38359,&quot;Shellfish and Sausage Stew 1 hard, smoked linguica sausage, about 6 ounces or prosciutto 2 large ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, cut from the pit and julienne 2 to 3 cups well-seasoned fish stock or clam juice 3/4 cup white port wine Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, for garnish 2 pounds mussels 2 pounds littleneck or other small clams 2 red bell peppers 1 yellow bell pepper 1 medium yellow Spanish onion 1 small zucchini, with skin 1 small yellow crookneck squash, with skin Instructions: Wash mussels and clams under cold running water and scrub with a stiff brush.

Whisk together the beer and maple syrup in a 2-quart casserole dish. Add the onion, 4 cloves garlic and 2 sprigs rosemary to the beer mixture; season with salt and pepper. Arrange the chicken skin-side up on top and season with salt and pepper. Cover the dish with foil and set it on a baking sheet. Bake until the chicken is just cooked through, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part reaches 145, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the olive oil with the remaining 4 cloves garlic and 2 sprigs rosemary in a small saucepan; warm over low heat until the garlic is soft and the oil becomes fragrant, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the baked chicken breasts and onion to a plate. Discard the rosemary and garlic; pour the remaining cooking liquid into a skillet and bring to a boil over high heat; cook until reduced by half. Whisk the flour into the liquid, followed by the butter; continue simmering until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 4 more minutes. Season with salt and keep warm. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush some of the flavored oil over the chicken; place skin-side down in the pan and grill until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter. Toss the onion in the remaining flavored oil and grill until slightly crisp and charred, about 5 minutes.

Put the rib racks on a work surface bone-side up. Slip a knife between the bone and membrane, then pull off the membrane. Cut each rack of ribs in half; season evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add the ribs, bone-side up, and sear until brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. Lower the heat to medium, add the celery, carrots and onion and cook, stirring, 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped garlic and tomato paste; cook 2 minutes. Add the beer and bay leaf, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Return the ribs to the pot, add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Trim a piece of parchment paper to fit the pot, then place directly on top of the ribs and cover with a lid. Transfer to the oven and braise 1 hour, then remove the lid and parchment. Continue braising until the ribs are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour more. Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15 minutes; drain. Remove the rib racks from the pot; let cool slightly, then cut into the ribs. Strain the cooking liquid, discarding the solids; skim off some fat. Return the liquid to the pot. Add the smashed garlic and tomato to the pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the clams, cover and cook until some just open, 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and ribs, cover and cook until all the clams open, 10 to 15 more minutes (discard any unopened clams). Stir in the parsley and lemon juice. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 38363,&quot;Croissant French Toast with Soft Caramel Apples 3 large eggs 1/4 cup milk 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch ground cinnamon 1/2 cup sugar 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut in 1/2-inch-thick wedges 1/2 cup pure maple syrup 4 large croissants, halved lengthwise Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Ground cinnamon, for dusting Instructions: Make the batter for the French toast by whisking together the eggs, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon until evenly blended. Cover and refrigerate. Pay close attention while you make the caramel apples - put the sugar in a large dry skillet and place it over medium-low heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar melts and begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Be careful; the sugar is really hot at this point. Still stirring, add the butter, which will foam a little. Once the sugar and butter become a caramel sauce, fold in the apple wedges. Now, because the apples are cooler than the sugar, the sugar may start to seize and harden, but don&#39;t freak out -- keep stirring, once the apples warm up the caramel will smooth out again. When the caramel sauce starts to form around the apples, pour in the maple syrup. Give it a stir and simmer for about 10 minutes until the apples are fork tender. Pull them off the heat and keep warm until you are ready to serve. For the French toast itself, warm the butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. You probably will only be able to fit a couple of croissants in the pan at once, so prepare these in batches. Take a croissant half and quickly dredge it in the batter. The key word here is quickly; the croissants are very soft and will disintegrate if soaked in the batter. Lay the croissants in the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip them over with a spatula and brown the other side. The presentation is like a caramel apple sandwich - take the bottom half of the croissant and put it on a plate, spoon some of the caramel apples on top of that, and cover with the top 1/2 of the croissant. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and cinnamon and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 38364,&quot;Neopolitan Pizza 8 ounces water 1/8-ounce yeast 1/4-ounce salt 1 pound bread flour 1/8 cup olive oil 1/8 cup cornmeal 2 ounces salt pork or fat back 1 onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 16 ounces crushed plum tomatoes 4 ounces tomato puree 8 ounces beef stock 1 bay leaf Pinch thyme 1/2-ounce salt 4 cups sliced mozzarella de Buffalo 1 bunch fresh basil leaves Instructions: Place the water in a large bowl or mixer with a dough hook.

Cover with a clean towel and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. The noodles can be made in a pasta roller by rolling flat sheets and then pulling them through the slicer setting. Traditional Lagman-style noodles are made by slicing strands of dough about 1-inch thick. Roll the strands out with your palms, stretching them longer as you go, doubling the dough cord over on itself as it gets longer. When all the dough has been rolled into 4 to 6 ropes, pour a few ounces of oil into a large mixing bowl. One at a time, coil the dough ropes into the oil and stretch them further by hand until they are about 1/4-inch thick, coiling them out of the bowl. For the soup: In a large pot bring 12 cups water to a boil. In another large pot, heat the oil until it is nearly smoking. Slowly add the meat, star anise, salt, cumin seeds and some black pepper and cook over high heat until the meat is browned, about 8 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, ginger, celery, leek, hot pepper and paprika, and cook, stirring often, until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38387,&quot;The Fontaine Scant 1/2 cup heavy cream 5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped Pound cake, store bought 1 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water About 1 1/3 cups raspberries 2 tablespoons Framboise liqueur About 2 cups raspberries 8 sheets phyllo dough 3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 1 1/3 cups powdered sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped to stiff peaks About 2/3 cup raspberries Instructions: Ganache: Heat the heavy cream in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Place the finely chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate, then slowly whisking until smooth and homogenous. Pour it on a clean baking sheet to allow it to cool. As it cools, it begins to set and thicken. Raspberry syrup: Place the sugar and water in a non-reactive 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. The sugar should completely dissolve. Add the raspberries and allow it to return to a boil. As it boils, whisk thoroughly to break the raspberries and allow them to release their juices. This will cause the syrup to turn red. Remove from the heat. Prepare an ice bath and strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium-size bowl placed over the ice bath. Discard the seeds and any pulp. When the syrup is cool, add the framboise liqueur. (If added when hot, the alcohol will evaporate.) Store the syrup in a squeeze bottle or a bowl covered with plastic wrap until ready to use. To bake the Fontaines, place them on a baking sheet and bake until the phyllo wrapping begins to brown, 7 to 10 minutes. While these are baking, you can decorate the plate. You will need 6 phyllo triangles for each serving. Place 3 triangles in a circle in the center of each plate with the tips toward the edge. Place the whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch star tip. Pipe a dollop (or rosette) of whipped cream between each triangle and top each dollop with a raspberry. Remove the Fontaines from the oven. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and center each on a plate, on top of the triangles. Stand 3 triangles on end to form a tower over the centered Fontaine. The raspberries will help support the triangles. Serve immediately. Jacques? tip: Always store phyllo dough well wrapped in the refrigerator to keep it from drying. If it dries, you will have to throw it away. If the phyllo is frozen, you will not be able to separate the layers. Let it thaw, covered, at room temperature. It comes rolled up and you will want to lay it flat. If you have any slight tears in a layer, you can still use it by ?gluing? it together with butter. If you tear a layer beyond repair, just throw it away. Prepare the cake: Use a 2-inch fluted round cutter to cut 12 small circles from the pound cake. The slices should be about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. Keep the cuts as close together as possible to avoid waste. Line the circles up in rows on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and soak evenly with the raspberry syrup. To assemble the Fontaines: When the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, scrape it into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip and top each cake circle with a layer of ganache. (I use a pastry bag because it is a clean, easy way to add the layer of ganache.) Place 6 raspberries on top of the ganache layer and press gently to anchor them in the chocolate. Place the baking sheet in the freezer for about 15 minutes to allow the ganache to harden slightly. Lay 1 sheet of the phyllo on your work surface. Keep the remaining phyllo dough covered with a clean kitchen cloth to keep it from drying. Use a pastry brush to brush melted butter over the entire surface of the phyllo sheet. It will be easier if you start by brushing one line of butter lengthwise down the center and then fill in by brushing top to bottom from the center toward each edge. Be sure to brush all the way to the edges, where the phyllo is the driest. Place the powdered sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and liberally sprinkle the buttered phyllo sheet with it. Cover with a second sheet of phyllo and repeat with the butter and powdered sugar. Use a sharp paring knife to cut the doubled phyllo sheets in half from top to bottom and from left to right. Place one raspberry ganache cake in the center of each section of phyllo. Fold each side of the phyllo over the cake from left to right and tuck under the edges. Lightly brush the top with melted butter and place on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Repeat these steps using four more phyllo sheets, until all of the cakes are wrapped. (At this stage, the Fontaines can be stored in the refrigerator for a few hours or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap; to thaw, place in the refrigerator for one hour before baking.) To make the phyllo garnish (you should have the garnish ready before you bake the Fontaines): Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lay 1 of the remaining sheets of phyllo dough on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Use a pastry brush to spread about 2 tablespoons of the melted butter over the entire surface of the phyllo sheet, making sure to brush all the way to the edges. Using a fine-mesh sieve, liberally sprinkle the powdered sugar over the buttered phyllo. Cover with the remaining phyllo sheet and repeat with the butter and sugar. Use a sharp paring knife to cut the doubled phyllo in half lengthwise. Make diagonal cuts from the top to the bottom of each half to create thin elongated triangles (1 1/2 inches at the base and 4 inches tall). Bake until evenly golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stay at the oven and watch these carefully, because they burn very quickly after they brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. (Leave the oven on.) Use a small offset spatula or knife to loosen the triangles from the parchment paper once they have cooled. Be gentle, they are extremely fragile. To bake the Fontaines, place them on a baking sheet and bake until the phyllo wrapping begins to brown, 7 to 10 minutes. While these are baking, you can decorate the plate. You will need 6 phyllo triangles for each serving. Place 3 triangles in a circle in the center of each plate with the tips toward the edge. Place the whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch star tip. Pipe a dollop (or rosette) of whipped cream between each triangle and top each dollop with a raspberry. Remove the Fontaines from the oven. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and center each on a plate, on top of the triangles. Stand 3 triangles on end to form a tower over the centered Fontaine. The raspberries will help support the triangles. Serve immediately. In French, fontaine means fountain. When I created these, I imagined the chocolate oozing when the dessert was cut like water rushes out of a fountain. The combination of raspberries and chocolate is a popular one, the bittersweet chocolate balancing the strong flavor of the raspberries. This dessert is filled with contrasts: warm/cold, acid/sweet, crunchy/smooth. The delicate crisp phyllo dough triangles create an architectural quality, giving the dessert an elegant height. It will be easiest if you make the ganache a few hours in advance and let it cool. If you put it in the refrigerator to cool, it will become too hard. Jacques? tip: Always store phyllo dough well wrapped in the refrigerator to keep it from drying. If it dries, you will have to throw it away. If the phyllo is frozen, you will not be able to separate the layers. Let it thaw, covered, at room temperature. It comes rolled up and you will want to lay it flat.

Cut along 1 side of the breastbone, and then down along the ribs; gently pull and cut the meat away from the bone to cut the breast off the carcass. Do the same to remove the other breast. Season the turkey breasts on both sides with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Put a large roasting pan on the stove over medium heat and get it good and hot. Drizzle the pan with a 3-count of oil. Add a few sage leaves and stir to flavor the oil. Lay the breasts in the hot oil, skin-side down and cook for about 5 minutes until the skin begins to set and crisp. Flip the breasts over and push them off to 1 side. Add the shallots, carrots, and handful of sage leaves to the pan and stir to coat with the oil. Sprinkle the vegetables with salt and pepper. Stick the pan in the hot oven and roast for about 30 minutes until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 160 degrees F on an instant read thermometer, and the shallots and carrots are tender and browned. Remove the turkey and the vegetables to a serving platter and set aside. Now work on the gravy: Put the roasting pan over 2 burners, over medium heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. Then gradually stir in the stock, scraping the bottom of the pan to pick up all of the browned bits. Give the gravy a squeeze of lemon and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Season the steaks on both sides with salt, and pepper and rub all over with a little olive oil. Set the meat in a cast iron pan, and broil 4 to 6 minutes per side, or until done to your liking. Remove to a carving board, cover with foil, and let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, crumble the cheese into a saucepan, pour over the cream, and gently heat to melt. Carve the meat and arrange on a serving platter. Pour over the juices. Cook&#39;s Note: if you feel there is too much juice, you can reduce it first. Spoon over a little of the sauce and pour the rest into a sauce jug for passing around the table. Serve with Endives with Oranges or on a bed of watercress. Halve the endives lengthwise. Melt the butter, sugar, and vinegar to caramel in a large saute pan, and then add the wine. Lay in the endive, cut side down. Season the endive with salt, and pepper, cover the pan with foil, and cook over medium-low heat, turning a few times, until very tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. While the endive cooks, cut the skin off the oranges with a knife, to expose the flesh, then remove the sections, holding the oranges over a bowl to catch the juices. Add the juices to the endive, but reserve the sections until the very end. When the endives are soft, uncover the pan, and continue cooking, turning the endives occasionally, to reduce the liquid to a glaze and caramelize the endives. At the last minute, add the orange sections to heat through, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 38398,&quot;Tiakri (Steamed Millet Couscous) 1 pound millet flour 1/4 cup water 1 quart buttermilk 3/4 cup Vanilla Sugar Confectioners&#39; sugar to taste Instructions: Place the millet flour in a medium-sized bowl and dampen it slightly with the water.

Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Remove the zest from the oranges in wide strips using a vegetable peeler, applying only gentle pressure to leave the white pith behind. Put the zest in a very large pot. Squeeze the juice from the oranges and strain into the pot. Combine the salt, bourbon, sugar, peppercorns, tea bags, cloves and 4 of the bay leaves in a very large pot with 2 quarts (8 cups) water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour in 6 cups cold water. Let the brine cool to room temperature. Gently add the turkey to the brine, adding as much cold water to as needed to cover it. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, drain the turkey and pat dry inside and out. Sprinkle the cavity with ground black pepper. Place the garlic, onion and remaining 2 bay leaves inside the cavity. Sprinkle the outside of the bird generously with black pepper. Prepare an outdoor grill with a medium-high fire for both direct and indirect grilling. Position a drip pan under the grate on the indirect-heat side of the grill. Put the turkey breast-side up over the drip pan. Toss 1 cup of the wood chips onto the coals. Cover the grill and rotate the lid so that the vent holes are directly over the meat. To maintain a medium-low smoky fire, add about a dozen pieces of charcoal and another cup of wood chips to the fire whenever the fire dies down. Rotate the turkey about every 45 minutes to prevent the side near the coals from overcooking. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 38400,&quot;Red Sombrero 1 1/4 ounces tequila 4 ounces lemon lime soda Splash pomegranate juice Lemon or lime wedge, for garnish Instructions: Add ice to a rocks glass.

Trim the leeks at the root ends, keeping the leeks intact. Cut the leeks where the light green meets the darker green. Save the darker green section for stock. Split the leeks in half lengthwise, again leaving the roots intact. Put the leeks in a large bowl of water and let it sit for a minute. Rinse the dirt from the insides of the leeks by lightly separating the layers and allowing the water to wash the dirt out. Tie the leeks in 3 places with butcher&#39;s twine to hold shut. Add the leeks to the pot of water and let it come back to a simmer. Boil the leeks until they are very tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer them to paper towels and remove the twine. Separate each leek into 2 halves. In a small bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, mustards, garlic, shallots and salt and pepper. Spread some of the vinaigrette on the bottom of an 8-inch square dish. While the leeks are still warm, remove the outer layer of each; lay the leeks cut-side down in the vinaigrette in the dish. Spoon the remaining vinaigrette over the leeks.

Pour the liquid ingredients on top of the pancake mix. Using a whisk, mix the batter just enough to bring it together. Don&#39;t try to work all the lumps out. Check to see that the griddle is hot by placing a few drops of water onto to the griddle. The griddle is ready if the water dances across the surface. Lightly butter the griddle. Wipe off thoroughly with a paper towel. (No butter should be visible.) Gently ladle the pancake batter onto the griddle and sprinkle on fruit if desired. When bubbles begin to set around the edges of the pancake and the griddle-side of the cake is golden, gently flip the pancakes. Continue to cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the pancake is set. Serve immediately or remove to a towel-lined baking sheet and cover with a towel. Hold in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 38406,&quot;Japanese Pickle Roll (Handroll, Temakisushi) 4 cups sushi rice, cooked 4 takuan, Japanese pickles, cut into thin strips 2 sheets nori seaweed 1 teaspoon rice vinegar 3 tablespoons water Soy sauce, for dipping Instructions: Just before rolling sushi, toast the nori by passing the shiny side over a high flame. The color of the nori will change from brownish black to dark green. (Without toasting, the nori will be gummy and hard to chew.) Cut toasted nori sheets in half crosswise. Lay a 1/2 a sheet of the nori, shiny side down on a counter. Combine the rice vinegar and water in a bowl, and moisten your hands with this hand vinegar to keep the rice from sticking to your hands as you work. Spread about 1 cup of the sushi rice on 3/4 of the nori closest to you, in a layer about 1/4 inch thick, spreading it to the edges. Lay 1/4 of the pickle slices across the center of the nori. Roll gently, using the fingers and palms of both hands. Eat immediately, without cutting, and serve the soy sauce as a dipping sauce. Yield: 4 servings, 4 rolls VARIATION: CONES As a variation, roll the nori, rice and ingredients into a cone shape and serve with dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 38407,&quot;Spring Lamb Stew 2 tablespoons canola oil 5 pounds boneless lamb stew meat, cut into 1 to 1 1/2-inch cubes, preferably from the shoulder, plus bones Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 medium yellow onions, peeled, halved and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices 12 cloves garlic, peeled, plus 2 for toasting, divided 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar 12 small parsnips, washed and thoroughly peeled 12 small carrots, washed and thoroughly peeled 1 cup dry vermouth 2 bay leaves 1/4 cup smooth Dijon mustard 2 quarts beef or lamb stock Olive oil, for toasting 1 baguette, sliced 2 cups curly mustard greens, washed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces, optional 1 cup shelled peas, optional Instructions: For me, small carrots and parsnips symbolize the beginning of the spring season. This stew recipe celebrates that for me. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat a Dutch oven over high heat and add the oil. Season the pieces of lamb on all sides with salt and pepper. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, use a pair of metal tongs to arrange the lamb, in a single layer, in the hot oil. Brown the meat on all sides. Remove the meat and transfer it to a medium bowl. Stir in the onions, garlic, and brown sugar. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the parsnips and carrots and cook until they become slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add the vermouth, bay leaves, mustard, browned meat, lamb bones, and stock. Stir to combine and put the pot in the center of the oven, uncovered. Cook until the meat is tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Just before serving, put a large cast iron pan over medium-high heat and coat it with olive oil. Once heated, add the remaining garlic cloves and the sliced bread and toast on both sides. Remove the toast from the pan and set aside. Remove the stew from the oven and use a large spoon to skim any excess fat or impurities form the surface of the sauce and remove the bones. Taste for seasoning. Stir in the mustard greens and peas, if desired. Serve immediately with toast. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 38408,&quot;Zucchini Rose Tartlets 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed (about 8 ounces) All-purpose flour, for rolling out dough 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest 1 small summer squash (about 6 ounces), cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced diagonally 1 small zucchini (about 6 ounces), cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced diagonally Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Preheat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium to medium-high heat, to aid in a crispy bottom crust while pizza is in oven. Gather your ingredients. Thinly slice the zucchini (think pepperoni sausage) and add to strainer. Season with salt, let drain 15 minutes, then pat dry on towel. In a small bowl, combine spices. Add it to the zucchini and toss to combine. For the sauce: In a food processor, combine ingredients for sauce and puree. For the pizza: Roll and stretch dough on lightly floured surface into a 12- to 14-inch even round that will cover pan. (Place some AP flour in a squeeze bottle for flouring counter to roll out dough. I use this tip at home.) Turn off heat under skillet and sprinkle a little cornmeal or semolina in skillet. Press dough into hot skillet and up sides as much as possible. Reminder: The pan is hot. Brush or spray the dough with EVOO and season with a little salt and pepper or red pepper flakes. Top the dough with sauce, half the zucchini, cheese and remaining zucchini, then place pizza in oven. Bake 10 to 12 minutes to deep golden, brown and bubbly. Use a funnel to fill a squirt bottle with honey and Calabrian cl paste. Run under hot tap water to loosen when using. Hot honey will keep for months in pantry and is great with cheeses for snacking and fried foods as well as pizza, of course. Drizzle the pizza with the hot honey mixture and top with basil and oregano. Serve with Vegetable Antipasti Salad. To a mixer with dough hook attached add warm water and yeast and let the yeast bloom and foam, 5 minutes. Add EVOO, honey and salt and turn on mixer. Add the flour gradually to form dough, then transfer to a bowl drizzled with a little EVOO and cover, let stand 1 hour. Cut dough in half, wrap half the dough and freeze for later use. Roll and press remaining dough on floured surface to 12-inch round. Gather ingredients. Thinly slice fennel. Chop and combine lettuce, celery, onions, parsley and torn basil, arrange on a platter. Combine dressing ingredients (EVOO, vinegar, dried herbs and spices, sugar or honey and lemon juice) in squirt bottle, small jar or bowl, then season with salt and pepper to combine. Slice the peppers into strips, quarter the artichoke hearts, thinly slice the hot cherry peppers. Arrange the vegetables and olives on the bed of salad.

Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Combine the ricotta, milk, egg yolks, vanilla and zest in a separate bowl and whisk until smooth. Beat the egg whites in an electric mixer until stiff. Add the dry ingredients to the ricotta and milk, stirring gently until just combined. Whisk in a small amount of the egg whites to lighten the batter, then fold in the remaining whites. Heat a cast-iron griddle or large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat and brush the surface with butter or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon a scant 1/3 cup of the batter onto the pan and cook the pancakes for 3 or 4 minutes. Flip, cooking until both sides are golden brown. Stack the pancakes and serve topped with the Fig and Pistachio Compote. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and garnish with mint sprigs.

Use a sharp paring knife to slice the rope into 1-inch long slices. Use your palms to roll the slice into an oval shape. Dip your fingers into cornstarch and pinch 1 end of the oval to mold the tail of the dove&#39;s body. Pinch the other end to make the head and beak. Use the back of the paring knife to score and fan the tail section. Push the tail up toward the body to give the sculpture a little more flair. To make the wings: Place a small piece of marzipan into a zip-lock plastic bag. Use a rolling pin to roll the marzipan into a 3-inch diameter circle that is about 1/8-inch thick. Remove the rolled marzipan from the plastic bag and place on the work surface. Use the paring knife to cut oval shapes that are pointed on each end. Cut 2 pieces for each bird. Adhere the wings to the body. The finished bird is about 1 to 1 1/2-inches long. Jacques&#39; tip: The marzipan can be colored by adding a few drops of food color. Work the color into the marzipan by folding it into itself. Make the gelatin: Place the water and sugar in a saucepan. Use a rolling pin to bruise the lemon grass. Place the lemon grass in the water. Add the gelatin. Bring to a boil. Strain the mixture. Let the gelatin cool but not harden. Place the gelatin into an automatic funnel. It is easier to use a funnel than cup with pour spout because you can control the flow of the gelatin as you add it to the mold. Pour about 1/4-inch thick layer of gelatin into bottom of the mold. Let harden. Place the marzipan doves on top of the gelatin layer. Use the automatic funnel to add more gelatin to the mold. Fill so the gelatin covers the backs of the birds but does not cover them completely. Place the gelatin in the refrigerator and let it set. When firm, remove from the refrigerator, fill the mold completely, and return to the refrigerator. Unmold the gelatin. Use a chef&#39;s knife dipped in hot water to cut the gelatin into squares. Place the gelatin square on top of the Lemon Rice shortbread cookie. Serve immediately. Place the butter, cake flour and rice flour in a medium-size mixing bowl. The rice flour will make the cookie crisper and more crumbly because it does not contain any gluten. Use an electric mixer set on medium speed to beat the mixture just until combined. Add the salt, lemon zest and sugar, mix just to combine, add the eggs, mix until dough hold together. Remove the dough from the bowl and pat into a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before using. This will give any gluten that may have developed a chance to relax. If you use the dough immediately after making it, it may be tough and elastic. The dough will keep, well wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for 1 week or in the freezer for 1 month. Thaw the dough in the refrigerator until ready to use. If you want to store the dough already rolled into a tart pan, wrap it in plastic wrap. Marzipan Dove Wagashi: When you are ready to use the dough, remove it from the refrigerator and give it 4 or 5 quick raps with a rolling pin. This softens the cold butter. Use a 2-inch plain cutter to cut the dough into cookies. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool. If you place the gelatin squares on top of warm cookies, the gelatin will melt &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 38416,&quot;Chicken Alla Padulese 4 boneless chicken breasts 1 cup flour 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 clove garlic, chopped 1 cup tomato sauce 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves 20 fresh basil leaves Salt and pepper Parmesan, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Melt the 4 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet and reserve. Brush the interior of a large bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and set aside. Whisk the flour and salt and pepper, to taste, together in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and water well and fold in the ricotta and thyme. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour and whisk well until smooth. The batter should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter; add more water, if necessary. In batches, with a large rubber spatula, hold a colander with medium holes over the boiling water and push the batter through the holes into the water. Cook each batch until they all float, about 1 minute. Using a large strainer or slotted spoon, lift them out of the water, shake off the excess water, and drop them into the buttered bowl. Continue cooking spaetzle, tossing in the buttered bowl to keep them from sticking. Bring the skillet with the melted butter to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the butter begins to brown a bit. (The milk solids will turn golden brown in the bottom of the skillet.)

To a 1-gallon plastic bag add paprika, ground thyme, salt, ground black pepper, basil, and chili powder, and shake to combine. Add the crawfish and shrimp to the bag in batches and shake to coat. Add the crawfish and shrimp a little at a time to the boiling water so as not to stop the boil, and let cook until pink and the crawfish is curled. As they are cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove the crawfish and shrimp to a platter and set aside until they are cool enough to handle. Remove the shells from the crawfish and shrimp and add the shells back to the pot of cooking liquid, and allow to reduce by two-thirds. (The shells of crawfish are removed by cracking the tail with both hands and forcing it back out through the curve of the tail.) Reserve the crawfish and shrimp meat until needed. When reduced, strain the cooking liquid into a bowl. For the sauce: In another saucepan, combine the garlic, scallions, bay leaf, nutmeg, if using, and butter over medium heat. Add flour to make a roux and allow it to cook until blond, then begin whisking in the milk. Into the bowl of reduced seafood cooking liquid, whisk the Cheddar and Gruyere cheeses. Add this to the milk mixture and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make a topping by adding bread crumbs, parsley leaves, Parmesan, Cheddar, Cajun seasoning, horseradish, and hard boiled eggs to a small bowl and combining with a wooden spoon. Fold the crawfish and shrimp into the sauce a little at a time so you can control the amount of sauce to the amount of seafood. (Do not feel compelled to use all of the sauce.) Spread the mixture into a 3 quart casserole dish. Sprinkle with the topping and heat about 5 minutes in the oven until the topping is browned. Serve family style, garnished with parsley sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 38422,&quot;Stuffed Salmon with Balsamic Butter Sauce 1 pound jumbo lump crab meat 1 tablespoon mayonnaise<br> 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon dry mustard<br> 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay<br> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 pound skinless Atlantic salmon or wild salmon fillet, cut into 4 pieces 1/4 pound Brie cheese, sliced<br> Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed Salt and pepper 1 1/4 cups balsamic vinegar<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons minced shallots<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter, cut into 4 pieces 1 tablespoon olive oil Wild rice, for serving Instructions: For the crab cake mix: Gently mix the crab meat with the mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, seafood seasoning and Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl. Form four 4-ounce crab cakes. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. For the salmon: Make a small vertical pocket in each piece of salmon. Place a slice of Brie on the bottom of the pocket, top with 1 crab cake and another slice of Brie. Place the salmon in a large baking dish and add enough water to reach one-quarter of the way up the side of the salmon. Bake until pale and cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. For the asparagus and sauce: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the asparagus just until crisp tender and bright green. Drain and plunge into an ice bath to stop the cooking.

Invert another baking sheet and line it with parchment paper; set aside. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, then the garlic and onion to a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, 1/2 cup basil leaves, 1 teaspoon salt and few grinds of black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the sauce, uncovered, until the flavors are concentrated and the sauce has thickened, about 25 minutes.<br> While the sauce cooks, add the remaining tablespoon oil to a small saute pan over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned in spots and completlety cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat to cool. Roll out and stretch the dough into two 12-inch rounds on a lightly floured surface. Use a 3-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter and punch a hole in the center of each round to make rings. (Set aside the holes.)<br> Put one of the rings onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. Spoon all but 1 tablespoon of the sauce on one dough ring in an even layer.Sprinkle over the sausage, pepperoni and all but 1 tablespoon of the mozzarella, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Gently place the other dough ring directly on top, and pinch the edges to seal in the filling. Use a paring knife, cut 1- to 1 1/2-inch-wide strips into the wreath all around, like rays of the sun. (Be careful not to cut all the way through to the center; the wreath should stay intact and hold its shape once it is baked. You should have about 24 strips total.) Gently turn each strip twice to create a twist, then press the edges down on the parchment. Repeat this motion until all of the strips have been twisted. To make a bow, roll out and stretch the two dough cut-out holes into 6-inch long rectangles. Top one with the remaining tomato sauce and mozzarella. Place the other dough rectangle directly on top and press to seal the edges. Twist the dough with both hands in opposite directions for one full turn to form a bow that will hold its shape. Press the edges down to seal and set the bow on the prepared baking sheet next to the wreath. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with a few drops of water.

Generously coat 18 standard muffin cups (from two 12-cup muffin pans) with cooking spray. Put the oats in a small bowl and slowly pour the milk over them. Stir to make sure the oats are all coated and then let them sit for a few minutes. Put the turkey and bacon in a separate large bowl and add the oats and any extra milk from the bowl to it. Add the parsley, seasoned salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup of the ketchup. Use your hands to mix it all together. Place a 1/4-cup scoop of the mixture in each greased muffin cup. Squirt about 1/2 teaspoon of the remaining ketchup on top of each meatloaf. Use a spoon to smear the ketchup evenly over the top, then use it to nudge the edges of the meatloaves away from the pan a bit (this just neatens them up a little). Bake for 25 minutes, then carefully squirt another 1/2 teaspoon of ketchup on top of each, spreading it carefully with a spoon to cover as much of the surface as possible. Continue to bake until completely cooked through and sizzling around the edges, about another 30 minutes. If there are any large areas without ketchup, go ahead and squirt/spread more as needed. Sprinkle the meatloaves with parsley, then let them sit in the pan for 5 to 7 minutes before serving. Run a sharp knife around the edges of the loaves to loosen them if they stick.

Then turn the mixer up slightly and knead until the dough is smooth. Portion the dough into 2-ounce balls immediately and set aside to proof until the dough is soft and supple, about 30 minutes. For the cream cheese filling: Combine the cream cheese and sugar in a mixer. Clean the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the egg yolks and mix until combined. Add the cottage cheese and combine by hand. For the raspberry filling: Combine the crushed raspberries, sugar and both juice concentrates in a sauce pan and bring slowly to a boil. While the raspberries come to a boil, dissolve the cleargel into 1/4 cup cold water. Remove the boiling raspberries from the heat and slowly whisk in the cleargel slurry until thick. Set aside to cool. Building the raspberry cream cheese kolache: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the dough is soft and plump, use fingers to form a well in each, leaving a thicker wall of dough around the circumference and a flatter portion in the middle. Fill piping bags with both the raspberry and cream cheese fillings. Using the piping bags, fill the flattened portions with a combination of the fillings. When completed, bake the kolaches until golden brown, or 8 to 10 minutes.

Puree on high speed until completely smooth and slightly thickened and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the melted butter and puree until incorporated, 30 seconds more. Let the batter rest in the blender carafe for at least 1 hour at room temperature or refrigerate up to 24 hours. The longer you allow the batter to rest and hydrate, the lighter and softer the texture of the crepes will be; overnight is ideal. Before cooking, re-blend the batter at high speed for 30 seconds. This will reincorporate the ingredients, a vital step in getting an even golden color on the crepes. Wipe 1/2 teaspoon of oil on a large crepe pan or a 10-inch nonstick skillet with a paper towel. You don&#39;t want to see any drops of oil in the pan, just coat with the thinnest layer. Heat the pan over medium heat until hot.<br> Ladle 1/4 cup batter into the pan. Working quickly off the heat, swirl and shake the pan to evenly coat the bottom with the batter. Return to the heat and cook the crepe, reducing the heat if it&#39;s browning too quickly, until the edges are light golden, about 2 minutes. Slide a spatula underneath to loosen the crepe and carefully flip it over. Cook on the other side until a few brown spots appear, 15 to 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, wiping pan with oil each time. Stack the crepes on the plate as you go (you should have about 15 total). Let the crepes cool for 10 minutes before serving or filling.<br> For fillings, we suggest Nutella and bananas or peanut butter and jelly for sweet crepes. Ham and cheese makes a great filling for savory crepes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 38484,&quot;Lemon-Olive Oil Cupcakes with Coconut Whipped Cream One 13.5-ounce can of coconut milk (not light), such as Thai Kitchen brand or Whole Foods 365 brand, chilled in the refrigerator overnight (be sure not to shake or stir) 1/4 cup powdered sugar<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the cupcake liners 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 3/4 cup maple syrup<br> 2 tablespoons lemon zest (about 2 lemons) plus 1/4 cup lemon juice, plus additional zest, for garnish<br> 1 tablespoon lemon extract<br> Fresh berries and mint leaves, for garnish<br> Fresh berries and mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: For the coconut whipped cream: Chill the bowl and whisk of a stand mixer in the freezer for about 10 minutes. If they are not very cold, the cream will not whip properly. Skim the solidified coconut cream from the chilled can of coconut milk and transfer the solids to the bowl of the stand mixer. Do not include any of the coconut water, even if you have to leave behind a little margin of coconut cream (even a little bit of coconut water can harm your results). Add the powdered sugar and whip for a few minutes until the mixture begins to stiffen and turn into whipped cream. Chill the whipped cream in a covered container in the refrigerator. It should firm up even more as it sits in the refrigerator for the next few hours or overnight. For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Increase the mixer speed to medium high and gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar; continue beating until stiff shiny peaks form. Set aside. Beat the vegetable oil, egg yolks and milk in a separate bowl with the mixer on medium speed (no need to clean the beaters). Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest until incorporated. Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and springs back when lightly pressed, 12 to 14 minutes. Dust the cake with the confectioners&#39; sugar and spread a large clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) on top. Invert a cooling rack onto the towel, then invert the cake onto the rack; peel off the parchment. Roll up the cake and towel together, starting from a long side to form a 17-inch-long roll. (You&#39;ll remove the towel later.) Set aside on the rack to cool completely. Make the frosting: Combine the granulated sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. (Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush.) When the sugar has almost reached 240 degrees F, beat the egg and egg yolks in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on high speed until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the sugar syrup between the whisk and the side of the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until the bowl is cool to the touch. Remove the whisk and fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium-high speed, gradually add the butter and beat until thick and glossy. Combine the malted milk powder, vanilla and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl; beat into the frosting along with the nutmeg. Unroll the cooled cake and spread with 1 1/2 cups of the frosting. Gently reroll the cake (without the towel) and trim the ends. Cover with the remaining frosting; dust with cocoa powder. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 38532,&quot;Vegetable Pizza Snacks 2 whole-wheat English muffins, sliced 1/4 cup marinara sauce 1/4 cup diced bell pepper 1/4 cup sliced black olives 4 to 5 fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped 1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the butter, salt and 1 cup water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Add the flour and stir for about 1 minute. (The mixture will immediately form a sticky ball.) Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on medium-low until there is no longer steam. Lower the mixer speed to low, and add the eggs one at a time. The dough will be done once it clings to the paddle in \\spokes\\ as it spins in the bowl. Fold in the manchego and transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Dab the dough into 4 corners on a baking sheet and place parchment paper on top to stick it in place. Pipe 1 1/2-inch-wide rounds on the prepared baking sheet 2-inches apart, then sprinkle a little manchego on top of each. Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the pan and lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake until deep golden brown, an additional 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, combine the mayo and chipotle and set aside. Cut the Muenster to fit the sliders with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter. Divide the chorizo and form into 12 patties, then cook on a griddle or in a medium skillet in 2 batches over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook another minute, then top each with a round of the Muenster and continue cooking until the cheese is melted. Cook the quail eggs in a buttered nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until sunny-side up, 1 to 2 minutes. To assemble, split the gougeres. Top each of the bottoms with a chorizo patty, followed by an egg, followed by a pinch of micro greens. Smear a little chipotle aioli on the top halves and place on place on top of the sliders. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]&quot; 38534,&quot;Chicken Cacciatore Olive oil, as needed 1 (4 to 5-pound) chicken, cut into 8 to 10 pieces Kosher salt 2 large onions, sliced Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 4 garlic cloves, smashed and finely chopped 1 red pepper, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 yellow pepper, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 pound cremini mushrooms, cleaned and sliced 2 cups dry white wine 2 (28-ounce) cans Italian plum tomatoes, passed through the food mill or pureed 1 bundle thyme 3 bay leaves Sauteed Haricot Verts, see recipe Instructions: Coat a large, wide pot with olive oil and put over high heat.

Grease a 10-inch spring form pan. If needed, use a rolling pin with the cookie crumbs in a sealable plastic bag to crush them. Blend the cookie crumbs with the melted butter, press it into the bottom of the pan, and chill. In a mixer with a whisk attachment, place the softened cream cheese and whip it. Add the sugar and continue to mix until blended. Add the flour and salt and blend. Add the yolks and eggs gradually, scraping in between then add the vanilla. Add 3/4 cup of the sour cream and mix in. Take off 2 cups of the mixture and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup sour cream with the cooled melted chocolate then whisk it into the reserved 2 cups of filling. Pour a layer of the vanilla filling into the bottom of the pan about 1-inch thick. By large spoonfuls, alternate the 2 fillings to fill the spring form pan. Using the flat face of an icing spatula, swirl the 2 batters slightly to marbleize it. Bake at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes, then turn the oven down to 250 degrees F and bake for 1 more hour. Then, turn the oven off and let it cool in the oven 1 hour. The cake will still shimmy, but it is done, it will set up as it chills. Refrigerate the cake overnight. Remove from the spring form pan, slice with a hot, dry knife, and serve. Notes about the recipe: I had to make 6 cheesecakes a day when I was pastry chef at the Strathallen Hotel in Rochester New York. Just to rotate them halfway through the baking was a major production. I didn&#39;t have may own baking oven so had to use the ones on our very busy hot line. It was a trick just to keep the guys (cooks) from changing the temperatures on my ovens because they always last them to 500. And then to get them to move so I could kneel in front of the ovens to juggle the cakes around...forget it. So I&#39;d have to yell out \\ROTATE!\\ and get everyone away from the oven while I kneeled in front of them to do the rotation ballet of hot shimmying cheesecakes with dry towels (a hot commodity in kitchens). My knees on my chef&#39;s pans were always dirty and that was why. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 38548,&quot;Apple and Mortadella Stuffing 1/3 cup raisins 4 1/2 cups apple cider 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 1 medium onion, diced 3 celery stalks, split lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch slices 3 tablespoons pine nuts 8 ounces mortadella, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1 cup pitted and coarsely chopped green olives 2 apples, peeled, cored, and diced 6 fresh sage leaves, chopped 6 cups day-old sourdough bread (crusts removed), cut into 1-inch cubes 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To plump the raisins, combine them with the apple cider in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.

Add the sausage, break it up with a wooden spoon, and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned and cooked through, about 7 minutes.<br> Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl, leaving the rendered fat in the skillet. Whisk the flour into the fat and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. While whisking, pour the milk into the skillet and bring the gravy to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 2 minutes. Stir in the sausage and season with pepper. Split the biscuits in half and divide them among plates. Top each biscuit with some of the gravy and serve immediately. To make the biscuits: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with two layers of parchment paper. Set aside.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Rub 2 tablespoons of the butter into the flour with your fingertips until completely absorbed. Work the remaining butter into the flour until it is in even pieces about the size of a pea. Gently stir the milk into the flour mixture to make a loose dough.<br> Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Pat the dough into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds like a business letter. (For a flakier biscuit repeat the folding a second time.) Pat the dough into a 5 by 8-inch rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Use a 2- to 3-inch round cutter to make 6 biscuits, and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Press together the scraps of dough and cut 2 more biscuits.<br> To make the glaze: Mix the cream and melted butter together in a small bowl. Lightly brush the tops of the biscuits with the glaze. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 38552,&quot;Garlic Crusted Sliced Pork Loin with Fresh Succotash 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped fine 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 3 garlic cloves, minced fine 3 pounds boneless pork loin, trimmed and tied 2 cups frozen baby lima beans, or fresh shelling beans Kosher salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 to 6 ears fresh sweet corn scraped from the cob (you will need 2 cups total \\u2013 a little more is ok) 1/3 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon sugar Freshly ground black pepper 2 shakes paprika 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Make the pork loin: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the first 5 ingredients in the bowl of a mini chopper. Process until the mixture resembles a coarse paste. Rub the paste over the surface of the pork and allow the pork to sit for 30 minutes at room temperature, or in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours?leave roast at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting if refrigerated. Roast the pork for 30 to 50 minutes, check temperature with a meat thermometer. The temperature should read 140 degrees F. Remove the pork as soon as it reaches the correct temperature, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes. Make the succotash: Place the beans in a saucepan and cover with salted water. Simmer until tender, 6 to 8 minutes for frozen beans, and 25 minutes for fresh shelling beans. Drain the beans, and using the same saucepan, add the butter and the corn and saute quickly, about 2 minutes. Add the cream, sugar, beans, and salt and pepper. Cook over low heat for about three minutes more. Spoon the succotash into 6 shallow bowls, sprinkle with paprika and parsley. Top each with 3 to 4 (1-inch) slices of the pork loin and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 38553,&quot;Peach Hand Pies 6 peaches (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled, pitted and chopped 1/2 cup water 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 2 teaspoons lemon juice Pinch of salt 2 rounds refrigerated pie crust<br> 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: Combine the peaches, water, vanilla seeds and pod, granulated sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook until syrupy and the peaches are soft and just beginning to break down, 12 to 18 minutes. (Add more water if the mixture is too thick.) Discard the vanilla pod and mash the peaches; let cool. Preheat the oven to 425? F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Gather the pie dough into 2 small compact squares; roll out each into a 12-inch square. Cut each in half, then cut each half into thirds to make twelve 4-by-6-inch rectangles.<br> Arrange 6 rectangles on the baking sheet and top each with 3 tablespoons of the peach compote. Cover each with another rectangle of dough; crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Cut a small vent into the center of each top; brush with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38554,&quot;Green cl Paste 2 Poblanos, roasted, seeded and peeled 1/2 jalapeno cl, stemmed, seeded if desired, and roughly chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves only 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 small red onion, peeled and chopped juice of 2 limes 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and puree until a chunky paste is formed.

Arrange two oven racks evenly in the oven. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spread the sugar in an even layer on the paper. (Leave a small border of paper around the sugar so the sugar doesn&#39;t spill onto the pan.) Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the sugar is hot (an edge will begin to brown). Reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees F. Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When the sugar is almost ready, whisk the egg whites on high speed for 1 minute, until the whites are frothy. With the mixer still on high, slowly add the hot sugar to the egg whites. (I use a large spoon to start and then pick up the paper and pour the sugar in slowly.) Add the vanilla and continue to whisk on high for 10 minutes, until the meringue is at room temperature. It will be very thick and glossy. Using two large serving spoons, scoop 12 very large oval dollops of meringue onto two sheet pans lined with parchment paper. You should be able to get 6 meringues on each pan; space them well because they will expand while they bake. Place 3 candied rose petals on top of each meringue. Bake for 2 hours, until the outsides of the meringues are crisp and the centers are still soft. Set aside to cool on baking racks. Allow to sit uncovered and serve at room temperature. (Don&#39;t refrigerate or store covered or they will lose their crispness.) &quot;,&quot;[Sauternes, Moscato, Riesling, Vin Santo]&quot; 38556,&quot;Gambas Con Ajillo (Shrimp with Garlic) 1/4 cup olive oil 4 cloves garlic, smashed and chopped<br> 1 lb. medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, thawed if frozen<br> Kosher salt and fresh black pepper Kosher salt and fresh black pepper<br> chopped parsley for garnish, optional Instructions: In a cast iron skillet, heat olive oil to medium/high.

Wash the chicken breasts. Keep the skin on until after the chicken is cooked, as it keeps the breasts moist. Place an oven proof saute pan over a medium high burner. Season the chicken breasts with the herbs, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle the flour on a plate or tin and dredge the breasts in flour. Set aside until the pan is hot. Add the olive oil to a hot saute pan and place the breasts skin side down to sear in the juices. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until the skin side is a little golden. Turn the breasts over and place in the preheated oven to finish the cooking, about 12 to 15 minutes. You may need to periodically turn the breast over to ensure even color. This is the time to make the Tomatillo Salsa. Set it aside so you can serve it at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate the unused portion. Test the chicken with a knife to see if it is completely cooked through. If the juice that flow from the meat near the bone is perfectly clear the chicken is ready. If not, put it back in the oven until the juices are clear. When the breasts are ready, remove from the hot saute pan. Place the pan over a burner on medium heat.

In a bowl, combine the egg yolks, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, pepper, Tabasco, and Worcestershire. Blend with a whisk. Gradually add oil, a drop at a time, whisking constantly. As mixture begins to thicken and looks like mayonnaise, you can add oil more generously. Adjust seasonings and store in refrigerator as long as 4 days. In a blender, combine scallions, sour cream, and lemon juice. Pulse a few times to combine, then puree until smooth. Add salt, pepper, tomatillos and 1/2 cup of the Mayonnaise. Blend just to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 38617,&quot;Harvest Focaccia 1-ounce fresh yeast or 2 envelopes active dry yeast 2 cups whole milk, lukewarm 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar 5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped fine 1 tablespoon lemon zest, grated 1 cup red grapes, halved or quartered 1 cup golden raisins 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 egg, beaten well Gray salt Instructions: In a large bowl or the work bowl of an electric mixer, dissolve the yeast in the milk and add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 cup of the flour. Mix well and let stand in a warm place about 15 minutes for the yeast to activate. In a small saucepan, warm 1/4 cup of the olive oil with the rosemary and lemon zest. Add the grapes and raisins, mix well then add 1/2 to the yeast mixture. Mix another 1 cup flour into the yeast mixture with the dough hook attachment. Knead until smooth. With machine running, add the salt and remaining 3 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, kneading until smooth after each addition. Knead another 6 minutes after the addition of the last cup of flour. The dough should remain rather wet to ensure a soft and light bread. Shape the dough into a ball on a floured board and put it in an oiled bowl. Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk about 45 minutes. Punch dough down and lightly sprinkle work surface with flour. Turn out dough and knead lightly. At this point, dough may be wrapped and frozen. To bake, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Oil an 11 by 17-inch baking sheet. Press dough down into a flat disk with the heel of your hand. Using your fingertips, nudge the dough into a rectangle. The dough can be rolled but the pressure will produce heavier bread. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and brush with the remaining olive oil. Let rise again until doubled, 30 to 40 minutes. Make indentations all over the dough by pressing with your fingertips being careful not to puncture all the way through the dough. Bake 15 minutes then remove from the oven and brush with the egg. Sprinkle with the remaining grape mixture then the remaining sugar. Finish with some coarse salt. Return to the oven and continue to bake until golden brown on top and crisp on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Let cool in the pan before cutting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 38618,&quot;Shrimp Dumplings 1/4 pound piece pork fat 1 1/2 cups boiling water 1/2 pound shrimp, shelled deveined, and diced 3/4 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1 medium egg white, beaten 1 1/2 tablespoons tapioca flour 1 1/2 teaspoons oyster sauce 3/4 teaspoons sesame oil Pinch freshly ground white pepper 1/4 cup peeled and finely diced fresh water chestnuts 1/4 cup finely sliced white part only scallion 2 tablespoons finely diced bamboo shoots 1 1/3 cups wheat starch 2/3 cup tapioca flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup plus 3 tablespoon boiling water 2 tablespoons lard, or peanut oil Instructions: To prepare the filling, place the pork fat in the boiling water and boil until fully cooked and translucent, about 30 minutes. Remove, place in a bowl, run cold water over it, and allow to stand for several minutes. Remove, dry with paper towels, and cut 2 tablespoons of fat into 1/8-inch dice. Reserve. Place the shrimp in the bowl of a electric mixer. Start the mixer and add, mixing thoroughly after each ingredient, the salt, sugar, egg white, tapioca flour, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper. Add the pork fat, water chestnuts, scallion, and bamboo shoots. Combine evenly and thoroughly. Remove the mixture, place in a shallow dish, cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. To make the dough, in the bowl of an electric mixer, place the wheat starch, tapioca flour and salt. Start the mixer and add the boiling water. (If an electric mixer is unavailable, mix by hand in the same order, pouring water with 1 hand, mixing with a wooden spoon with the other.) Add the lard and mix thoroughly. If the dough is too dry, add 1 teaspoon boiling water. Continue to mix until a ball of dough is formed. Remove from the bowl, knead a few times, and divide into 4 equal pieces. Place each piece in a plastic bag to retain moisture. To prepare the dumplings, before working the dough, oil the work surface. Soak a paper towel in melted pork fat or peanut oil and repeatedly run a clever blade across it so that the blade stays oiled. Roll each piece of dough into a cylinder 8 inches long and 1-inch in diameter. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Work with one and keep the others covered with plastic. Roll each into a small ball and press down with your palm to flatten it. Press flatter with the broad side of the oiled cleaver to create a round skin 2 1/2 inches in diameter. To form the dumplings, place 1 1/2 teaspoons of the filling in the center of each round and fold in half, forming a crescent or half moon. Hold the dumpling securely in one hand, then begin to form pleats with the fingers of the other hand. Continue to form small pleats until the dumplings are completely closed. Press the top edge of the dumpling between your thumb and forefinger to seal tightly. Tap the sealed edge lightly your knuckle to give the dumpling its final shape. Oil a steamer, place the har gau into steamer, cover, and steam for 7 minutes. Turn off the heat and serve.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38619,&quot;Best Burger Ever 8 ounces sirloin steak meat, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes 8 ounces chuck steak meat, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes 8 ounces lamb shoulder meat, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes Kosher salt 4 ounces grated Cheddar, smoked if preferred 4 hamburger buns Mayonnaise Instructions: Special equipment: Chimney starter, all-natural lump charcoal and kettle grill Pass the meat through the coarsest die of a food grinder. Place the ground meat into a bowl and mix together to evenly distribute the different types of meat. Place in the refrigerator uncovered, for 2 hours. After 2 hours, fill a large chimney starter with charcoal and light. Once the coals are ashy white, transfer to a kettle grill and spread evenly. Set grate over coals. While the coals are heating, shape the meat into 4 patties that are 6 ounces in weight and 3/4-inch thick. Sprinkle each patty on both sides with the salt. Place on the grill and do not move for 2 minutes. Flip the burgers every 2 minutes until they reach an internal temperature of 135 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Watch for hot spots and move the burgers if flare-ups occur. Resist the urge to smash down on the patties. Remove the burgers from the heat to a plate and prepare the buns by placing them on the grill, cut side down for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and place them cut side up on a platter. Divide the cheese evenly between the top buns, set the meat patty on top of the cheese. Coat the cut side of each bottom bun with a little mayonnaise and set atop the meat. Allow each burger to sit upside down for a minute before flipping and consuming. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 38620,&quot;Chicken Nugget Soup 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth or stock 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets 1 pound ground chicken 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs 3 tablespoons grated pecorino 1/4 cup sour cream, plus more for garnish 4 scallions (white and green parts), roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon) Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cups buttermilk Paprika, for garnish Instructions: Heat the broth in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the cauliflower florets and cook until soft, about 15 minutes. Puree the mixture with an immersion blender, leaving it a bit chunky. Alternatively, use a slotted spoon to remove the florets and puree in a blender or food processor. Return the pureed cauliflower to the pot. Combine the ground chicken, breadcrumbs, pecorino, 1 tablespoon sour cream, half of the scallions, the garlic, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Mix to combine. Form the mixture into 25 small, flat oblong-shaped nuggets. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the nuggets and cook, shaking the pan, until browned all over, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the skillet. Bring the cauliflower puree up to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest. Add the nuggets and cover. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the nuggets are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Ladle 1 cup of the hot soup into a medium bowl. Whisk the remaining 3 tablespoons sour cream into the soup, and then pour the mixture back into the pot. Stir in the buttermilk and the remaining scallions. Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle with paprika. Caution: When blending hot liquids, first let cool for 5 minutes or so, then transfer to a blender, filling only halfway. Put the lid on, leaving one corner open; this will prevent the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters and pulse until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 38621,&quot;Reuben Wafflewich 2 pieces pumpernickel rye bread 3 tablespoons Thousand Island dressing<br> 2 slices Swiss cheese<br> 4 slices pastrami<br> 1/4 cup sauerkraut<br> 2 tablespoons butter (salted or unsalted) Potato chips, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat a waffle maker on medium-low heat.

Turn off the heat just before the grits are done. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs. To temper the eggs before adding them to the hot grits, throw a couple of spoonfuls of the hot grits into the eggs. Begin stirring immediately and continue stirring until the mixture is well combined. Pour the egg mixture into the grits. Stir constantly to incorporate the eggs into the grits. Add the butter and stir until melted. Next, add the cheese and stir until melted. Add the cayenne and garlic and stir well to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt or cayenne if necessary. You could also add more cheese if you think that will bring happiness to your life, but keep in mind that some cheeses increase the salt content more than others. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and pour the grits into the dish. Bake until the grits are hot and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. The grits will become firmer as they cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 38624,&quot;Easy Apple Meringue Pie 1 stick cold salted butter 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon sugar 1/4 cup ice water 1 pound McIntosh apples, peeled and chopped 1 pound Fuji apples, peeled and chopped 1 pound Granny Smith apples, peeled and chopped 1/2 cup sugar Grated zest and juice of 1/2 lemon 1 teaspoon apple pie spice 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons salted butter, cut into small pieces 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/3 cup sugar Instructions: Make the crust: Grate the butter on the large holes of a box grater onto a sheet of wax paper and freeze until very hard, at least 20 minutes. Stir the flour and sugar in a medium bowl, then stir in the frozen butter with a fork. Stir in the ice water, then knead the dough into a shaggy ball. Turn out onto a floured surface and flatten into a disk with a rolling pin. Fold in half left to right and then top to bottom. Roll out into a 12-inch round, dusting with flour as needed. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate and gently press into the pan. Crimp the edges, creating a tall rim to keep in all the apple juices. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Make the filling: Position racks in the middle and lower third of the oven and place a foil-lined baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any drips; preheat to 375 degrees F. Toss the apples, sugar, lemon zest and juice and pie spice in a large bowl. Sprinkle the flour on top and toss to combine. Spoon the filling into the pie shell and gently pack evenly with your hands; dot with the butter. Cover the top with a round of parchment paper and press to adhere. Bake the pie on the middle oven rack until the apples are tender and bubbling and the crust is browned, about 1 1/2 hours. Let stand while you make the meringue. (You want the pie to still be hot when you add the meringue.) Leave the oven on. Make the meringue: Whip the egg whites and cream of tartar with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks are just forming, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high; gradually beat in the sugar until the meringue is glossy and stiff peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. Spread the meringue over the hot pie filling all the way to the crust; make swoops with the back of a spoon. Bake until the meringue is lightly browned in spots, 5 to 7 minutes (do not overbake). Transfer to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38625,&quot;Herbes De Provence Roasted Potatoes 24 ounces golden peewee potatoes, halved if large 1 medium onion, halved and sliced<br> 1/3 cup olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon herbes de Provence<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Set aside. Line a large work surface with parchment paper and lightly flour the paper. Roll out one ball of Pie Dough into a 12-inch circle. Gently roll the dough up around your rolling pin and transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Unroll the pastry over the plate. (Alternatively, fold the pastry in half and then again in quarters, transfer to the pie plate and unfold.) Gently fit the pastry into the plate and up the sides. Tuck the edges under the side of the pie plate and trim.<br> Transfer the apple/strawberry mixture to the lined pie plate and evenly distribute. Place the filled pie plate in the fridge while you complete the next step.<br> For the woven basket: Roll out a ball of dough to a 14-by-10-inch rectangle. Use a ruler and a sharp knife to cut fifteen 14-by-1/2-inch-long strips of dough. Braid three of the pastry strips together. Your finished braid will be approximately 10 inches long. Repeat this process with the other strips until you have five braids.<br> Remove the pie from the fridge. Use your ruler to measure 3 1/2 inches up from the bottom of the pie plate and mark the edge of the pie. Dampen around the edges of the bottom half of the pie with water to ensure that the pastry will adhere. Gently transfer one braid to the pie to cover your mark. Add the other four braids one at a time, moving down the pie and slightly overlapping the rows, until all five braids are in place. Use your knife to trim any excess braid to 1 inch beyond the edge of the pie. Tuck the excess pastry under the rim of the pie plate.<br> For the basket handle: Using leftover dough from your braid rollout, roll out four pieces of dough to approximately 12 inches in length and 1/2 inch in diameter. Twist two pieces of the dough together to make a rope. Repeat this process for the other two pieces of dough. Dampen the edge of the top half of the pie with water and attach one rope to each side of the pie. The ropes should meet at the top center of the pie. Curl the bottom of each rope decoratively around the basket edge.<br> To create the Easter eggs: Roll out another ball of dough to a 14-by-10-inch rectangle. Cut five egg shapes with a 3-inch egg cutter. To color the dough, use either gel or liquid food coloring mixed with a small amount of water. Apply with a small paint brush (available in craft stores). Paint each egg a different color (pastel or jewel tones work best). To add sparkle to your eggs, after painting and while the dough is still slightly damp, sprinkle each egg with a coordinating colored sanding sugar. Set aside to dry.<br> To create the Easter bunnies and bow: Cut three bunny heads with a 3-inch bunny head cutter from the same batch of dough. Use a 3/4-inch round cutter to cut six circles. Use a 1-inch diamond cutter to cut six diamonds. Use a ruler and sharp knife to cut one strip of pastry, 16 inches by 1/2 inch. Cut an inverted v-shape into both ends of the strip. Cut another strip of pastry, 1 inch by 1/2 inch.<br> Using small pieces of dough, roll nine balls of dough for the eyes and noses. Use pink food coloring to paint the six diamonds, three of the small round balls and the two strips of pastry. Use black food coloring to paint the remaining six small round balls. To assemble the bunny: Dampen the back of the diamond shapes with water and place them in the center of the bunny ears. Dampen the circles and place two circles along the cheek line of each bunny&#39;s face. Dampen the space above the cheeks of each bunny and place the eyes and nose. Use your knife to score three lines on each cheek to create the whiskers.<br> To assemble the bow: Lay the longer strip of pastry in front of you horizontally. Mark the center of the pastry with a knife. Fold the left side of the strip in and down over the center. Fold in the right side so it criss-crosses over the left side. Pinch the pastry at the spot where the two pieces overlap in the center. Dampen the small strip of pastry and lay it over the area that you have pinched. Press gently to adhere.<br> To create the flowers: Use 1/2-inch and 1-inch flower cookie cutters to cut flower shapes for the front and handle of the basket.

Dampen the back of the bow and gentle adhere it to the front of the basket.<br> Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the Easter eggs and bunnies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.<br> Bake for approximately 10 minutes, or until the faces of the bunnies are slightly browned. Allow them to cool. Raise the oven temperature to 425 degrees F.<br> Bake the pie for 12 minutes. Then, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until the pie is golden and the filling bubbles thickly, another 60 to 70 minutes. Let cool for at least 2 hours.<br> Use a spoon to gently depress the filling under the top edge of the basket. Slide the eggs partially under the top edge of the basket and arrange. Place the bunnies decoratively above the eggs.<br> For the pie dough: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with a metal blade until combined, 2 to 3 times. Scatter the butter and shortening over the flour mixture. Pulse 4 to 5 times until the mixtures resembles small pebbles with a few larger pieces. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of the ice water over top. Pulse until the mixture starts to clump and comes together, 6 to 8 times.

Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, trim the cauliflower florets, cutting away as much stem as possible. In three batches, break up the florets into a food processor and pulse until the texture resembles that of couscous. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. At the first wisp of smoke from the oil, add the onions, and stir to coat. Continue cooking the onions, stirring frequently, until the edges are golden brown and the onions have softened, about 6 minutes. Add the almonds, raisins, capers, garlic, lemon zest and red pepper flakes, and cook, stirring, until the almonds are golden, about 3 minutes. Add the cauliflower to the skillet, and stir to combine. Add 1 teaspoon salt, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the cauliflower has softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon the cauliflower into a large serving bowl, garnish with parsley and season to taste with salt. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 38649,&quot;Spice-Rubbed Salmon with Herb Sauce 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds 2 teaspoons sugar Kosher salt 1 3-pound piece skin-on salmon fillet 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 cups fresh parsley 1 1/2 cups fresh chervil 1/4 cup fresh chives 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Make the salmon: Pulse the coriander and fennel seeds in a spice grinder until coarsely ground. Transfer all but 1 teaspoon of the spice mixture to a small bowl and stir in the sugar and 2 teaspoons salt (reserve the remaining 1 teaspoon spice mixture for the sauce). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place the salmon skin-side down on the foil. Rub the salmon with the olive oil, then sprinkle with the sugar-spice mixture. Refrigerate, uncovered, 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the herb sauce: Puree the parsley, chervil, chives, lemon zest and juice and the reserved 1 teaspoon spice mixture in a blender until a coarse paste forms. With the machine running, gradually add the olive oil and 1/4 cup cold water and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the broiler. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels. Broil the salmon until the top is browned and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 110?, 9 to 11 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes on the pan. Transfer the salmon to a serving platter with 2 large spatulas, removing the skin. Serve with the herb sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 38650,&quot;Bibingka 1/4 cup warm water 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 cup plus 1/8 teaspoon granulated sugar 1 3/4 cups Thai rice flour, preferably Erawan 1/4 cup mochiko (sweet rice flour) 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt One 13.5-ounce can coconut milk One 16-ounce package frozen banana leaves, thawed, or 3 fresh banana leaves 2 large eggs, beaten 3 ounces Edam cheese, rind removed and discarded, coarsely shredded 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon coconut sugar Instructions: Combine the warm water, yeast and 1/8 teaspoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Stir and let the yeast bloom until\\u202ffoamy, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Whisk together both rice flours with the salt and the remaining 1 cup sugar in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture and coconut milk. Whisk until smooth and the consistency of a thick pancake batter. Place the bowl in a warm place until the batter begins to lighten, bubble and almost double in volume, about 3 hours. (This can take longer depending on the temperature.) Wipe clean both sides of each banana leaf with a damp towel, removing any dirt. Trace a 7-inch bowl with a very sharp knife on the banana leaves to create six 7-inch rounds, avoiding any tears or holes in the leaves. Heat each round directly over a low flame or with a culinary torch until pliable and slightly darkened, about 10 seconds per side. Line each cup of a 6-cup jumbo muffin pan with a banana leaf round and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Once the batter is light and bubbly, whisk in the eggs. Fill each lined cup of the muffin pan slightly more than three-fourths of the way (a scant 3/4 cup per bibingka). Top each with 2 heaping tablespoons of shredded Edam cheese. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of each bibingka comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and heat the broiler. Brush the top of each bibingka with melted butter then sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon of coconut sugar. Broil on the middle rack with the oven door open, moving the muffin pan continuously, until the tops are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool in the muffin pan for 5 minutes then remove each bibingka to a wire rack to continue to cool. The bibingka can be served at room temperature but are best served warm. They can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days, then reheated in a toaster oven or microwave before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 38651,&quot;Thanksgiving Bacon Roulade 1 pound bacon Kosher salt 4 ounces green beans, trimmed 1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes<br> 1/4 cup gravy, chilled, plus warmed gravy, for serving 3/4 cup grated sharp Cheddar (about 3 ounces) 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 1 ounce) 1 1/2 cups stuffing Cranberry sauce, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place a cooling rack on a rimmed baking sheet. Top with a 12-by-10-inch piece of parchment. Arrange the bacon slices horizontally on the parchment so they are overlapping to form a large rectangle the size of the paper. Bake until the bacon starts to shrink and render fat, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F.<br> Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of salted water to boil. Drop the green beans in the water and cook for 2 minutes, then remove to a strainer and run a little cold water over the beans to cool. To assemble the roulade, spread the potatoes on the bacon blanket in a 6-by-10-inch rectangle, leaving a border of uncovered bacon on all sides. With the back of a spoon, make 2 long troughs lengthwise down the center of the potatoes, leaving space between and around the troughs. Spoon the gravy into the troughs (keeping the gravy chilled prevents it from running all over the potatoes). Sprinkle the gravy and potatoes with the Cheddar. Arrange the green beans 2 to 3 across in a thin line on top of the Cheddar, in between the gravy troughs. Sprinkle the Parmesan over the green beans and potatoes.<br> Form the stuffing into a 10-inch log; you can use your hands to shape it or spoon the stuffing onto a piece of parchment and tightly roll it into a log. Place the stuffing log down the center of the bacon rectangle. Working from one of the long sides of the bacon rectangle, grab the parchment and pull it up and over the stuffing. Use the parchment to help you roll it into a roulade, making sure it ends up seam-side down. Bake the roulade until the bacon is cooked and crispy, about 30 minutes. Let rest for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board and slice into 1-inch slices. Serve with warm gravy and cranberry sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 38652,&quot;Pasta with Roasted Tomatoes 1 1/2 pounds plum tomatoes 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 zucchini, cut into 3/4-inch chunks Freshly ground pepper 12 ounces campanelle pasta (or other short pasta) 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 to 2 hot pickled cherry peppers, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 ounce) Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 475 degrees F. Quarter the tomatoes, then scoop the seeds and pulp into a sieve set over a bowl (reserve the tomatoes). Press on the seeds and pulp to extract the juice (you should have about 1/2 cup). Chop the tomatoes and toss with 3 tablespoons olive oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toss the zucchini with 3 tablespoons olive oil on a separate baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast, switching the position of the pans halfway through, until tender and browned in spots, 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta as the label directs; reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic; cook 2 minutes. Add the cherry peppers; cook 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste, then the reserved tomato juice and 1/2 cup cooking water. Bring to a boil; simmer until reduced by half, 5 minutes. Add the pasta, vegetables, basil and parmesan to the skillet; season with salt.

Add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to the sugar mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Spoon the batter into the prepared pans. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans and cool completely on the wire rack, about 1 hour. For the cinnamon buttercream: In a large bowl or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the butter on medium-high speed until pale and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. With the mixer on a slow speed, carefully add the confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup at a time until combined, followed by the vanilla and cinnamon. Add the heavy cream a little at a time. (If you need a thicker frosting, add more confectioners&#39; sugar; if you need a thinner consistency, add in more heavy cream.) Place a cooled cake layer on a cake stand. (This recipe should yield very level cake layers, but if your layers are domed, level them before assembling.) Cover with about 1/2 cup buttercream. Scatter 1/3 cup of chopped pecan over the top. Repeat with the next layer of cake, covering with 1/2 cup buttercream and 1/3 cup chopped pecans. Place the final layer of cake on top. Place the remaining buttercream in a pastry bag fitted with a large open star tip (such as #362). Pipe out a design on the top of the cake (the sides will be left \\naked). Sprinkle the remaining pecans over the top, then drizzle the cake with caramel sauce. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 38658,&quot;Tomato Tart 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 8 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter, cut into cubes 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons ice water, ice removed 4 ounces goat cheese 1 cup chopped roasted tomatoes 3 ounces pesto (made from basil or arugula), recipe follows 1 bunch grilled asparagus 1 pound heirloom tomatoes, sliced or halved if using cherry tomatoes 2 yellow onions, sliced and grilled 1 eggplant, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds and grilled 1 sweet bell pepper, grilled, peeled, seeded and cut into 1inch thick slices 1 cup bread crumbs 2 ounces grated Asiago 2 tablespoons basil oil, recipe follows Salt and pepper Field greens, as an accompaniment 3 cups packed arugula or 2 cups loosely packed basil leaves 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 garlic clove chopped 3 tablespoons olive oil 4 quarts water 3 tablespoons salt 2 cups basil leaves, packed 1 cup olive oil Instructions: To prepare pate brisee, place all ingredients except water in a metal mixing bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Mix with paddle attachment on mixer until butter is pea sized, and then add the water in one motion. Only mix the dough until just incorporated and remove bowl from mixer. Place dough on floured surface and mix by hand until all is incorporated. Form into a disk and refrigerate until ready to roll out, at least 1 hour. Roll dough on floured surface about 1-inch larger than desired pan size to allow for shrinkage. Lightly form the dough in the pan and refrigerate for 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the shell with parchment paper and fill with weights or dried beans. Pre-bake the brisee dough until slightly browned, about 10 minutes. Once cooked, remove from oven, remove weights, allow to cool, and then raise the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Spread the bottom of the tart with the goat cheese, a spoonful of roasted tomatoes, and then a layer of Pesto. Alternate the tomatoes, asparagus, onions, eggplant, and peppers then top with bread crumbs and Asiago. Salt and pepper each layer, drizzling a little oil on as well. Bake for 15 minutes and remove from oven. Allow to cool before serving, and for best results cut with a sharp serrated knife. Serve over field greens. In a food processor combine arugula, pine nuts, Parmesan, salt, and garlic and puree. With motor running add oil blending until incorporated. Store in the refrigerator with a piece of plastic wrap placed right on the surface of the pesto to prevent it from discoloring. Bring the water and salt to a boil. Blanch the basil leaves for 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of iced water and drain well. Dry for 1 hour. Blend basil and olive oil in blender or food processor. Process until well blended and strain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 38659,&quot;Cathedral Cookies 1 stick butter, cubed One 24-ounce bag semisweet chocolate morsels 1 egg<br> One 16-ounce bag multi-colored mini marshmallows<br> 1 cup finely chopped walnuts<br> Instructions: In a medium saucepan set over very low heat, melt the butter and chocolate.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay out 6 horizontal strips of bacon on the prepared baking sheet. Fold every other strip of bacon in half onto itself and lay one strip of bacon in the middle, vertical to the folded strips. Unfold the strips back over the vertical strip of bacon. Repeat this process using alternating vertical strips to weave into a lattice. (The bacon lattice should have an equal number of horizontal and vertical strips.) Bake until nearly cooked but still very pliable, about 15 minutes. Slide the bacon lattice into a 9-inch pie pan and press into place. Top the bacon with a paper towel, then a layer of foil and either another pie pan or pie weights to weigh it down. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then remove the weights and pat off any remaining excess oil with a paper towel. Meanwhile, thoroughly mix together the eggs, milk, spinach, potatoes, some salt and pepper and 1 cup of the Cheddar. Pour the egg mixture into the bacon crust and top with the remaining cup Cheddar. Bake until set and the cheese is browned, 30 to 45 minutes.

Snip off the carton with kitchen shears. Tightly wrap each ice cream round in plastic wrap, then form into a steak shape with your hands (the warmth of your hands will soften the ice cream). Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. Unwrap one ice cream steak and transfer to a piece of parchment or wax paper. Dip a metal skewer in hot water, then press into the ice cream to create parallel diagonal grill-mark lines. Make lines in the opposite direction to form a crosshatch pattern, dipping the skewer in hot water as needed. If the ice cream gets too soft, return to the freezer until firm. Fill the lines with the chocolate wafer crumbs. Transfer the steak to a baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. Repeat with the remaining ice cream steaks. Make the fries: Using a crinkle vegetable cutter or a chef&#39;s knife, trim the sides of the pound cakes, then cut each cake crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut each cake slice into strips. Divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Drizzle the melted butter over the pound cake fries and toss.

Add half the olive oil and heat. Pat the lamb shanks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper. Add 2 of the lamb shanks to the hot oil and brown on all sides, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer shanks to a plate. Repeat with the remaining olive oil and shanks. Add the garlic, celery, carrots and onions and to the pot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, use a vegetable peeler to strip the zest (just the orange skin, not the white pith underneath) from the orange in large pieces. Halve and juice the orange and set aside.<br> Add the red wine to the vegetables and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any browned bits that cling to the pot. Stir in the orange zest, currants, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook until the wine is syrupy, about 5 minutes.<br> Cut a square of cheesecloth and place the parsley stems, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, juniper berries, peppercorns and star anise in the center. Tie into a bundle with kitchen twine. Add the spice bundle, chicken broth, orange juice and the shanks, along with any collected juices, to the pot, bring the mixture to a boil, cover, and transfer to the oven. Cook about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, turning the shanks occasionally, until the meat is just falling off the bone.<br> Transfer the shanks to a plate. Scoop the vegetables from the liquid using a slotted spoon and set aside. Boil the cooking liquid over high heat until thickened, about 15 minutes. Add the lemon juice, and season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste. Return the shanks to the sauce and warm over medium heat, turning to coat evenly.<br> To serve, mound some of the polenta in the centers of 4 heated dinner plates. Top with a shank, and spoon some sauce and vegetables over and around the meat. Spoon a bit of Blood Orange Relish over each shank and serve immediately. Cut both ends from the oranges. Stand them on a flat end and cut away all of the peel and white pith. Quarter them top to bottom. Lay the wedges on their sides and slice them thinly crosswise. Slice the fennel crosswise into very thin slices.<br> Gently toss the oranges, fennel, apple, parsley, fennel seeds and vinegar together in a small bowl. Season with the salt and pepper. (This can be made a day ahead and refrigerated until ready to serve.) Bring the milk, chicken broth and salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Whisk in the polenta in a slow stream and cook, whisking constantly, until the polenta thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. When large bubbles begin to surface, remove from heat and stir in the cheeses and pepper. Taste and season with additional salt, if necessary.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barolo]&quot; 38703,&quot;Cheesy Sausage Breakfast Grits 1 pound ground breakfast sausage 3 cups lowfat (2 percent) milk 1 cup quick-cooking grits<br> 3 cups grated Cheddar<br> 4 large eggs<br> 1 tablespoon hot sauce<br> 4 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced, dark green tops reserved for garnish 4 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced, dark green tops reserved for garnish<br> 1 jalapeno, minced</p>",132)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
