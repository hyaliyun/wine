Softly textured, juicy with tighter final acidity. Screwcap.","designation":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"US","description":"This fruity, off-dry Riesling is sourced from the Lawrence Vineyards on the Royal Slope. Despite the relatively cool climate site, it has a ton of very ripe fruit, peaches and apricots. There is a slight bitterness, perhaps from skin contact, in the finish.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Scents of marshmallows and spun sugar are twined around flavors of lemon, candied orange peel and English Breakfast tea.

Buttered toast, butterscotch, apricot, tropical fruit and honey flavors are prominent. Ready to drink now.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Bright, fleshy dark-fruit flavors of plum, blackberry and boysenberry all unfold on the nose and in the mouth of this value-priced wine. Hints of mocha and pepper add interest to the palate, with approachable tannins and a balanced, easygoing structure.","designation":"Languedoc-Roussillon"},{"country":"es","description":"On first take, this smells like prunes, with little vitality. In the mouth, however, there's more pulse than the nose indicates, as tomato-like acidity drives the palate toward a mix of cherry tomato, red plum and oak flavors. A fresh but mild tasting finish ensures that this blend can accompany food without a problem.","designation":"Northern es"},{"country":"fr","description":"One of the two main cuves from La Chablisienne, the wine is fresh, fruity while having a tight, mineral character and a cool, fragrant feel.

A little clumsy now, but might gain traction in the cellar.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft, sweet and robust, with upfront cherry pie, red currant and plum flavors. Lots of spices, too, ranging from cinnamon and anise to black pepper.

It's a little sugary sweet, with raspberry, orange and vanilla flavors.","designation":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Starts out with grassy, gamy aromas that are not up to what I've tasted from Viu Manent.

Kind of gritty on the finish, where the tannins and acids combine.","designation":"Maule Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A broadly fruity mlange of red grapes, moderately tart and pleasant enough as a simple pizza and pasta red. At the listed 14.4% alcohol, you might hope for a bit more concentration.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"cl","description":"Pink and light, with a sharp nose that's sweaty and sour.

Overly zesty and tart; made from Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot.","designation":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Not much in the way of aromas except for flatness and apple juice.

Not fully vital; could already be past its prime.","designation":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Sulfur and matchstick on the nose is offputting, while what remains suggests oily green fruits. The palate is sharp and acidic, with green fruit flavors and a sharpness that suggests salad with vinaigrette.

On the plus side is extreme dryness and crisp acidity. You'll either love or hate this wine.","designation":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Smells a little too much like nail polish and cherry candy, while the acidic palate has a wiry mouthfeel and herbal, brambly red fruit flavors. Finishes herbal, with some carob. A snappy, simple-at-best wine.","designation":"Central Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Aggressive early on, with foxy, briary aromas of turned earth, olive, rhubarb and green tobacco. The palate is fleshy, soft and welcoming, but the flavors are a sketchy amalgam of bramble, leather and herbal raspberry. Mouthfeel is the best part.","designation":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A common, rustic wine, okay for drinking with everyday fare.

Precise and tangy, it offers some ripe berries and cranberries, and a pleasantly toasty finish.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"From the winery's premier vineyard comes this inky, earthy wine with woodsy aromas. Flavors of plum and pie cherry dominate the fruit, along with a definite smoky, charred flavor, perhaps from overroasted barrels.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Sangiovese and 20% Zinfandel. Spicy, light and fruity, it sports plenty of acid beneath tart red fruits. The addition of Sangiovese gives it a little bit of leather and toast for added interest.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"nz","description":"The nose is an interesting blend of cocoa, dill, cassis and lemon. Flavors pretty much follow suit, sneaking in some tobacco and cedar shadings before turning lean and lemony. The finish shows off a whack of dry, cedary French oak. Hard to know where this will be in five yearsmight dry out, might get interestingly complex.","designation":"Hawke's Bay"},{"country":"cl","description":"For a ros, this wine is hefty and bold, with strawberry and plum flavors, with a dash of earthiness.

It is still quite hard and compact, and seems likely to remain so.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"More oak than the wine can handle is what you get here, from the woody, buttery overtoasted nose through the soft, clumsy, creamy body.  It's a real challenge to find any fruit, so you had better like a fully wooded wine if you're going to take a crack at this one.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"With a sweet nose of honey, malt and Golden Delicious apples, this is a fairly weighty Chardonnay from an unheralded appellation. The slightly oily herb and peach flavors pick up more butterscotch on the finish, yet remain crisp and clean.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"This unusual Oregon Malbec carries intense, rustic aromas mixing plum, grape, spice and saddle leather. Despite its very tight tannins, the wine tastes open and grapey, reminiscent of a Washington Lemberger, though not quite as soft.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"za","description":"This is a grassy, lean bottling with a bit too much asparagus and vegetal notes on both the nose and palate. The flavor profile features some grapefruit and green apple, but the fruit is rather dilute and distant. Beyond that, the finish is dry, almost like drinking club soda.","designation":"Franschhoek"},{"country":"nz","description":"Not a typical nz Riesling, but one worth trying for its bold, oily apricot and tangerine aromas and flavors that smell sweet but taste dry, ending in a stone-cold finish.","designation":"Canterbury"},{"country":"fr","description":"Wild flowers and a touch of rubber make for a bouquet that at first is hard to appreciate.

Simple and easy to drink, it will go fine with basic fare.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"Yes, that is the official name for this tannic blend. It features tart berry fruit; a bit Zin-like; the tannins are substantial but well managed, without the chalkiness often found in southern Oregon. A good summer BBQ wine.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"This is made in a very rich style, with lots of forward fruit, flavors of pears, citrus and citrus rind. Somehow the floral elegance of the variety is lost in all the ripe fruit.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"Citrus and white flowers comprise the nose, with a touch of melon underneath the top tier of scents. Flavors of orange, citrus pith and green herbs lead into a juicy finish that at first offers roasted nuts and then fades away smoothly. Its major fault is high acidity, which leaves a somewhat sour overall impression.","designation":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Henry estate, Scott Henry explains, is more Alsace/Burgundy country, but we feel we are on the ragged edge of pulling these Bordeaux guys off. A fair and candid assessment. This is a lean, but not too green, Merlot.

The flavors are not particularly varietal; they are broader and more rustic, reminiscent of Carmenre. The palate impression is of soft, sweet, light blueberry fruit, for immediate drinking.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"cl","description":"Smoke and a refreshing minty note open this Casablanca Valley Pinot.

Moderately ripe red fruits, firm acids and balanced tannins tell the story.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"A perplexing wine that should be better than it is. It's fairly dense and concentrated, with good depth of flavor. Beets, tomatoes, blackberries, sugared espresso and a myriad of crushed, dusty oriental spices fill the mouth. It's good and dry, with crisp acids and easy tannins. So what's the problem? It just lacks that extra kick. Maybe Rex Hill is diverting the best fruit to their three expensive Pinots.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"The Sonoma County blend is warm and spicy, mixing a trace of alcoholic heat with black pepper. Mixed berries, dried fruits and a hint of raisins are all underscored by milk chocolate.

The wine only sees stainless steel, so the brightness of the fruit is what drives it forward.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"Surprisingly thin for an Alexander Valley Cabernet, especially at this price. It's clean and proper, being dry and softly tannic, but the cherry and blackberry flavors taste watered down.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Spicy, savory aromas of smoked nuts and coconut are brightened by clean, green floral notes on this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay.

Its aromas, which pop with notes of strawberry and spice, have both herbal and copper-penny undertones. The fruit and savory flavors play well off of each other, showing a sense of elegance and deftness, with a touch of new wood that contributes to the flavor and feel. The finish stretches out. It still drinks quite young and if the aromas meld together could move up a notch or two.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"at","description":"The fulsome, ripe flavor of yellow Mirabelle plums beckons and is joined by peppery watercress notes and the zest of freshly grated lemon peel.

This is by far Arrowood's greatest Chardonnay in recent memory.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a spectacular effort. Cascading flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are drenched in caramel, mocha and buttery barrel flavors. Although the wine lists at a hefty 14.9% alcohol, it does not sacrifice elegance, nor does it substitute power for polish. The rush of blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and currant fruit, the layers of smoke and graphite, and the immense barrel flavors just keep on rolling through the palate.

Based on Cabernet, with small quantities of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, it has oak-influenced black and red currant, cassis, cherry, spicy plum pudding and sweet, smoky vanilla flavors, with a cedar, pencil-lead note reminiscent of a fine Pauillac. Lush now, it should develop well through 2015.","designation":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"Structured and mineral, this is great Wachau Riesling.

The concentration is impressive for a wine that looks likely to need at least five years before drinking.","designation":"Wachau"},{"country":"US","description":"The Sorella is deep and dense with thick textures and tannins. The typical black currant and black cherry fruit character is here in spades, and yet at 14.4% alcohol the wine avoids any fatiguing jamminess or heat in the finish.

This interesting, even dramatic Cab should develop over the next decade.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A very fine Chardonnay notable for its concentration, power and elegance.
