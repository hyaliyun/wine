It's a very dense, focused Cab, a little too tightly wound to pop the cork quite yet.

Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Other wineries have produced very good vineyard-designated Cabs from this mountain property. Now Brandlin has a go, and the wine shows promise. It's considerably more tannic than most expensive New Age Napa Cabs, so dry and astringent that it demands cellar time.

Tannins are soft and plump.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine, from the man who invented the name \\"Fum Blanc,\\" is not for everyone. It's way on the citrus, hay, and gooseberry side of the chart (as it is in every vintage), making for a lean, tart, almost sharp drink that some will find sour despite softening with 6% Smillon and lees aging. Others will appreciate the sleek, almost severe elegance. Again, a wine that absolutely demands the right foods.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Very aromatic for Merlot, with ripe, sugary blackberry and black- cherry aromas.

Nice value, too.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The blend is 79% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon.

It's underscored with a quick, slightly chalky, tannic finish.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Made from sustainably-grown mountain grapes, this is a fruit-forward Cab Franc with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon blended in. It's subtle in the variety's classicly herbal qualities, but has a juicy softness and a whiff of coffee on the finish.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Amador Foothill's Clockspring Zin is aromatically reminiscent of its Rosato, with wafts of watermelon and pomegranate and a back splash of black pepper. Young still, enjoy with light barbecue fare, such as grilled chicken with salsa.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a tug of unripeness that shows up in this Pinot Noir, like a cross of mushrooms, green herbs and asparagus. Yet it has some good cherry and red currant sweetness, the alcohol is nice and low and the acidity is mouthwatering. Drink it now after a few minutes of chilling in the fridge.","designation":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"For Brut Nature, this has body and weight to it. The nose delivers dry apple and pear aromas, while the palate is fairly full and round for the style, with apple and lime flavors. A finish with roundness and density confirms this Cava's good quality.","designation":"Catalonia"},{"country":"es","description":"Yeasty white-fruit aromas of melon and peach set up a narrow feeling palate with nectarine and peach flavors.

The wine is smooth and one-dimensional on the finish. Try it with pasta or pizza.","designation":"Central it"},{"country":"fr","description":"Mushroom aromas indicate a wine that is now mature. It's light, textured with hints of green herbs as well as tannins that are now dry. Not for aging, drink now.","designation":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"fr","description":"Firm, closed wine that exhibits a strong tannin character. The wine is powerful and dense, its black plum fruits lying under the dry structure. There is a touch of alcohol burna shame in an otherwise well-made wine.","designation":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"US","description":"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty. The fruit is on a tight rein of acidity, which only slowly opens up to show mango, pineapple, crisp citrus, layers of toast and a mouth-enveloping richness. Age for at least five years, preferably 10.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"fr","description":"The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness. At the end, acidity lifts the wine, finishing with freshness as well as intensity.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Lots of fresh herbs and spices in this beautiful red wine. Offers loads of red and black currants and chocolate, with a fine application of cedar and cigar box from oak. Very fine, enormously likeable. Drink now through 2015.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"What makes a great Chablis grand cru? It's the intensity of flavor, which can be found in this wine. Its green and white fruits are layered with wood spice and an ineffable crispness that allows the wine to show the purity of Chardonnay and the great terroir at the same time.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors. Massive, yet refined and elegant, and even with the firm tannins, grows more charming as it warms in the glass. Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Voluptuous, lush, a wine of great power. Packed with cedar-inspired flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, currants, cassis, cola, licorice and spice, wrapped into a texture of velvet and silk. Delicious and compelling. Only 126 cases produced.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"A beautiful wine, a pure expression of ripe but steely Chardonnay. The wine floats onto the palate, with green plums and citrus leading. Then come toast, a mouthwatering acidity and a mineral structure. This wine's complexity just continues to impress.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"A drop-dead gorgeous red blend that continues Flora Springs' fine streak of Bordeaux-style wines.

Drink this high-quality wine now and through 2015.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power. This serious new Napa Cab is great now, and should develop for many years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Gigantic, huge. Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is from a sub-division of the Corton vineyard, at the northern end of the Grand Cru. It shows both depth of flavor and freshness, a ripe wine that brings in delicious, appetizing acidity and spicy toast. It will obviously age, the nuts and secondary flavors still waiting to show, but as a fruitier style it will be ready in a year.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells young and juvenile, a bit raw. Shows briary aromas of wild berries, thyme, cherries and mocha. A chewy wine, tannic and spicy. Hard now, a bit austere, but beautifully structured, with a thick, currant-infused taste. Needs time.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A brilliant Pinot Noir, grown organically from the winery's new vineyard in a cool part of the coastal mountains. More tannic and acidic than Pinots from the estate vineyard in Green Valley, it offers lush, deep flavors of cherries, black raspberries, gingersnap cookies and almond biscotti. Just terrific, and will take a few years of bottle age in a cool cellar.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Big, powerful brush strokes of ripe fruits, spice and rich creaminess paint this wine with vividness. The fruit envelops the mouth, the pears, green plums and ripe apples working with a citrus edge. Impressive, and with a great finishing freshness.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"There is a little Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Syrah (4%) in the blend also. This is a silky, yet muscular let's say it, masculinestyle of Merlot. Meaning that the fruit is concentrated with deep blue and black berry and cassis flavors, augmented with lead pencil. Beautiful polish and concentration characterize this wine, yet it's quite approachable.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Not as rich or concentrated as the previous vintage, and the acidity is low, making for a mushy texture. Still, the peach and tropical fruit flavors are good. Turns hot with alcohol on the finish.","designation":"California"},{"country":"za","description":"The palate is drenched in sweet oak and sugarplums. This is not to say that it is a syrupy quaff: there is also cocoa, toast, dried herbs and a note of eucalyptus that pinches at the finish.","designation":"Robertson"},{"country":"US","description":"Interesting to taste Saintsbury's Reserve next to the regular Chardonnay. Both naturally share the same taste and textural characteristics, but this wine is oakier and softer in the mouth, especially in acidity. It lacks the crispness and zest of the regular. Seems a bit heavy and flat, although it's still a nice wine.","designation":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Dried herbs, lots of spice and some black raspberry carry the bouquet. Fruit is front and center; the palate is all cherry and black pepper, and the finish brings more red fruit and firm tannins. It's mostly a one-song act, meaning it's clean, spicy and adequately fruity.","designation":"Northern es"},{"country":"au","description":"This Chard is a straightforward, good quaffer, with a light, pleasant sweetness more suited for late-summer picnics than dinner parties. Offers crisp yellow fruit, plus light citrus and mineral notes on the palate; on the nose, the fruit is tropical. Drink it before the weather gets too crisp.","designation":"au Other"},{"country":"za","description":"A tight, green note of eucalyptus persists throughout the cherry, plum and oaken layers. The tannins are powdery and strong while the acidity is clean and refreshing.","designation":"Western Cape"},{"country":"US","description":"This Bordeaux blend features charred, barrel-driven aromas along with leather and black-fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and acidic, with plum and raspberry flavors poking through a heavy coating of concrete tannins. The finish is equally tight and grippy, and here the tannins are even more pronounced. Very tight and hard; time in the cellar could be the prescription.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells good and rich, with waves of plum, blackberry, tar and smoke aromas, and the flavors are very similar. Drinks dry and tasty in the mouth, but loses a few points for a gritty tartness through the finish.","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"A straight-ahead Riesling, pleasant but uncomplicated. Minerals envelop white stone fruit on the palate; the fruit is more fruit skin than flesh. Nose is light and feminine, with citrus and confectioners' sugar notes.","designation":"Western au"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft, easy and well-made, this wine is quite sweet, but pleasant, with apple blossom and ripe pear aromas and flavors of apples, pears and apricot.","designation":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"Sweet and ripe, with intense flavors of apples and pears. Decent acidity keeps it from becoming cloying, but this comes close to being dessert-sweet.","designation":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"A nice little red blend, easy to drink, with cheerful flavors of blackberries and cherries that are very ripe without being in your face. Entirely dry, with light tannins. Enjoy with everything from sandwiches to steak.","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"A flavorful Chardonnay, with a backbone of ripe, tropcial fruit and apples. Toast and caramel notes sing loudly, though, from beginning to end (the wine was aged in French and American oak hogsheads)steer clear if you're averse to wood.","designation":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Aromas of snap peas and minerals come in front of grapefruit, apple and lemon flavors. This wine has both a stony, crisp core as well as a plump, chewy texture. The finish is at once tangy and lean, but also fairly driven. Not an easy wine to wrap your arms around and assess, but not bad either.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"From a Mendocino producer who defends this appellation as Bordeaux country, a rather rough wine, compared to its southerly neighbors from Napa and Sonoma. Blackberry fruit barely ripened, and there are green, stalky flavors in this dry, fairly tannic wine.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Pretty tannic now, with underlying fruity flavors of plum, blackberry, herbs and earth. Drinks very dry and a bit austere, and there's tartness in the dusty finish. May gain with an additional year or two of age.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A generic, regional South-Central Coast Pinot showing berry, cola, herb and sauted mushroom flavors encased in soft, silky tannins and crisp acids. Has little complexity and best consumed now.","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"Nice floral, pear and vanilla notes waft from the nose. Its body is on the soft side, but the sweetish, white stone fruit-and-citrus profile (and its bargain price) are surefire crowd pleasers.","designation":"au Other"},{"country":"za","description":"Aromatic, ashy oak wafts around a slip of sweet red fruit. This thin, plummy fruit is sustained on the palate, where the acidity keeps it from being too sweet. The finish is chock-full of eucalyptus and dried mint.","designation":"Stellenbosch"},{"country":"US","description":"Lean and earthy, marked by tobacco, dill and less than ripe cherry flavors. Tannins are tough and gritty. The wine finishes very dry and rasping, showing little fruit. The winemaker seems to have understood the problem here, and added five percent Syrah.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Simple and earthy, with coffee and spiced plum flavors. Curiously lean and one-dimensional for such a great vintage. The tannins are soft and melted and acids are also easy.","designation":"California"},{"country":"za","description":"Oaken layers make themselves known from nose to finish, with notes of cream, vanilla and cinnamon. The fruit thins out midpalate, revealing bright acidity and insistent tannins. A good pour for an everyday dinner.","designation":"Vlootenburg"},{"country":"US","description":"Sweet and honeyed, but with enough tongue-tingling acidity to keep it almost in check, this is a well-made sweet table wine. Aromas and flavors blend tangerines and ripe apples.","designation":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit lean in fruit, in keeping with this problem vintage. Aromas of damp earth, cigar and thyme have just a hint of blackberry. The tannins are very finely ground, and soft acidity makes for a pleasant mouthfeel, but it's thin stuff.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A Julia Roberts of a Merlot, pretty and innocent, maybe a little clueless. But who cares? It's fruity, dry, and fun, and even has some layers of complexity. Best of all, it doesn't cost too much. Drink up!","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"This Chard offers a fair dose of oak (and the creamy-toasty goodness that goes with it), yet has tropical yellow fruit to back up the wood. Soft in the mouth; finishes dry and oaky.","designation":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Aromas of white pepper and pear start it off, and it smells snappy and inviting. The palate is all about grapefruit and orange; in a word, it's citrusy. The finish comes in waves, with notes of stone fruit and licorice. As a whole it's round and satisfying, but it's also a tad bit dilute and dull, which is why it rates where it does.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"At four-plus years, the tannins are resolved, although far from absent. Acidity is also high. Finally the wine is coming around, with spicy plum and cassis flavors, but it is teetering on the verge of old age already, and has an edge of senility.","designation":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Rubbery, plastic-like aromas of black fruits come with a burnt, smoky edge.

It's an easy, simple wine to drink now, offering white sugar, orange, lime, green melon and vanilla flavors.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"This oak-aged Chardonnay opens with aromas of candied fruit and butterscotch. The bouquet presents oxidized aromas, with creamy yellow-fruit and vanilla bean flavors.","designation":"Sicily & Sardinia"},{"country":"US","description":"This seems to have some residual sugar, as there is a grainy, sugary aspect to the light pear and melon flavors.

It has a juicy cherry flavor and ripe acidity, with a tangy, textured finish.","designation":"Beaujolais"},{"country":"US","description":"Judging by the high-heeled shoe on the label, this is one of those wines aimed at the female consumer. It's Pinot in name only, with clean, simple cherry candy and oak tastes.","designation":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dark in color, this wine has an oaky and earthy nose, with a compost streak.

As a result, the wine has a thin taste.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"There's too much oak on this wine, and the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support it. The result tastes like toothpicks, with modest flavors beneath of tangerines and pears.","designation":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Quite an unusual specimen in that you don't often see Monastrell mixed with Cabernet and Shiraz.

It has a dark and very structured aftertaste.","designation":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"US","description":"Sometimes in a challenging vintage such as 2009, it is the least expensive, blended wines that benefit most, perhaps because grapes normally destined for the single-vineyard wines are redirected.

A nice everyday Cab that doesn't overstep its limitations.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"A very tasty, ripe Zinfandel, lush and forward with wild berry, tobacco, cocoa, pepper flavors and something animal-rich, almost livery, like foie gras.

This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026.","designation":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"it","description":"Ripe black-skinned fruit, underbrush, truffle and dark spice aromas come together in this full-bodied red. The palate is firm and seamless, delivering mature black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and pipe tobacco flavors with both power and finesse. Tightly knit, polished tannins provide structure. Drink 2022C2032.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"au","description":"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink nowC2030.","designation":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases. Raspberry, rose petal, cola and cinnamon stick show on the nose, while the palate offers rounded flavors of dried strawberry, thyme and game. It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Captivating wild berry, rose, chopped herb and baking spice aromas take center stage in this earthy, stunning wine. The palate mirrors the nose in vibrancy, delivering tight layers of wild cherry, star anise and white pepper notes. Fresh acidity and firm, refined tannins provide a polished framework. It's loaded with finesse and already delicious, but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020C2032.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"fr","description":"Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins. There is a strongly juicy aftertaste that brings in the freshness of the year. The wine will age well, and should not be drunk before 2026.","designation":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"fr","description":"The wine is rich with layers of wood aging and ripe tropical fruits. Pineapple and peach dominate, cut with some attractive lime acidity. Full of the fruit of the vintage with a texture of serious intent, the wine is tight, tangy and likely to age well. Drink from 2022.","designation":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"it","description":"Dark spice, ripe berry, forest floor, Mediterranean brush and new leather aromas lead the nose on this powerfully structured wine. On the full-bodied palate, baking spice, licorice and pipe tobacco notes accent a juicy black cherry core while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink 2020C2030.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"fr","description":"The wine is powered both by its tannins and by its great fruit. Dark and dense both in the structure and the black-plum flavors, it is very fine wineC juicy and ripe. This is a serious wine with a great future. Drink from 2026.","designation":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"fr","description":"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.","designation":"Alsace"},{"country":"US","description":"Seductive and velvety, this concentrated Pinot Noir is richly layered in raspberry cherry cordial, cardamom and cola flavors. Pine and allspice notes contribute a homey spiciness as as the fullness of the wine lingers into a long finish.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Forest floor, aromatic herb, dark spice and eucalyptus aromas come together with a floral twist. Bright and elegant, the palate shows succulent wild cherry, white pepper, star anise and chopped mint flavors. With its taut, fine-grained tannins and firm acidity, it needs time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2022C2032.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"A perennial standout, this Syrah is cofermented with 10% Viognier, all fruit sourced from a site on the western edge of Sonoma Mountain in the cool confines of the Petaluma Gap. Beautiful and bold, it imparts a focused line of blackberry and lavender flavors over a lush backdrop of sizzling acidity and smoked meat scents.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Coming from this exceptional winery the term reserve (or in this case, riservata) actually means a great deal. Flavors are broad and deep and entwined with plum, cherry compote, soy and chocolate. The length and power are impressive: these flavors just don't quit.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine defines luxurious texture, at once velvety, richly layered and bright. From one of the warmer sites in a cool climate zone, it complements its fruit concentration with deeper sarsaparilla, vanilla, tea and cardamom scents, the finish delightfully playful in orange peel accents.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Initial tight acidity in this crisp wine gives way to smooth rich black fruits. This already has a fine balance with its ripe juiciness and delicious red-berry flavors. It is going to develop into a very fine wine.
