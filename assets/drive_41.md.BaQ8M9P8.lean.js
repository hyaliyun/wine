This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.","designation":"XIC"},{"country":"es","description":"Jammy berry aromas are baked, horsey and fold in a note of cherry. A gritty palate with full tannins scrapes at your cheeks, while plum and cherry flavors are loud at first then fade away on a raisiny, sweet finish.

Too much harshness and not nearly enough core fruit or cushion.","designation":"Staccato"},{"country":"cl","description":"Tight, pure blackberry and cassis aromas are composed. This is a better-balanced wine than the sticky, overly oaked 2012 version. Leading toasty chocolate flavors go well with secondary spiced berry and cassis notes. A note of vanilla comes out on the finish.","designation":"La Finca Clos D'Angel"},{"country":"cl","description":"Starts with stemmy, burnt aromas but after time oak notes cover things up. Apple, sweet pear, buttery oak and popcorn are the main flavors on this sweet, pithy wine that when stripped down is fairly hollow and simple.","designation":"Special Selection"},{"country":"es","description":"At first, this black-colored Garnacha smells horsey and reduced, but with time it exudes more aromatic harmony and quality. A big tannic palate is rough like sandpaper. Blackberry, pepper and chocolate flavors don't rise to a level of excellence, while a heavy saturated finish closes out this muscular red.","designation":"Picos Pardos"},{"country":"us","description":"A plummy, semi-sweet dark red wine that could stand a bit of a chill in the fridge.

Good value.","designation":"Sangiovese - Shiraz"},{"country":"us","description":"To call this Cabernet huge is an understatement. The tannins are hard and dramatic. As for the fruit, you can hardly find strong enough descriptors. It shows blackberry jam and black currants, cassis liqueur and minerals raised to fabulous mountain concentration.

Streaks of coffee and milk chocolate are in the mix, but it's the excellent fruit that captures your attention and holds it.","designation":"Dundee Hills Cuv√©e"},{"country":"us","description":"Bj√∂rnson's Pinots are difficult to differentiate. This one is labeled Estate, but is also a barrel selection; the other is also estate but not labeled as such.

It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.","designation":"Vino Rosso"},{"country":"fr","description":"With some wood fermentation, this is a particularly rich wine.

It's really too jammy now, with its wealth of cherries, berries, currants, chocolate and pepper. Unless you like this kind of immediate fruity pleasure, give it a sleep in the cellar. Better after 2009.","designation":"Grist Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Almond and anise open what evolves into a concentrated expression of a stellar vineyard site in a great vintage in good winemaking hands.

It has been aged partially in new French oak but doesn't come off as oaky.","designation":"Catherine's Vineyard Estate Grown"},{"country":"fr","description":"Very earthy notes precede a subdued nose of citrus zest. These tart but expressive notes open up a little more on the palate where they are joined by a rounded, if crunchy structure.

This is intriguing and needs time to unfold its fruit and unusual texture.

It rounds out the citrus flavors and adds apricot and green plums. The result is an attractive fruity wine that will be better from the end of 2016.","designation":"Terres Blanches"},{"country":"us","description":"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.","designation":"Susanna's Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"This is the producer's first barrel-aged Chardonnay, made from a blend of two vineyards and two clones, including one from their own estate on Westside Road.

Drink now‚Äì2020.","designation":"La Decelle"},{"country":"cl","description":"A full spectrum of Chilean SB aromas are present, from grass to citrus to tropical fruits to vegetal notes. This feels fresh but more or less regular. Flavors of green fruits come with grassy interjections, while the finish is good and clean.","designation":"Corralillo"},{"country":"cl","description":"Forceful aromas of pie crust and heavy berry fruits are clumsy but generous. There's elastic tightness to the palate along with herbal berry flavors. The finish loses fruit while cranking up the toasty afterburners.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"at","description":"A rather neutral nose leads to a simple, dry, fresh palate. There is a little citrus and green pear flavor. This is easy-drinking, fresh summer wine.","designation":"Una"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine's aromas are perfectly pretty but with a sharp edge, blending tight boysenberry, raspberry and red-apple with lilac and scarlet-red rose-petal florality and an anise-peppercorn spice. The palate is full, soft and yet focused, with dried strawberry, plum and red cherries giving way to pencil lead and sage.","designation":"Block Q Old Vine Bien Nacido Vineyard"},{"country":"za","description":"Here's an intense and brooding Shiraz with fantastic depth and character. Aromas of whole bacon slab, kirsch, black berry and cigar tobacco prime the palate for the full flavor experience. The creamy mouthfeel is loaded with black fruit flavors integrated with sweet woody spice throughout. The finish is long and the impression strong. Pair with an equally flavorful dish to avoid the wine being overwhelming.","designation":"Cathedral Cellar"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a big, dark and concentrated wine with exotic spicy, oaky aromas, rich and ripe fruit flavors, an absolutely creamy, mouthfilling texture and lingering finish. Deft touches of graphite and cedar in the aromas meet generous black plum, mint and cherry on the palate.","designation":"Split Rail Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"This is an estate-grown white, unfettered by oak, that opts instead to focus on floral apple-blossom aromas and bright, fresh flavors of tangerine and grapefruit zest. A bite of green apple shines on the finish.","designation":"Teresa's Unoaked Estate Grown Estate Bottled"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a hugely structured and concentrated wine, the double plusses marked on barrel selections meant to call out the best of the best. Herbal, it offers complex characteristics of dried herb, cedar and leather, with a big grip of tannin tenacious on the palate and peppery finish.","designation":"Double Plus Estate Grown"},{"country":"it","description":"The nose is subdued but eventually reveals whiffs of pressed white flower and dried herb. The rather lean palate offers hints of green pear, citrus, mineral and a note of bitter almond.","designation":"Quin"},{"country":"us","description":"This blend of 69% Syrah and 31% Grenache is smoky and oaky, with a strong charred meat flavor that obscures its lightly ripe strawberry fruit. The finish is simple and light.","designation":"Syrache Ampelos Vineyard"},{"country":"pt","description":"This wine features soft apple and pear fruit with light tannins and grapefruit freshness. It is clean, well-made and ready to drink.","designation":"Branco"},{"country":"lb","description":"Deep garnet to the eye, this Rhone-style blend has a nose of cherry and aniseed. Flavors of cherry, blueberry preserves, fennel bulb, anise and violet are set in a framework of smooth tannins that gently coats the mouth beyond the bright finish.","designation":"Terrasses de Baalbeck"},{"country":"fr","description":"A beauty in every respect. The nose is perfectly toasted, with attractive apple and peach nuances. The palate feel and its full-fruit flavors build into a crescendo of Champagne style. It‚Äôs clean, lusty and just the right call for a celebratory evening. Mouthfuls of total harmony don‚Äôt come often and they don‚Äôt come cheap.","designation":"Comtes de Champagne Brut Ros√©"},{"country":"it","description":"This Grechetto-based wine has a pretty straw appearance and definitely puts an emphasis on nuts, melon and stone fruit. Thanks to a smooth mouthfeel and spicy finish, it does liven up in the mouth.","designation":"Poggio della Costa"},{"country":"fr","description":"This crisp blend of Braucol and Syrah comes from a gravel terrace. While it has fine acidity, the wine also has ripe red fruits, sweet plum flavors and an attractive sprinkling of spice. Drink this wine from 2017.","designation":"Les Gravels"},{"country":"es","description":"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.","designation":"Negre"},{"country":"de","description":"Fresh herb and lime notes brighten this smoky, intensely mineral Riesling. While dry and quite sprightly in style, it has a lush, silky mouthfeel that adds a perception of weight and expansiveness. Drink now through 2018.","designation":"Ng.1 Schweigen-Rechtenbach Trocken"},{"country":"us","description":"This is an elaborately constructed wine, rich in fruit and tannins, and far better than the rather ordinary 2006. But it's nowhere near ready to drink now. Erupts with ripe, juicy blackberries, black cherries, minerals and sweet cassis. The grapes are from the Pope Valley region. Very big, bold and dramatic, but immature. Hold for a good six years.","designation":"Date Night"},{"country":"de","description":"Blossomy perfume wafts throughout this squeaky fresh off-dry Riesling. Tart tangerine and punchy yellow peach and mango flavors are vibrant and crisp, resonating long on the finish. It's a straightforward yet balanced, fruity wine. Drink now.","designation":"Nik Weis Selection Urban"},{"country":"fr","description":"This light-bodied Merlot ros√© is a summer delight. Hints of strawberry blossom and citrus mark the nose, while the palate features berry shadings set against a backdrop of citrus, something like a dry, adult version of pink lemonade.","designation":"Classique Merlot"},{"country":"us","description":"About 40% is  barrel aged and put through malolactic. This is a heavier, more substantial effort than their regular Chardonnay, with more butterscotch flavors showing. With good fruit, some weight and texture, it's well made and a good value.","designation":"Blue Moon"},{"country":"fr","description":"Intensely fruity, ripe and full-bodied. It has delicious apple and apricot flavors, bursting out of the glass with pure enjoyment. Lively acidity gives an extra dimension of brightness. Drink now.","designation":"Le Chenin"},{"country":"fr","description":"Heavy wood aromas from new French oak barrels show equally strongly as dark chocolate flavors on the palate from this 50/50 Merlot/Malbec blend. The wine, tiny production from 2.5 acres, is all wood, very firm and tough. Only the acidity suggests a potential fruitiness. This estate has been in the No√´l family since 1800.","designation":"Excellence"},{"country":"fr","description":"While this wine is certainly dry, it holds a hint of honey in the baked-apple flavor and tight texture. It's still very young and needs to open up until 2015 to give a less shocking, more rounded acidity.","designation":"Les Grandes Brosses"},{"country":"pt","description":"A black, solid wine, spiced heavily with wood but still showing blackberry flavors, textured with plum skins. The wine feels warm and ripe, finishing with black cherries and lingering softness.","designation":"Grand'Arte"},{"country":"us","description":"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.","designation":"The Novelist"},{"country":"us","description":"Cloudy and exuberant in saltwater taffy, this wine is crisp and vivid in lemon, tangerine and vanilla. The oak is well behaved and game to provide structure without obstruction. Pear and apple give it weight and body with a stony minerality playfully drawn on the finish.","designation":"Allen Vineyard"},{"country":"pt","description":"From vines in the upper Douro region (the Cima Corgo), this is ripe and soft. It has attractive juicy black fruits and soft tannins. There is a juicy, perfumed character from the Touriga Nacional in the blend. Drink the wine now.","designation":"Alma Grande Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a rich, delicious and balanced Pinot. It defines the modern California style, being dry, silky and ripe, showing a wealth of raspberry, cherry, cola, persimmon and spice flavors. Oak adds rich notes that are perfectly in keeping with the fruit. Drink this savory wine over the next few years.","designation":"No. 7 Sonoma Collection"},{"country":"fr","description":"Firm and structured, this wine offers dark tannins and concentration. It has the acidity of the year but with a solid texture. There are hints of the perfume and the delicious fruit to come, but they will take time to show. Don't drink this wine with its potential before 2022.","designation":"Les Por√™ts-Saint-Georges Premier Cru"},{"country":"at","description":"Amid the pear and apple fruit plays a more exotic note of something alluring and spicy, perhaps passion fruit. This intense fruitiness plays on, supported equally by bouncy citrus freshness and deep concentration.","designation":"Kirchensteig Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, spice and red fruit, along with high-toned vanilla accents. The fruit and barrel flavors are plush and full, while still showing a lovely sense of balance.","designation":"Indian Wells"},{"country":"us","description":"This hearty blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot is what put Justin on the map, and it still impresses with its elegantly woven tobacco, leather, cocoa, blueberry, and caramel aromas. It hits the palate softly, showing black cherry, baking spice, milk chocolate and faint mint notes, ending in a finish that reveals a firm tannic structure.","designation":"Isosceles"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},V={class:"card-container"};function M(s,i,t,c,u,a){const f=p("PoemCard");return n(),r(l,null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",V,[(n(!0),r(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(o,y)=>(n(),m(f,{key:y,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...o)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...o))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const P=h(D,[["render",M]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/41.md","filePath":"drive/41.md"}'),j={name:"drive/41.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(n(),r("div",null,[w(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,G as default};
