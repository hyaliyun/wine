It offers an undeniable hit of Dr. Pepper and wild mushrooms grown on a forest floor.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Amazingly lush and delicious in blackberry and cherry pie, mocha and sweet new-oak flavors, this blend is also tannic to the point of being undrinkable at this time. You definitely want to give it until at least 2022 in the bottle.","province":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"This wine shows exceptional freshness on the nose with newly mown grass, hay and lemon fruit. Yarraman is Aboriginal for ‚Äúwild horse‚Äù and the palate has an appropriate kick to it, with crisp acidity suppporting complex lanolin, citrus and pineapple flavors. The finish is surprisingly long. Drink now.","province":"au Other"},{"country":"US","description":"Aromas of fresh, savory herbs are in the lead, followed by plum, vanilla and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are elegant with a firm squeeze of tannins backing them up. It needs time to come together but has all the stuffing.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"fr","description":"The Baylet family has produced a rich wine in this vintage. With chocolate and spice flavors accenting its black plum fruit, it's ripe and smooth. The tannins are well integrated into the generous fruit. Drink from 2018.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"US","description":"Lean and earthy, marked by tobacco, dill and less than ripe cherry flavors. Tannins are tough and gritty. The wine finishes very dry and rasping, showing little fruit. The winemaker seems to have understood the problem here, and added five percent Syrah.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Complex earthy spicy savory flavors make this Grenache-based wine a great escape from simply fruity bottles. It's fragrant with smoke and black pepper in the aroma, filled with ripe plum, toffee and cardamom on the palate and has a full mouthfilling texture.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This has flavors of pineapple, orange and buttered toast, with lots of brisk acidity. It offers the oaky creaminess that many Americans love.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"Spicy yeast notes rather than fruit or citrus take over and make for a light-bodied, fresh but rounded white that will be best with food, presenting savory notes that will echo any spiciness. It's a versatile, peppery white with lots of Gr√ºner spice.","province":"Nieder√∂sterreich"},{"country":"de","description":"Waxy floral aromas are pretty, but suggest a slightly plastic note on this light-footed Riesling. It's delicately sweet, boasting flavors of fresh yellow peach and pear accented by hints of bramble and earth. The finish is crisp and clean.","province":"Mosel"},{"country":"pt","description":"This is a fresh and fruity wine that has ripe berry fruits that are shot through with acidity. This wine is developing fast and will be ready to drink from the end of 2016.","province":"Alentejano"},{"country":"US","description":"Although the 2011 vintage was difficult, Foris did particularly well with this lightly spicy, fruit-laden Pinot Gris. True varietal flavors of pear and apple are perfectly set against vivid acidity.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"ar","description":"Plum and raspberry aromas are wiry in nature and ‚Äúred‚Äù in character. The wine feels healthy and not overly heavy, with roasted, slightly herbal flavors of berry fruits and creamy oak. A spicy, lightly herbal finish ends this Malbec-Syrah-Merlot blend in solid fashion. Drink through 2015.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Ripe plum, game, truffle, leather and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this earthy wine. The tightly wound palate offers dried black cherry, chopped sage, mint and roasted coffee bean alongside raspy tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"cl","description":"Quite oaky and soft, with minty, shoe polish and lemony aromas on top of big, ripe, sweet fruit scents. The palate is sticky and leans up against medicinal, while the flavors of blackberry and plum have a mild candied, baked note to them. Just doesn't have the balance and touch of a fine Cabernet.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Golden hay in color, this fragrant, vineyard-designated estate wine offers floral jasmine on the nose before delving into notes of minerality and savory herb. Substantial on the palate without becoming overbearing, it's both elegant and memorable.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Crisp, mineral and tight, this is still a young bottling. It is dry, full of citrus-fruit flavors and with a fine burst of acidity that cuts through the wine. Let this delicious wine settle for a few more months to add more fruit to the texture. Drink from late 2018.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a dry, robust Syrah, packed with blackberry, blueberry, anise, bacon and pepper flavors, and wrapped into sturdy tannins. Give it a decant, and drink with game or Mexican beef dishes.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Dominated by ripe S√©millon, this is a rich wine. It has a touch of herbaceousness, but the yellow fruits, pears and stroke of lemon give a full-bodied, rounded feel. Wood aging adds further to the satisfying flavors.","province":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"it","description":"It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso.

Drink 2015‚Äì2020.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"Kevin Riley likes to toss in lots of little bits into his blends, and this one features 11 different grape varieties. Baked strawberries and red plums show on the nose, along with dewy herbs, crushed gravel, dried oregano, basil and smoke. Light red fruit is present on the palate, along with caramel and vanilla. It's a fresh and lively wine, if not super complex.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"From the site made famous by Merry Edwards along the appellation's Laguna Ridge, this wine envelops dark cherry, strawberry and herb flavors along a brooding, softly velvet and voluptuously body, weighted slightly in toasted oak and firm tannin.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"A heavy oak character controls the nose, and with it comes aromas of sawdust, vanilla, cocoa and raspberry. This feels a bit sticky and creamy, while palpable oak returns on the palate and creates vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors. Heat, high acidity and peppery spice work the finish on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmen√®re and Syrah.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"High alcohol and very ripe fruit combine to make this reminiscent of Port. It tastes of black currant and blackberry jam, with a hint of raisin. Although it won't please everyone, it is a good example of its warm-climate style.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results. The wine is dry, silky and interesting, showing an array of cherry, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors. Has enough of a complex tannin structure to pair with lamb chops, or a great grilled salmon steak.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"This 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with milk chocolate, cherry, exotic spice, blackberry jam and cr√®me de cassis notes. The mouthfeel is chewy, rich and plush, and the supple tannins are followed by loads of dark berry fruit.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"Far Niente has produced a tannic, drily astringent young wine that's nowhere near ready to drink. It's tough as nails, with a gritty astringency that locks down the black currant and dark, unsweetened chocolate flavors. But it is a very balanced, distinguished wine that should easily negotiate the next 10 or 15 years, with proper cellaring.","province":"California"},{"country":"gr","description":"The nose on this white appeals from the get-go. Elegant waves of lemon, orange blossom and peach aromas are followed by a balanced but luxurious blend of pear, peach and white flowers on the palate.
