The finish is delicious with a long cherry-flavored fade.","designation":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"The best things about this Merlot are its extreme dryness, tannin integrity and relative austerity. It's a pleasure to drink a Merlot that's not a fruit bomb. That doesn't mean you won't find complex flavors of blackberries and currants. You will.

This is always the most thick and dense of the Stevens wines, and the tannins, though very well managed, are chewy and substantial.
